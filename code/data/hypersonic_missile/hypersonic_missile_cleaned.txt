the_ground launched cruise_missile, or glcm, (officially designated bgm-109g_gryphon)
was a_ground-launched_cruise_missile developed by the_united_states_air_force in the_last_decade of the_cold_war and disarmed under the_inf_treaty.
overview ==
the_bgm-109g was developed as a_counter to the_mobile_mrbm_and_irbm_nuclear_missiles (ss-20_saber) deployed by the_soviet_union in eastern_bloc_european_countries.
the_glcm and the_u.s._army's_pershing_ii may have been the_incentives that fostered soviet_willingness to sign the_intermediate-range_nuclear_forces_treaty (inf_treaty), and thus possibly reduced the_threat of nuclear_wars in europe.
glcm is also a_generic_term for any_ground-launched_cruise_missile.
since the_u.s. deployed only_one_modern_cruise_missile in the_tactical_role, the_glcm_name stuck.
glcm was built by general_dynamics.
history ==
design and employment ===
a_conventionally_configured_cruise_missile, the_bgm-109 was essentially a_small,_pilotless_flying_machine, powered by a_turbofan_engine.
unlike ballistic_missiles, whose_aimpoint is usually determined by gravitic_trajectories, a_cruise_missile is capable of complicated_aerial_manoeuvres, and can fly a_range of predetermined_flight_plans.
also, a_cruise_missile flies at much_lower_altitudes than a_ballistic_missile, typically with a_terrain-hugging_flight_plan.
the_trade-off for this_low-observability_flight is strike_time; cruise_missiles travel far more slowly than a_ballistic_weapon, and the_glcm was typical in this_regard.
the_glcm was developed as a_ground-launched_variant of the_tomahawk_missile in use by the_u.s._navy (along with an_undeveloped_air-launched_version, the_medium_range_air to surface_missile (mrasm))
unlike other_variants of the_tomahawk, the_glcm carried only_a_w84_thermonuclear_warhead; no_conventional_capability was provided.
only_a_w84_thermonuclear_warhead is a_0.2–150kt_variable-yield_weapon.
this_yield contrasts with the_yield of only_a_w84_thermonuclear_warhead found on other_versions of the_tomahawk and on the_alcm from which the_w84 was derived, which has a_selectable_yield of 5_or_150_kt.
the_pentagon credited the_glcm with a_range of 2000–2500_kilometers.
like other_u.s._cruise_missiles of this_period, accuracy after more_than_2000_km of flight was approximately_30_meters.
the_missile was entirely subsonic, powered by a_turbofan_engine with a_rocket_booster assisting at launch.
militarily, the_glcm was targeted against fixed_targets—at the_outer_edge of the_glcm range, the_missile's_flight_time with the_glcm subsonic turbofan was more_than_2½_hours.
the_missiles were launched from an_elevated_launcher, with the_missile ejected from the_missile canister for about_13_seconds of solid_rocket_booster_flight.
the_fins extended at 4_seconds, the_air_inlet and wings deployed at 10_seconds and the_jet_engine started at the_end of the_boost_phase.
flying at low_level, the_missile was guided by tercom (terrain_contour_matching) to the_target.
this contrasted strongly with pershing_ii, which had a_flight_time of 10–15_minutes.
however, the_range of the_glcm gave the_range of the_glcm
the_ability to strike deep within then-soviet_territory, and the_missile_guidance and low_radar_cross-section would have made it far more difficult to intercept a_glcm even if the_launch were detected in time.
g_personnel were trained at davis-monthan_air_force_base, arizona, by the_868th_tactical_missile_training_squadron from 1 july 1981.
on 1_october 1985, the_868th_tactical_missile_training_squadron became part of the_868th_tactical_missile_training_group.
the_group and squadron were inactivated on 31_may 1990.
an_area near fort_huachuca, arizona was used for field_training for glcm_flights.
glcm_testing was conducted at the_dugway proving ground in utah, with many of the_people involved in glcm_testing going to operational_wings as operational_wings were activated.
nato_deployment and protests ===
g_missiles would be based at six_locations throughout europe; in the_united_kingdom (at raf_greenham_common and raf_molesworth),_belgium, netherlands, germany, and comiso_air_station in italy.
each_location had each_location own unique_problems, but all required extensive_construction by the_usaf.
initial_operating_capability (ioc) occurred in 1983.normal basing was in blast_shelters at military_installations.
each_bgm-109g_station was controlled by a_wing that consisted of a_tactical_missile_squadron (tms), which was responsible for operation and deployment of the_missiles; and a_tactical_missile_maintenance_squadron (tmms), which was responsible for the_support of the_system.
each_tms consisted of several_flights, made up of 69_people and 22_vehicles.
the_missile was designed to operate in a_flight with sixteen_missiles.
a_flight with sixteen_missiles would be normally on base, with the_missiles and vehicles secured in the_hardened_storage_area called the gama (glcm_alert_and_maintenance_area).
four_transporter_erector_launchers (tel)
each carried four_bgm-109g_missiles in  each_containers and ready for launch.
two_launch_control_centers (lcc), each with two_launch_officers, were connected to the_tels and interconnected for launch.
each_tel and lcc was towed by a_large_man_kat1 8x8_tractor and was capable of traversing rough_terrain.
there were 16_support_vehicles for the_flight_commander, normally_a_captain, 19_maintenance_technicians, a_medical_technician and 44_security_personnel.
during periods of increased_tension, the_flights would be deployed to_pre-surveyed,_classified_locations in the_countryside away from the_base.
the_members of the_flight would dig in, erect camouflage_netting to hide the_vehicles, and prepare for launch.
flight_commanders were tasked to survey and select possible_deployment_sites, with all_details closely held, and the_commander selected the_location preferred when the flight deployed from the_base.
when deployed, the_flight was self-sustaining, and secured with special_intrusion_detection_radar.
the_launchers (without warheads) were sent out on a_number of simulated_scrambles.
although deployed in the_face of a_range of soviet_irbms, including the_brand-new_and_extremely_capable_ss-20_saber, the_glcm (sometimes referred to by its_phonetic_nickname, glick-em) faced widespread_public_protest in europe.
anti-nuclear_groups such as the_campaign for nuclear_disarmament felt that the_united_states was deploying weapons meant to win a_tactical_nuclear_war, without adequate_consideration of the_effects that even_a_'victory' would bring.
critics also argued that the_reagan_administration was unduly escalating tensions in central_europe.
between the_reagan_administration was_unduly_escalating_tensions in central_europe, glcm and pershing_ii made a_lethal_combination.
glcm_missiles could be launched, undetected, followed 2 hours later by a_pershing_strike, which would fly so quickly that it was possible
no_response could be made before the_pershings struck.
aside from presenting a_course of action to nato_commanders in the_event of war, it put the_kremlin_leaders (in range of the_glcm and possibly_the_pershing, even in moscow) in a_position of fearing a_decapitating_nato_first_strike, which could have moved them toward a_launch on warning policy as the_only_way to maintain mutually_assured_destruction.
however, the_ussr did have submarine-launched_missiles (i.e. golf and hotel class ssbns armed with
r-27_zyb and ss-n-5s) available during this_time, so any_fears of a_decapitating_first_strike were not necessarily justified.
intermediate-range_nuclear_forces_treaty ===
despite initial_fears of greater_instability, the_deployment of glcm ultimately caused soviet_leaders to enter into negotiations for, and finally_signature of,_the_inf_treaty.
the_recognition by soviet_leaders of the_threat posed by the_glcm_and_pershing_ii_missiles made soviet_leaders of the_threat posed by the_glcm_and_pershing_ii_missiles far more inclined to agree to negotiate soviet_leaders of the_threat posed by the_glcm_and_pershing_ii_missiles own_intermediate-range_weapons, especially the ss-20, out of service, in exchange for the_elimination of the_threat posed by the_glcm and the_pershing_ii.unlike_salt_ii or start i, which set limits to maximum_nuclear_arsenals, the inf treaty banned whole_categories of intermediate-range_tactical_nuclear_weapons outright.
all_ground-launched_cruise_missiles and ballistic_missiles with ranges greater than 500_but_less_than_5500_kilometers were barred to the_u.s. and ussr under the_inf_treaty.
this meant the_withdrawal of glcm and pershing_ii on the_american_side.
the_soviets withdrew the_glcm's_most_direct_counterpart, the_ssc-4 or rk-55, and  the_soviets supersonic follow-on, the ssc-x-5.
in addition, various_soviet_mrbms, irbms, and lrbms were withdrawn: the_ss-4_sandal, ss-5_skean,
ss-12_scaleboard,_ss-20_saber, ss-22 scaleboard_b, and ss-23_spider.
all of these_equivalent_weapons had been developed and deployed against nato_forces before the_introduction of the_glcm, despite the_categorization of the_glcm deployment by communists as 'aggressive'.
the_glcm was removed from europe beginning in 1988, and over the_next_three_and_a_half_years all_units were transported to davis_monthan_afb and destroyed or converted into displays by 1991.
eight_missiles survive for inert_static_display only.
in february 2018, u.s._military_officials confirmed u.s._military_officials were developing a_new_ground-launched,_intermediate-range_cruise_missile to counter russian_development of a_similar_weapon_system that violates the_inf_treaty.
president_donald_trump announced on 20_october 2018 that president_donald_trump was withdrawing u.s. from the_inf_treaty, citing russian_non-compliance.
u.s._u.s. formally suspended the_inf_treaty on 1_february 2019, and russia did so the following day.

the_tomahawk_()_land_attack_missile_(tlam) is a_long-range,_all-weather,_jet-powered,_subsonic_cruise_missile that is primarily used by the_united_states_navy and royal_navy in ship-_and_submarine-based_land-attack_operations.
designed at apl/jhu, the_tomahawk ()_land_attack_missile_(tlam) was initially produced in the_1970s by general_dynamics as a_medium-_to_long-range,_low-altitude_missile that could be launched from a_surface_platform.
the_missile's_modular_design accommodates a_wide_variety of warhead, guidance, and range_capabilities.
at_least_six_variants and multiple_upgraded_versions have been introduced since then, including air-, sub-, and ground-launched_variants and conventional_and_nuclear-armed_ones.
as of 2019, only_non-nuclear,_sea-launched_variants assembled by raytheon are currently in service.
the_u.s._navy contracted with apl/jhu to design bgm-109_tomahawk_missile, the_project was headed by james_walker at applied_physics_laboratory near laurel, maryland.
since then, it has been upgraded several times with guidance_systems for precision_navigation.
in 1992–1994, mcdonnell_douglas_corporation was the_sole_supplier of tomahawk_missiles and produced block_ii_and_block_iii_tomahawk_missiles and remanufactured many_tomahawks to block iii_specifications.
in 1994, hughes outbid mcdonnell_douglas_aerospace to become the_sole_supplier of tomahawk_missiles.
in 1994, hughes outbid mcdonnell_douglas_aerospace to become the_sole_supplier of tomahawk_missiles is now manufactured by raytheon.
in 2016, the_u.s._department of defense purchased 149_tomahawk_block_iv_missiles for $202.3 million.
tomahawk was most recently used by the_u.s._navy against syrian_chemical_weapons_facilities when 66 were launched in the_2018_missile_strikes against syria.
variants ==
there have been several_variants of the_missile, including: bgm-109a tomahawk_land_attack_missile – nuclear (tlam-n) with a_w80_nuclear_warhead.
retired from service sometime between 2010 and 2013.
reports from early_2018_state that the_u.s._navy is considering (re)introducing a_(yet_unknown_type of) nuclear-armed_cruise_missile into service.
rgm/ugm-109b_tomahawk_anti-ship_missile (tasm) – active_radar homing anti-ship_missile_variant; withdrawn from service in 1994 and converted to block_iv_version.
bgm-109c tomahawk_land_attack_missile – conventional (tlam-c) with a_unitary_warhead.
this was initially a_modified_bullpup_warhead.
bgm-109d_tomahawk_land_attack_missile – dispenser (tlam-d) with cluster_munitions.
rgm/ugm-109e_tomahawk_land_attack_missile (tlam_block_iv) – improved_version of the_tlam-c. bgm-109
g_ground launched cruise_missile (glcm) – with a_w84_nuclear_warhead;
withdrawn from service in 1991 to comply with the_inf_treaty.
agm-109h/l medium range air-to-surface missile (mrasm) – a_shorter-range,_turbojet_powered_air-launched_cruise_missile with cluster_munitions; never entered service, cost us$569,000 (1999).ground-launched_cruise_missiles (glcm) and
their_truck-like_launch_vehicles were employed at bases in europe; their_truck-like_launch_vehicles were withdrawn from service to comply with the_inf_treaty.
many of the_anti-ship_versions were converted into tlams at the_end of the_cold_war.
the_block_iii_tlams that entered service in 1993 can fly 3_percent farther using 3_percent new turbofan engines and use global_positioning_system (gps)_receivers to strike more precisely.
block_iii_tlam-cs retain the_digital_scene_matching_area_correlation (dsmac) ii_navigation_system, allowing three_kinds of navigation: gps-only, which allow for rapid_mission_planning, with some_reduced_accuracy, dsmac-only, which take longer to plan but terminal_accuracy is somewhat better; and gps-aided missions that combine dsmac ii and gps navigation for greatest_accuracy.
block_iv_tlams have an_improved_turbofan_engine that allows block_iv_tlams to get better_fuel_economy and change speeds in flight.
block_iv_tlams can loiter better and have an_electro-optical_sensors that allow real-time_battle_damage_assessment.
the_block_ivs can be given a_new_target in flight and can transmit an_image, via satcom, immediately before impact to help determine whether the_missile is on target and the likely damage from the_attack.
==_upgrades ==
a_major_improvement to the_tomahawk is network-centric_warfare-capabilities, using data from multiple_sensors (aircraft, uavs, satellites, foot_soldiers, tanks, ships) to find the_tomahawk target.
the_tomahawk will also be able to send data from the_tomahawk sensors to these_platforms.
tomahawk_block_ii_variants were all tested during january 1981 to october 1983.
deployed in 1984, some of the_improvements included: an_improved_booster_rocket, cruise_missile_radar_altimeter, and navigation through the_digital_scene_matching_area_corellator (dsmac).
dsmac was a_highly_accurate_rudimentary_ai which allowed early_low_power_computers to navigate and precisely target objectives using cameras on board the_missile.
with  dsmac ability to visually identify and aim directly at a_target,  dsmac was more accurate than weapons using estimated_gps_coordinates.
due to the_very_limited_computer_power of the_day,  dsmac did not directly evaluate the_maps, but instead would compute contrast_maps and then combine multiple_maps into a_buffer, then compare the_average of those_combined_images to determine if it was similar to the_data in it small_memory_system.
the_data for the_flight_path was very_low_resolution in order to free up memory to be used for high_resolution_data about the_target_area.
high_resolution_data about the_target_area was computed by a_mainframe_computer which took spy_satellite_photos and estimated what the_terrain would appear like during low_level_flight.
since this_data would not match the_real_terrain exactly, and since terrain_changes seasonally and with changes in light_quality, dsmac would filter out differences between maps and use the_remaining_similar_sections in order to find dsmac location regardless of changes in how the_ground appeared.
dsmac also had an extremely bright strobe light dsmac could use to illuminate the_ground for fractions of a second in order to find dsmac position at night, and was able to take the_difference in ground_appearance into account.
tomahawk_block_iii introduced in 1993 added time-of-arrival control and improved_accuracy for digital_scene_matching_area_correlator (dsmac) and jam-resistant_gps, smaller, lighter wdu-36 warhead, engine improvements and extended missile's range.
tactical_tomahawk_weapons_control_system (ttwcs) takes advantage of a_loitering_feature in the_missile's_flight_path and allows commanders to redirect the_missile to an_alternative_target, if required.
the_missile can be reprogrammed in-flight to attack predesignated_targets with gps_coordinates stored in the_missile memory or to any other gps_coordinates.
also, the_missile can send data about the_missile status back to the_commander.
the_missile entered service with the_us_navy in late 2004.
the_tactical_tomahawk_weapons_control_system (ttwcs) added the_capability for limited_mission_planning on board
the_firing_unit (fru).tomahawk_block_iv introduced in 2006 adds the_strike_controller which can change the_missile in flight to one of 15_preprogrammed_alternate_targets or redirect the_missile to a_new_target.
this_targeting_flexibility includes the_capability to loiter over the_battlefield awaiting a_more_critical_target.
the_missile can also transmit battle_damage_indication_imagery and missile_health and status_messages via the_two-way_satellite_data_link.
firing_platforms now have the_capability to plan and execute gps-only_missions.
block_iv also has an_improved_anti-jam_gps_receiver for enhanced_mission_performance.
block_iv includes tomahawk_weapons_control_system (ttwcs), and tomahawk_command and control system (tc2s).on 16 august 2010, the_navy completed the_first_live_test of the joint multi-effects warhead system (jmews), a_new_warhead designed to give the_tomahawk the_same_blast-fragmentation_capabilities while introducing enhanced_penetration_capabilities in a_single_warhead.
in the_static_test, a_single_warhead detonated and created a_hole large enough for the_follow-through_element to completely penetrate the_concrete_target.
in february 2014, u.s._central_command sponsored development and testing of the_jmews, analyzing the_ability of the_programmable_warhead to integrate onto the_block_iv_tomahawk, giving the_missile_bunker_buster_effects to better penetrate hardened_structures.
in 2012, the_usn studied applying advanced anti-radiation guided missile (aargm) technology into the_tactical_tomahawk.
in 2014, raytheon began testing block_iv_improvements to attack sea and moving land_targets.
the_new_passive_radar_seeker will pick up the_electromagnetic_radar_signature of a_target and follow the_new_passive_radar_seeker, and actively send out a_signal to bounce off potential_targets before impact to discriminate the_new_passive_radar_seeker legitimacy before impact.
mounting the_multi-mode_sensor on the_missile's_nose would remove fuel_space, but company_officials believe the_navy would be willing to give up space for the_sensor's_new_technologies.
the_previous_tomahawk_anti-ship_missile, retired over a decade earlier, was equipped with inertial_guidance and the_seeker of the_harpoon_missile and there was concern with the_harpoon_missile ability to clearly discriminate between targets from a_long_distance, since at the_time navy_sensors did not have as_much_range as the_missile itself, which would be more reliable with the_new_seeker's_passive_detection and millimeter-wave active_radar_homing.
raytheon estimates adding the_new_seeker would cost $250,000 per missile.
other_upgrades include a_sea-skimming_flight_path.
the_first_block_iv_tlams modified with a_maritime_attack_capability will enter service in 2021.a_supersonic_version of the_tomahawk is under consideration for development with a_ramjet to increase its_speed to mach 3.
a_limiting_factor to this is the_dimensions of shipboard_launch_tubes.
instead of modifying every_ship able to carry cruise_missiles, the_ramjet-powered_tomahawk would still have to fit within a_21-inch-diameter_and_20-foot-long_tube.
in october 2015, raytheon announced the_ramjet-powered_tomahawk had demonstrated new_capabilities in a_test_launch, using the_ramjet-powered_tomahawk onboard camera to take a_reconnaissance_photo and transmit the_ramjet-powered_tomahawk to fleet_headquarters.
the_ramjet-powered_tomahawk then entered a_loitering_pattern until given new_targeting_coordinates to strike.
by january 2016, los_alamos_national_laboratory was working on a_project to turn unburned_fuel left over when a_the_ramjet-powered_tomahawk reaches los_alamos_national_laboratory target into an_additional_explosive_force.
to do this, the_missile's_jp-10_fuel is turned into a fuel air explosive to combine with oxygen in the_air and burn rapidly.
the_thermobaric_explosion of the_burning_fuel_acts, in effect, as an_additional_warhead and can even be more powerful than the_main_warhead itself when there is sufficient_fuel left in the_case of a_short-range_target.
the_tomahawk_block_v is planned to go into production in 2020, the_block_va being the_maritime_strike_tomahawk (mst) which allows the_missile to engage a_moving_target at sea and the_block_vb outfitted with the_jmews_warhead for hard-target_penetration.
all_block_iv_tomahawks will be converted to_block_v_standard, while the_remaining_block_iii_missiles will be retired and demilitarized.
in 2020, los_alamos_national_laboratory reported that los_alamos_national_laboratory would use corn-based_ethanol to produce domestic_fuel for tomahawk_missiles, which also does not require harsh_acids to manufacture, compared to petroleum-based jp-10.
launch_systems ==
each_missile is stored and launched from a_pressurized_canister that protects  each_missile during transportation and storage, and also serves as a_launch_tube.
these_canisters were racked in armored_box_launchers (abl), which were installed on the_four_reactivated_iowa-class_battleships uss_iowa, uss_new_jersey, uss_missouri, and uss_wisconsin.
the_abls were also installed on eight_spruance-class_destroyer, the_four_virginia-class_cruiser, and the_nuclear_cruiser uss_long_beach.
these_canisters are also in vertical_launching_systems (vls) in other_surface_ships,_capsule_launch_systems (cls) in the_later_los_angeles-class_submarine and virginia-class submarines, and in submarines'_torpedo_tubes.
all_abl_equipped_ships have been decommissioned.
for submarine-launched_missiles (called ugm-109s), after being ejected by gas_pressure (vertically via the_vls) or by water_impulse (horizontally via the_torpedo_tube), a_solid-fuel_booster is ignited to propel the_missile and guide the_missile out of the_water.
after achieving flight, the_missile's_wings are unfolded for lift, the_airscoop is exposed and the_turbofan_engine is employed for cruise_flight.
over water, the_tomahawk uses inertial_guidance or gps to follow a_preset_course; once over land, the_tomahawk_weapon_system is aided by terrain_contour_matching (tercom).
terminal_guidance is provided by the digital scene matching area correlation (dsmac) system or gps, producing a_claimed_circular_error probable of about_10_meters.
the_tomahawk_weapon_system consists of the_missile, theater_mission_planning_center (tmpc)/afloat_planning_system, and either_the_tomahawk_weapon_control_system (on surface_ships) or combat_control_system (for submarines).
several_versions of control_systems have been used, including: v2_twcs – tomahawk_weapon_control_system (1983), also known as "green_screens," was based on an_old_tank_computing_system.
v3_atwcs – advanced_tomahawk_weapon_control_system (1994), first_commercial off the_shelf, uses hp-ux.
v4_ttwcs – tactical_tomahawk_weapon_control_system, (2003).
v5_ttwcs –
next_generation_tactical_tomahawk_weapon_control_system.
on august 18, 2019, the_united_states_navy conducted a_test_flight of a_tomahawk_missile launched from a_ground-based_version of the_mark_41_vertical_launch_system.
it was the_united_states'_first_acknowledged_launch of a_missile that would have violated the_1987_intermediate-range_nuclear_forces_treaty, from which the_trump_administration withdrew on august 2.
==_munitions ==
the_tlam-d contains 166_sub-munitions in 24_canisters: 22_canisters of seven each, and two_canisters of six each to conform to the_dimensions of the_airframe.
munitions == are the_same_type of combined_effects_munition_bomblet used in large_quantities by the_u.s._air_force with the_cbu-87_combined_effects_munition.
two_canisters of six each to conform to the_dimensions of the_airframe are dispensed two at a_time, one per side.
the_missile can perform up_to_five_separate_target_segments which enables  the_missile to attack multiple_targets.
however, in order to achieve a_sufficient_density of coverage typically all_24_canisters are dispensed sequentially from back to front.
navigation == tercom –
terrain_contour_matching.
a_digital_representation of an_area of terrain is mapped based on digital_terrain_elevation_data or stereo_imagery.
this_map is then inserted into a_tlam_mission which is then loaded onto the_missile.
when the_missile is in flight the_missile compares the_stored_map_data with radar_altimeter_data collected as the_missile overflies
based on comparison_results
the_missile's_inertial_navigation_system is updated and the_missile corrects  the_missile's_inertial_navigation_system course.
tercom was based on, and was a_significant_improvement on, "fingerprint," a_technology developed in 1964 for the_slam.dsmac – digital_scene_matching_area_correlation.
a_digitized_image of an_area is mapped and then inserted into a_tlam_mission.

operational_history == ===
united_states_navy ===
in the_1991_gulf_war, 288_tomahawks were launched, 12 from submarines and 276 from surface_ships.
the_first_salvo was fired by the_destroyer uss_paul_f._foster on january 17, 1991.
the_attack_submarines uss_pittsburgh and uss_louisville followed.
on 17_january 1993, 46_tomahawks were fired at the_zafraniyah_nuclear_fabrication_facility outside baghdad, in response to iraq's_refusal to cooperate with un_disarmament_inspectors.
one_missile crashed into the_side of the_al_rasheed_hotel, killing two_civilians.
on 26_june 1993, 23_tomahawks were fired at the_iraqi_intelligence_service's_command_and_control_center.
on 10_september 1995, uss_normandy launched 13_tomahawk_missiles from the_central_adriatic_sea against a_key_air_defense_radio_relay_tower in bosnian_serb_territory during operation_deliberate_force.
on 3_september 1996, 44_ship-launched_ugm-109_and_b-52-launched_agm-86_cruise_missiles were fired at air_defense_targets in southern_iraq.
on 20_august 1998, 79_tomahawk_missiles were fired simultaneously at two_targets in afghanistan and sudan in retaliation for the_bombings of american_embassies by al-qaeda.
on 16_december 1998, 325_tomahawk_missiles were fired at key_iraqi_targets during operation_desert_fox.
in early 1999, 218_tomahawk_missiles were fired by u.s._ships and a_british_submarine during 1999_nato_bombing of yugoslavia against targets in the_federal_republic of yugoslavia.
in october 2001, about_50_tomahawk_missiles struck targets in afghanistan in the_opening_hours of operation_enduring_freedom.
during the_2003_invasion of iraq, more_than_802_tomahawk_missiles were fired at key iraqi targets.
on 3_march 2008, two_tomahawk_missiles were fired at a_target in somalia by a_us_vessel during the_dobley_airstrike, reportedly in an_attempt to kill saleh_ali_saleh_nabhan, an_al_qaeda_militant.
on 17_december 2009, two_tomahawk_missiles were fired at targets in yemen.
one_tlam-d struck an_alleged_al-qaeda_training_camp in al-ma’jalah in al-mahfad, a_region of the_abyan_governorate of yemen.
amnesty_international reported that 55_people were killed in the_attack, including 41_civilians (21_children, 14_women, and six_men).
the_us_and_yemen_governments refused to confirm or deny involvement, but diplomatic_cables released as part of united states diplomatic_cables leak later confirmed the_missile was fired by a_u.s._navy_ship.
on 19_march 2011, 124_tomahawk_missiles were fired by u.s._and_british_forces (112_us, 12 british) against at_least_20_libyan_targets around tripoli and misrata.
as of 22_march 2011, 159 ugm-109 were fired by us_and_uk_ships against libyan_targets.
on 23_september 2014, 47_tomahawk_missiles were fired by the_united_states from uss_arleigh_burke and uss_philippine_sea, which were operating from international_waters in the_red_sea_and_persian_gulf, against isil_targets in syria in the_vicinity of raqqa, deir_ez-zor, al-hasakah and abu_kamal, and against khorasan_group_targets in syria west of aleppo.
on 13_october_2016_five_tomahawk_cruise_missiles were launched by uss_nitze at three_radar_sites in yemen held by houthi_rebels in response to anti-ship_missiles fired at us_navy_ships the day before.
on 6_april 2017, 59_tomahawk_missiles were launched from uss_ross (ddg-71) and uss_porter (ddg-78), targeting shayrat_airbase near homs, in syria.
the_strike was in response to a_chemical_weapons_attack, an_act allegedly carried out by syrian_president_bashar_al-assad.
u.s._central_command stated in a_press_release that tomahawk_missiles hit "aircraft, hardened_aircraft_shelters, petroleum and logistical_storage, ammunition_supply_bunkers, defense_systems, and radars".
initial_u.s._reports claimed "approximately_20_planes" were destroyed, and that 58 out of the_59_cruise_missiles launched had "severely degraded or destroyed" their_intended_target.
a_later_report by us secretary of defense james mattis claimed that the_strike destroyed about_20% of the_syrian_government's_operational_aircraft.
syrian_state-run_media claimed that nine_civilians, including four_children living in nearby_villages were killed and another seven wounded as a_result of the_strike after missiles fell on nine_civilians, including four_children living in nearby_villages homes, but the_pentagon said civilians were not targeted.
according to the_satellite_images the_runways and the_taxiways have been  undamaged_and_combat_flights from the_attacked_airbase resumed on 7_april a few hours after the_attack, although u.s._officials did not state that the_runway was a_target.
an_independent_bomb_damage_assessment conducted by imagesat_international counted hits on 44_targets, with some_targets being hit by more_than_one_missile; these_figures were determined using satellite_images of the_attacked_airbase 10 hours after the_strike.
however, the_russian_defense_ministry contends that the_combat_effectiveness of the_attack was "extremely low"; only_23_missiles hit the_base destroying six_aircraft, and the_russian_defense_ministry did not know where the other 36 landed.
russian_television_news, citing a_syrian_source at the_airfield, said that nine_planes were destroyed by the_strikes (5_su-22m3s, 1_su-22m4, and 3
and that all_planes were thought to have been out of action at the_time.
al-masdar_news reported that 15_fighter_jets were damaged or destroyed and that the_destruction of fuel_tankers caused several_explosions and a_large_fire.
however, lost_armour's_online_photographic_database, for vehicle_losses in the_war in syria, has images of 10_destroyed_aircraft at shayrat_airbase.
some_observers conclude that the_russian_government—and therefore_also_the_syrian_government—was warned and syria had enough_time to move most of the_planes to another_base.
the_syrian_observatory for human_rights said the_strike damaged over_a_dozen_hangars, a_fuel_depot, and an_air_defense_base.
on april 14, 2018, the_us launched 66_tomahawk_cruise_missiles at syrian_targets near damascus and homs, as part of the_2018_bombing of damascus and homs.
these_strikes were done in retaliation for alleged_douma_chemical_attack.
the_united_states_department of defense said syria fired 40_defensive_missiles at the_allied_weapons but did not hit any_targets.
the_russian_military said that syrian_air_defenses shot down 71 of the_103_missiles launched by the_us_and_syrian_allies.
royal_navy ===
in 1995 the_us agreed to sell 65_tomahawks to the_uk for torpedo-launch from the_uk nuclear attack submarines.
the_first_missiles were acquired and test-fired in november 1998; all_royal_navy_fleet_submarines are now tomahawk capable, including the_astute-class.
the_kosovo_war in 1999 saw the_swiftsure-class_hms_splendid become the_first_british_submarine to fire the_tomahawk in combat.
the_uk subsequently bought 20_more_block_iii to replenish stocks.
the_royal_navy has since fired tomahawks during the_2000s_afghanistan_war, in operation_telic as the_british_contribution to the_2003_iraq_war, and during operation_ellamy in libya in 2011.
in april 2004, the_uk and us_governments reached an_agreement for the british to buy 64 of the_new_generation of tomahawk_missile—the_block_iv or tactom_missile.
it entered service with the_royal_navy on 27_march 2008, three months ahead of schedule.
in july 2014 the_us approved the_sale to the_uk of a_further_65_submarine-launched_block_iv's at a_cost of us$140m including spares and support; as of 2011 the_block_iii_missiles were on british_books at £1.1m and the_block_iv at £0.87m including vat.the_sylver_vertical_launching_system on the_new_type_45_destroyer is claimed by the_new_type_45_destroyer manufacturers to have the_capability to fire the_tomahawk, although the_a50_launcher carried by the_type 45 is too short for the_weapon (the_longer_a70_silo would be required).
nevertheless, the type 45 has been designed with weight_and_space_margin for a_strike-length_mk41 or sylver_a70_silo to be retrofitted, allowing type 45 to use the_tlam_block_iv if required.
the_new_type_26_frigates will have strike-length_mk41_vls_tubes.

following the_album's_announcement, fender himself performed the_fastest_selling_date ever at the_mouth of the_tyne_festival as well as supporting bob_dylan and neil_young at hyde_park, london.
fender built  fender own studio in  fender hometown of north_shields to record the_album with money from  fender record label.
fender worked with  fender long-time friend and producer_bramwell_bronte on the_record despite the_suggestion from his_record_label to work with a_high_brow_producer, a_fact that  fender has said  fender is proud of.
music and lyrics ==
hypersonic_missiles drew heavy_comparisons to bruce_springsteen due to fender's_"lyricism and bruce_springsteen vignettes of working-class_struggle.
" many also drew comparisons to the_killers_and_jeff_buckley_blending_elements of americana, post-punk_and_pop_rock.
the_title_track was described by fender as being inspired by a_"newly_developed_russian_missile that travels at something like nine_times_the_speed of sound" as well as describing the_song's_protagonist as being a_"tin_foil_hatter.
the_track "the_borders" was described by fender as fender favourite and most_personal_song on the_album and describes the_"story of two_boys growing up together and then going their_separate_ways."
nme described the_track as "chest-punching".
the_guardian described the track's "hypnotic, motorik beats" as well as the_drum_machines on "you’re not the only one" to the_war on drugs.
fender tackles fender own entitlement on the_track "white_privilege" and has said that fender white privilege "has affected my_success, definitely, white boy with a_guitar, fucking great, original, here
comes another_one. "
dead_boys" tackles the_theme of male_suicide and mental_health_issues and was written as a_reaction to losing a_friend to suicide.
the_track has been described as "stark" and "cathartic."
the_track "play god" was described by fender being "set in an_alternate_dystopian_reality that shares similarities with our_own_world."
that_sound" was described as being "a_celebration of music" and "a_not-so-subtle_middle_finger to the_naysayers that tend to rear their_heads as soon as things start to work out for you, especially back home."
clash_magazine described it as "crisp_power_pop, it soars towards the_crunching_chorus, a real ear-worm that stays stuck in your_head for days. ""
" was described by fender at a_gig at electric_brixton in london as being about "hating your_landlord."
will we talk?"
was described as "a_heady_blast of high-octane, melody-packed, smash'n'grab rock'n'roll that launches from the_traps at full_pelt and doesn't relent until the_guitars and a_string-section subside three minutes later. "
the_track is about_one-night_stands and is inspired by "the_cut"_nightclub in newcastle.
call me_lover" is about infidelity and was inspired by an_affair with a_married_woman that fender had at 19.

leave fast" was described by the_line of best_fit as "an_excellent_study on provincial_fear."
the_track stems from the_fear of staying in your_hometown forever.
the_track "use" was described by pitchfork as entering nina_simone-inspired_territory.
critical_reception ==
hypersonic_missiles received critical_acclaim from critics.
at metacritic, which assigns a_normalized_rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream_publications, the_album received an_average_score of 81, based on 11_reviews.
alexis_petridis of the_guardian praised the_album, calling the_album "perfectly imperfect rock".
jordan_basset of the_nme after giving the_album 4 out of 5, added that "the_geordie_springsteen's_debut excels at documenting small-town_frustration, which is why jordan_basset means so much to so_many_people.
the_album isn't perfect, but jordan_basset's_a_welcome_antidote to polite_chaps with guitars".
allmusic claimed "it reveals it to be a_fitting_soundtrack to the_weekend, addressing hopes and frustrations with a_persistent_intensity and rousing_melodies that fall in line with the_catharsis at hand."
in a_more_mixed_review, pitchfork claimed that the_album had a_lack of focus and was full of "mostly_formulaic_arrangements".

hypersonic_technology_vehicle 2 (htv-2) is an_experimental_hypersonic_glide_vehicle developed as part of the_darpa_falcon_project capable of flying at 13,000_mph
(mach_17.53,_21,000_km/h).
mach 17.53,_21,000_km/h) is a_test_bed for technologies to provide the_united_states with the_capability to reach any_target in the_world within one_hour
(prompt_global_strike) using an_unmanned_hypersonic_bomber_aircraft.
development ==
the_falcon_htv-1_program, which preceded the_falcon_htv-2_program, was conducted in april, 2010.
the_mission ended within nine_minutes from launch.
both_these_missions are funded by the_us_defense_advanced_research_projects_agency (darpa) to help develop hypersonic_technologies and to demonstrate the_us_defense_advanced_research_projects_agency (darpa) effectiveness.
under the_original_plan, htv-1 was to feature a hypersonic lift-to-drag ratio of 2.5, increasing to 3.5-4 for the htv-2 and 4-5 for the_htv-3.
the actual lift-to-drag ratio of htv-2 was estimated to be 2.6.htv-2 was to lead to the_development of an_htv-3x_vehicle, known as blackswift, which would have formed the_basis for deployment around 2025 of a_reusable_hypersonic_cruise_vehicle, an_unmanned_aircraft capable of taking off from a_conventional_runway with a 5,400 kg (12,000_lb) payload to strike targets 16,650 km away in under_2_hours.
the_hcv would have required a lift-to-drag ratio of 6-7 at mach 10 and 130,000_ft (40,000m).
design == development of protection_structures that are tough and lightweight,_development of an_aerodynamic_shape that has a_high_lift to drag ratio,_development of automatic navigation control systems etc.
were some of the_initial_technical_challenges that had been overcome in the_final_design.
the_various_departments involved in designing the_vehicle included aerothermodynamics, materials_science, hypersonic_navigation, guidance and control systems, endo-
and_exo-atmospheric_flight_dynamics, telemetry and range_safety_analysis.
the_craft could cover 17,000_kilometres (11,000_mi), the_distance between london and sydney, in 49_minutes.
built by lockheed_martin_corp, the_htv-2 is made of carbon_composite_material; the_durability of such_material was needed to prevent important_internal_components from being destroyed because being destroyed are a_few_inches from the_htv-2 surface.
the_surface_temperature of the_htv-2 was expected to reach 1,930_°c (3,500_°f) or more in flight; steel melts at 1,370_°c (2,500_°f).
flight_testing ==
both_flights reached mach 20 (high-hypersonic_speed) and lost telemetry at 9_minutes of a_planned_30-minute_mission.
the_htv-2's_first_flight was launched on 22_april 2010.
the_htv-2_glider was to fly 4,800 miles (7,700_km) across the_pacific to kwajalein at mach 20.
the_htv-2 was boosted by a_minotaur_iv_lite_rocket launched from vandenberg_air_force_base, california; the_glider was carried inside the_nose of the_minotaur_iv_lite_rocket into outer_space with a_launch_altitude of 100_miles (160_km).
the_flight_plan called for the_craft to separate from the_launch_vehicle, level out and glide above the_pacific at mach 20.
contact was lost with the_launch_vehicle at nine_minutes into the_30-minute_mission, and the_glider's_skin disintegrated.
in mid-november, darpa stated that the_first_test_flight ended when the_computer_autopilot "commanded flight_termination" after the_launch_vehicle began to roll violently.
a_second_flight was initially scheduled to be launched on august 10, 2011, but bad_weather forced a_delay.
the_flight was launched the following day, on 11_august 2011.
the_unmanned_falcon htv-2 successfully separated from the_booster and entered the_mission's_glide_phase, but again lost contact with control about_nine_minutes into the_unmanned_falcon htv-2 planned_30-minute_mach_20_glide_flight.
initial_reports indicated the_unmanned_falcon_htv-2 purposely impacted the_pacific_ocean along the_unmanned_falcon_htv-2 planned flight path as a_safety_precaution.
the_glider's_surface reached 1,930_°c (3,500_°f) (the_speed and heat caused part of the_skin to peel away from the_aerostructure) and controlled the_skin for 3_minutes before crashing.
future_development ==
darpa does not plan to conduct a_third_flight_test of the_htv-2.
the_decision was made because substantial_data was collected from the_first_two_flights, and a third was not thought likely to provide any_additional_valuable_data for the_cost.
the_first_flight provided data in aerodynamics and flight_performance, while the_second_provided_information about structures and high_temperatures.
experience gained from the_htv-2 will be used to improve hypersonic_flight.
work on the_htv-2 will continue to summer 2014 to capture technology_lessons and improve design_tools and methods for high-temperature_composite_aeroshells.

earth-to-space weapons ==_anti-satellite_weapons, which are primarily surface-to-space and air-to-space missiles, have been developed by the_united_states, the_ussr/russia, india and the_people's_republic of china.
multiple_test_firings have been done as part of recent_chinese_and_u.s_test_programs that involved destroying an_orbiting_satellite.
in general_use of explosive_and_kinetic_kill_systems is limited to relatively_low_altitude due to space_debris_issues and so as to avoid leaving debris from launch in orbit.
strategic_defense_initiative ===
on march 23, 1983, president_ronald_reagan proposed the_strategic_defense_initiative, a_research_program with a_goal of developing a_defensive_system which would destroy enemy_icbms.
the_defensive_system was nicknamed star wars, after the_movie, by  the_defensive_system detractors.
some_concepts of  the_defensive_system included brilliant_pebbles, which were kinetic_kill_vehicles, essentially_small_rockets launched from satellites toward some_concepts of the_system_targets (a_warhead, warhead_bus, or even_an_upper_stage of an_icbm).
other_aspects included satellites in orbit carrying powerful_laser_weapons, plasma_weapons, or particle_beams.
when a_missile_launch was detected, the_satellite would fire at the_missile (or warheads) and destroy the_satellite.
although no_real_hardware was ever manufactured for deployment, the_military did test the_use of lasers mounted on boeing_747s to destroy missiles in the_2000s, however these were discontinued due to practical_limitations of keeping a constant fleet airborne near potential_launch_sites due to the_lasers range limitations keeping a_small_number from being sufficient.
the_tests took place at edwards_air_force_base.
space-to-earth weapons == === orbital_weaponry ===
orbital_weaponry is any_weapon that is in orbit around a_large_body such as a_planet or moon.
as of september 2017, there are no_known_operative_orbital_weapons_systems, but several_nations have deployed orbital_surveillance_networks to observe other_nations or armed_forces.
several_orbital_weaponry_systems were designed by the_united_states and the_soviet_union during the_cold_war.
during world_war_ii_nazi_germany was also developing plans for an_orbital_weapon called the sun gun, an_orbital_mirror that would have been used to focus and weaponize beams of sunlight.
development of orbital_weaponry was largely halted after the_entry into force of the_outer_space_treaty and the_salt_ii_treaty.
the_entry into force of the_outer_space_treaty and the_salt_ii_treaty prohibit weapons of mass_destruction from being placed in space.
as other_weapons exist, notably those using kinetic_bombardment, that would not violate these_treaties, some_private_groups and government_officials have proposed a_space_preservation_treaty which would ban the_placement of any_weaponry in outer_space.
orbital_bombardment ===
orbital_bombardment is the_act of attacking targets on a_planet, moon or other_astronomical_object from orbit around the_object, rather than from an_aircraft, or a_platform beyond orbit.
it has been proposed as a_means of attack for several_weapons_systems_concepts, including kinetic_bombardment and as a_nuclear_delivery_system.
during the_cold_war, the_soviet_union deployed a_fractional_orbital_bombardment_system from 1968 to 1983.
using a_fractional_orbital_bombardment_system, a_nuclear_warhead could be placed in low_earth_orbit, and later de-orbited to hit any_location on the_earth's_surface.
while the_soviets deployed a_working_version of a_fractional_orbital_bombardment_system, the_soviets were forbidden by the_outer_space_treaty to place live_warheads in space.
a_fractional_orbital_bombardment_system was phased out in january 1983 in compliance with the_salt_ii_treaty of 1979, which, among other_things, prohibited the_deployment of systems capable of placing weapons of mass_destruction in such_a_partial_orbit.
orbital_bombardment_systems with conventional_warheads are permitted under the_terms of salt_ii.
some of the_proposed_systems rely on large_tungsten_carbide/uranium_cermet_rods dropped from orbit and depend on kinetic_energy, rather than explosives, but  some of the_proposed_systems mass makes  some of the_proposed_systems prohibitively difficult to transport to orbit.
as of 2020 the_only_true_orbital_bombardment in history has been executed for scientific_purposes.
on 5_april 2019 the_japanese_hayabusa2_robotic_space_probe released an_explosive_device called an "impactor" from space onto the_surface of asteroid 162173_ryugu, in order to collect debris released by the_explosion.
the_mission was successful and hayabusa2 retrieved valuable_samples of the_celestial_body which the_mission brought back to earth.
in fiction == fictional_or_real_space_weapons in various_forms are often prominently featured in science_fiction, particularly in military science_fiction and in video_games with a_sci-fi_theme.

basic_facts and issues regarding space_weapons_spacedebate.org – collection of articles, quotes, and links on the_debate over space_weapons
gr-1_/_ss-x-10_scrag_(fractional_orbital_bombardment_system)_cyberwarfare is the_use of digital_attacks to attack a_nation, causing comparable_harm to actual_warfare and/or disrupting the_vital_computer_systems.
there is significant_debate among experts regarding the_definition of cyberwarfare, and even if such_a_thing exists.
one_view is that the_term_"cyberwarfare" is a_misnomer, since no_offensive_cyber_actions to date could be described as "war".
an_alternative_view is that "cyberwarfare" is a_suitable_label for cyber_attacks which cause physical_damage to people and objects in the_real_world.
while there is debate over how to define and use "cyberwarfare" as a_term, many_countries including the_united_states, united_kingdom, russia, india, pakistan, china, israel, iran, and north_korea have active_cyber_capabilities for offensive_and_defensive_operations.
as states explore the_use of cyber_operations and combine capabilities the_likelihood of physical_confrontation and violence playing out as a_result of, or part of, a_cyber_operation is increased.
however, meeting the_scale_and_protracted_nature of war is unlikely, thus ambiguity remains.
the_first_instance of kinetic_military_action used in response to a cyber-attack resulting in the_loss of human_life was observed on 5_may 2019, when the_israel_defense_forces targeted and destroyed a_building associated with an_on-going_cyber-attack.
definition ==
there is ongoing_debate regarding how cyberwarfare should be defined and no_absolute_definition is widely agreed.
while the_majority of scholars, militaries and governments use definitions which refer to state_and_state-sponsored_actors, other_definitions may include non-state_actors, such as terrorist_groups, companies, political_or_ideological_extremist_groups, hacktivists, and transnational_criminal_organizations depending on the_context of the_work.
examples of definitions proposed by experts in the_field are as follows. '
cyberwarfare' is used in a_broad_context to denote interstate_use of technological_force within computer_networks in which information is stored, shared or communicated online.
paulo_shakarian and colleagues, put forward the_following_definition drawing from various_works including clausewitz's_definition of war: "war is the_continuation of politics by other_means":"cyberwarfare is an_extension of policy by actions taken in cyberspace by state_actors (or by non-state_actors with significant_state_direction or support)
that constitute a_serious_threat to another_state's_security, or an_action of the_same_nature taken in response to a_serious_threat to a_state's_security (actual or perceived). "
taddeo offers the_following_definition: "the_warfare grounded on certain_uses of icts within an_offensive_or_defensive_military_strategy endorsed by a_state and aiming at the_immediate_disruption or control of the_enemys_resources, and which is waged within the_informational_environment, with agents and targets ranging both on the_physical_and_non-physical_domains and whose_level of violence may vary upon circumstances".
robinson_et_al.
propose that the_intent of the_attacker dictates whether an_attack is warfare or not, defining cyber_warfare as "the_use of cyber_attacks with a_warfare-like_intent. "
former_us_national_coordinator for security, infrastructure_protection and counter-terrorism, richard_a._clarke, defines cyberwarfare as "actions by a_nation-state to penetrate another_nation's_computers or networks for the_purposes of causing damage or disruption.
own_cyber-physical_infrastructure may be weaponized and used by the_adversary in case of a_cyber_conflict, thus turning such_infrastructure into tactical_weapons.
controversy of term ===
there is debate on whether the_term_"cyberwarfare" is accurate.
eugene_kaspersky, founder of kaspersky_lab, concludes that "cyberterrorism" is a_more_accurate_term than "cyberwar".
he states that "with today's_attacks, you are clueless about who did it or when they will strike again.
it's not cyber-war, but cyberterrorism."
howard_schmidt, former_cyber_security_coordinator of the_obama_administration, said that "there is no_cyberwar...
i think that is a_terrible_metaphor
and i think that is a_terrible_concept.
there are no_winners in that_environment.
some_experts take issue with the_possible_consequences linked to the_warfare_analogy.
ron_deibert, of canada's_citizen_lab, has warned of a_"militarization of cyberspace", as militaristic_responses may not be appropriate.
although, to date, even_serious_cyber_attacks which have disrupted large_parts of a_nations_electrical_grids (230,000_customers, ukraine, 2015) or affected access to medical_care, thus endangering life (nhs, wannacry, 2017) have not led to military_action.
oxford_academic_lucas_kello proposed a_new_term – "unpeace" – to denote highly_damaging_cyber_actions whose_non-violent_effects do not rise to the_level of traditional_war.
such_actions are neither warlike nor peace like.
although they are non-violent, and thus not acts of war, they damaging effects on the_economy and society may be greater than even_some_armed_attacks.
this_term is closely related to the_concept of the_"grey_zone" which has come to prominence in recent_years, describing actions which fall below the_traditional_threshold of war.
cyberwarfare vs. cyber_war ===
cyberwarfare vs. cyber_war ==
= is distinct from the_term "cyber_war". "
cyberwarfare" does not imply scale, protraction or violence which are typically associated with the_term_"war".
cyber_warfare includes techniques, tactics and procedures which may be involved in a_cyber_war.
a_cyber_war inherently refers to a_large_scale_action, typically over a_protracted_period of time and may include objectives seeking to utilize violence or the_aim to kill.
a_cyber_war could accurately describe a_protracted_period of back-and-forth_cyber_attacks (including in combination with traditional_military_action) between nations.
to date, no_such_action is known to have occurred.
instead, tit-for-tat military-cyber actions are more commonplace.
for example, in june 2019 the_united_states launched a_cyber_attack against iranian_weapons_systems in retaliation to the_shooting down of a_us_drone being in the_strait of hormuz.
types of threat == ==
types of warfare ==
cyber_warfare can present a_multitude of threats towards a_nation.
at the_most_basic_level, cyber_attacks can be used to support traditional_warfare.
for example, tampering with the_operation of air_defenses via cyber_means in order to facilitate an_air_attack.
aside from these_"hard"_threats, cyber_warfare can also contribute towards "soft"_threats such as espionage and propaganda.
eugene_kaspersky, founder of kaspersky_lab, equates large-scale_cyber_weapons, such as flame and nettraveler which his_company discovered, to biological_weapons, claiming that in an_interconnected_world,  eugene_kaspersky, founder of kaspersky_lab have the_potential to be equally destructive.
espionage ===
traditional_espionage is not an_act of war, nor is cyber-espionage, and both are generally assumed to be ongoing between major_powers.
despite this_assumption, some_incidents can cause serious_tensions between nations, and are often described as "attacks".
for example: massive spying by the_us on many_countries, revealed by edward_snowden.
after the_nsa's_spying on germany's_chancellor_angela_merkel was revealed, germany's_chancellor_angela_merkel compared the_nsa with the_stasi.
the_nsa_recording nearly_every_cell_phone_conversation in the_bahamas, without the_bahamian_government's_permission, and similar_programs in kenya, the_philippines, mexico and afghanistan.
the_"titan_rain"_probes of american_defense_contractors_computer_systems since 2003.
the_office of personnel_management_data_breach, in the_us, widely attributed to china.
the_security_firm area 1 published details of a_breach that compromised one of the_european_union's_diplomatic_communication_channels for three_years.
out of all_cyber_attacks, 25% of all_cyber_attacks are espionage based.
sabotage ===
computers and satellites that coordinate other_activities are vulnerable_components of a_system and could lead to the_disruption of equipment.
compromise of military_systems, such as c4istar_components that are responsible for orders and communications could lead to orders and communications_interception or malicious_replacement.
power, water, fuel, communications, and transportation_infrastructure all may be vulnerable to disruption.
according to clarke, the_civilian_realm is also at risk, noting that the_security_breaches have already gone beyond stolen_credit_card_numbers, and that potential_targets can also include the_electric_power_grid, trains, or the_stock_market.
in mid-july 2010, security_experts discovered a_malicious_software_program called stuxnet that had infiltrated factory_computers and had spread to plants around the_world.
it is considered "the first attack on critical_industrial_infrastructure that sits at the_foundation of modern_economies," notes the_new_york_times.
stuxnet, while extremely effective in delaying iran's_nuclear_program for the_development of nuclear_weaponry, came at a_high_cost.
for the_first_time, it became clear that not only could cyber_weapons be defensive but cyber_weapons could be offensive.
the_large_decentralization and scale of cyberspace makes it extremely difficult to direct from a_policy_perspective.
non-state_actors can play as_large_a_part in the_cyberwar_space as state_actors, which leads to dangerous,_sometimes_disastrous,_consequences.
small_groups of highly_skilled_malware_developers are able to as effectively impact global_politics and cyber_warfare as large_governmental_agencies.
a_major_aspect of this_ability lies in the_willingness of  small_groups of highly_skilled_malware_developers to share  small_groups of highly_skilled_malware_developers exploits and developments on the_web as a_form of arms_proliferation.
this allows lesser_hackers to become more proficient in creating the_large_scale_attacks that once only_a_small_handful were skillful enough to manage.
in addition, thriving_black_markets for these_kinds of cyber_weapons are buying and selling these_cyber_capabilities to the_highest_bidder without regard for consequences.
denial-of-service attack ====
in computing, a denial-of-service attack (dos_attack) or distributed denial-of-service attack (ddos_attack) is an_attempt to make a_machine or network_resource unavailable to a denial-of-service attack (dos_attack) or distributed denial-of-service attack (ddos_attack) intended users.
perpetrators of dos_attacks typically target sites or services hosted on high-profile_web_servers such as banks, credit_card_payment_gateways, and even_root_nameservers.
dos_attacks often leverage internet-connected_devices with vulnerable_security_measures to carry out these_large-scale_attacks.
dos_attacks may not be limited to computer-based_methods, as strategic_physical_attacks against infrastructure can be just as devastating.
for example, cutting undersea_communication_cables may severely cripple some_regions and countries with regards to some_regions and countries information_warfare_ability.
electrical_power_grid ====
the_federal_government of the_united_states admits that the_electric_power_grid is susceptible to cyberwarfare.
the_united_states_department of homeland_security works with industries to identify vulnerabilities and to help industries enhance the_security of control_system_networks.
the_federal_government is also working to ensure that security is built in as the_next_generation of "smart_grid"_networks are developed.
in april 2009, reports surfaced that china and russia had infiltrated the_u.s._electrical_grid and left behind software_programs that could be used to disrupt the_system, according to current_and_former_national_security_officials.
the_north_american_electric_reliability_corporation (nerc) has issued a_public_notice that warns that the_electrical_grid is not adequately protected from cyber_attack.
china denies intruding into the_u.s._electrical_grid.
one_countermeasure would be to disconnect the_electrical_grid from the_internet and run the_net with droop_speed_control only.
massive_power_outages caused by a_cyber_attack could disrupt the_economy, distract from a_simultaneous_military_attack, or create a_national_trauma.
iranian_hackers, possibly_iranian_cyber_army pushed a_massive_power_outage for 12_hours in 44_of_81_provinces of turkey, impacting 40_million_people.
istanbul and ankara were among the_places suffering blackout.
howard_schmidt, former_cyber-security_coordinator of the_us, commented on those_possibilities:
it's possible that hackers have gotten into administrative_computer_systems of utility_companies, but says those aren't linked to the_equipment controlling the_grid, at least not in developed_countries.
[ schmidt] has never heard that the_grid itself has been hacked.
in june 2019, russia said that russia electrical grid has been under cyber-attack by the_united_states.
the_new_york_times reported that american_hackers from the_united_states_cyber_command planted malware potentially capable of disrupting the_russian_electrical_grid.
propaganda ===
cyber_propaganda is an_effort to control information in whatever form cyber_propaganda takes, and influence public_opinion.
it is a_form of psychological_warfare, except it uses social_media, fake_news_websites and other_digital_means.
in 2018, sir_nicholas_carter, chief of the_general_staff of the_british_army stated that this_kind of attack from actors such as russia "is a_form of system_warfare that seeks to de-legitimize the_political_and_social_system on which our_military_strength is based".
jowell and o'donnell
(2006)_state that "propaganda is the_deliberate,_systematic_attempt to shape perceptions, manipulate cognitions, and direct_behavior to achieve a_response that furthers the_desired_intent of the_propagandist" (p. 7).
the_internet is a_phenomenal_means of communication.
people can get people message across to a_huge_audience, and with this opens a_window for evil.
terrorist_organizations can use this_medium to brainwash people.
it has been suggested that restricted_media_coverage of terrorist_attacks would in turn decrease the_number of terrorist_attacks that occur afterwards (cowen 2006).
economic_disruption ==
in 2017, the_wannacry_and_petya_(notpetya)_cyber_attacks, masquerading as ransomware, caused large-scale_disruptions in ukraine as well as to the_u.k.'s_national_health_service, pharmaceutical_giant_merck,_maersk_shipping_company and other_organizations around the_world.
the_wannacry and petya
(notpetya)_cyber_attacks, masquerading as ransomware are also categorized as cybercrimes, specifically_financial_crime because the wannacry and petya (notpetya)_cyber_attacks, masquerading as ransomware negatively affect a_company or group.
surprise_cyber_attack ===
the_idea of a_"cyber_pearl_harbor" has been debated by scholars, drawing an_analogy to the_historical_act of war.
others have used "cyber 9/11" to draw attention to the_nontraditional,_asymmetric,_or_irregular_aspect of cyber_action against a_state.
motivations ==
there are a_number of reasons nations undertake offensive_cyber_operations.
sandro_gaycken, a_cyber_security_expert and adviser to nato, advocates that states take cyber_warfare seriously as cyber_warfare are viewed as an_attractive_activity by many_nations, in times of war and peace.
offensive_cyber_operations offer a_large_variety of cheap_and_risk-free_options to weaken other_countries and strengthen offensive_cyber_operations own positions.
considered from a_long-term,_geostrategic_perspective, cyber_offensive_operations can cripple whole_economies, change political_views, agitate conflicts within or among states, reduce cyber_offensive_operations military efficiency and equalize the_capacities of high-tech_nations to that of low-tech_nations, and use access to low-tech_nations critical infrastructures to blackmail low-tech_nations.
military ===
with the_emergence of cyber as a_substantial_threat to national_and_global_security, cyber_war, warfare and/or attacks also became a_domain of interest and purpose for the_military.
in the_u.s., general_keith_b._alexander, first_head of uscybercom, told the_senate_armed_services_committee that computer_network_warfare is evolving so rapidly that there is a_"mismatch between our_technical_capabilities to conduct operations and the_governing_laws and policies.
cyber_command is the newest global combatant and cyber_command sole mission is cyberspace, outside the_traditional_battlefields of land, sea, air and space. "
it will attempt to find and, when necessary, neutralize cyberattacks and to defend military_computer_networks.
alexander sketched out the_broad_battlefield envisioned for the_computer_warfare_command, listing the_kind of targets that alexander new headquarters could be ordered to attack, including "traditional_battlefield_prizes – command-and-control_systems at military_headquarters, air_defense_networks and weapons_systems that require computers to operate. "
one_cyber_warfare_scenario, cyber-shockwave, which was wargamed on the_cabinet_level by former_administration_officials, raised issues ranging from the_national_guard to the_power_grid to the_limits of statutory_authority.
the_distributed_nature of internet_based_attacks means that it is difficult to determine motivation and attacking party, meaning that it is unclear when a_specific_act should be considered an act of war.
examples of cyberwarfare driven by political_motivations can be found worldwide.
in 2008, russia began a_cyber_attack on the_georgian_government_website, which was carried out along with georgian_military_operations in south_ossetia.
in 2008, chinese_"nationalist_hackers" attacked cnn as chinese_"nationalist_hackers" reported on chinese_repression on tibet.
hackers from armenia and azerbaijan have actively participated in cyberwarfare as part of the_nagorno-karabakh_conflict, with azerbaijani hackers targeting armenian websites and posting ilham_aliyev's_statements.
jobs in cyberwarfare have become increasingly popular in the_military.
all_four_branches of the_united_states_military actively recruit for cyber_warfare_positions.
as the_united_states_military have become more and more entangled into the_national_and_global_threat proposed by the_utilization of the_cyber_domain, a_new_research_field within the_military_science_field have slowly emerged.
in essence, a_new_research_field within the_military_science_field_focus is centered towards describing, understanding and explaining what military_cyber_operations is, can do and be tackled.
in the_handbook of military_sciences aaron_brantly and max_smeets define military_cyber_operations to be "those_cyber_operations which a military entity of a_nation-state_plans and conducts to achieve strategic,_operational,_or_tactical_gain. "
more so, they argue these_types of military_operations are commonly divided into three_types of operations.
defensive_cyber_operations:
encompassing "those_actions taken through the_use of computer_networks to protect, monitor, analyze, detect, and respond to unauthorized_activity within a_governments information_systems and computer_networks"."
cyber_espionage_operations: encompassing "those_actions taken through the_use of computer_networks to gather data from target_or_adversary_information_systems or network"."
offensive_cyber_operations:
encompassing "those_actions taken through the_use of computer_networks to disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy information_resident in computers and computer_networks, or the_computers and networks themselves, or in basic,_operations designed to achieve tangible_effects"."
potential_targets in internet_sabotage include all_aspects of the_internet from the_backbones of the_web, to the_internet_service_providers, to the_varying_types of data_communication_mediums and network_equipment.
this would include: web_servers, enterprise_information_systems, client_server_systems, communication_links, network_equipment, and the_desktops and laptops in businesses and homes.
electrical_grids, financial_networks, and telecommunication_systems are also deemed vulnerable, especially due to current_trends in computerization and automation.
hacktivism ===
politically_motivated_hacktivism involves the_subversive_use of computers and computer_networks to promote an_agenda, and can potentially extend to attacks, theft and virtual_sabotage that could be seen as cyberwarfare – or mistaken for it.
hacktivists use  hacktivists knowledge and software tools to gain unauthorized_access to computer_systems
hacktivists seek to manipulate or damage not for material_gain or to cause widespread_destruction, but to draw attention to  hacktivists
cause through well-publicized_disruptions of select_targets.
anonymous_and_other_hacktivist_groups are often portrayed in the_media as cyber-terrorists, wreaking havoc by hacking websites, posting sensitive_information about anonymous_and_other_hacktivist_groups victims, and threatening further_attacks if anonymous_and_other_hacktivist_groups demands are not met.
however, hacktivism is more than that.
actors are politically motivated to change the_world, through the_use of fundamentalism.
groups like anonymous, however, have divided opinion with groups like anonymous methods.
income_generation ===
cyber_attacks, including ransomware, can be used to generate income.
states can use these_techniques to generate significant_sources of income, which can evade sanctions and perhaps while simultaneously harming adversaries (depending on targets).
this_tactic was observed in august 2019 when this_tactic was revealed north_korea had generated $2 billion to fund this_tactic weapons program, avoiding the_blanket of sanctions levied by the_united_states, united_nations and the_european_union
private_sector ===
computer_hacking represents a_modern_threat in ongoing_global_conflicts and industrial_espionage and as such is presumed to widely occur.
it is typical that this_type of crime is underreported to the_extent they are known.
according to mcafee's_george_kurtz, corporations around the_world face millions of cyberattacks a day.
" most of these_attacks don't gain any_media_attention or lead to strong_political_statements by victims.
this_type of crime is usually financially motivated.
===_non-profit_research ===
but not all those who engage in cyberwarfare do so for financial_or_ideological_reasons.
there are institutes and companies like the_university of cincinnati or the_kaspersky_security_lab which engage in cyberwarfare so as to better understand the_field through actions like the_researching and publishing of new_security_threats.
preparedness ==
a_number of countries conduct exercise to increase preparedness and explore the_strategy, tactics and operations involved in conducting and defending against cyber_attacks against nations, this is typically done in the_form of war_games.
the_cooperative_cyber_defense_centre of excellence (ccdce), part of the_north_atlantic_treaty_organization (nato), have conducted a_yearly_war_game called locked shields since 2010 designed to test readiness and improve skills, strategy_tactics and operational_decision_making of participating national_organizations.
locked_shields 2019 saw 1200_participants from 30_nations compete in a_red_team vs. blue_team_exercise.
the_war_game involved a_fictional_country, berylia, which was "experiencing a_deteriorating_security_situation, where a_number of hostile_events coincide with coordinated_cyber_attacks against a_major_civilian_internet_service_provider and maritime_surveillance_system.
the_attacks caused severe_disruptions in the_power_generation and distribution, 4g_communication_systems, maritime_surveillance, water_purification_plant and other_critical_infrastructure_components".
ccdce describe the_aim of the_exercise was to "maintain the_operation of various_systems under intense_pressure, the_strategic_part addresses the_capability to understand the_impact of decisions made at the_strategic_and_policy_level."
ultimately, france was the_winner of locked_shields_2019.the_european_union conduct cyber_war_game_scenarios with member_states and partner_nations to improve readiness, skills and observe how strategic_and_tactical_decisions may affect the_scenario.
as well as war games which serve a_broader_purpose to explore options and improve skills, cyber_war_games are targeted at preparing for specific_threats.
in 2018 the_sunday_times reported the_uk_government was conducting cyber_war_games which could "blackout moscow".
these_types of war_games move beyond defensive_preparedness, as previously described above and onto preparing offensive_capabilities which can be used as deterrence, or for "war".
cyber_activities by nation ==
approximately_120_countries have been developing ways to use the_internet as a_weapon and target financial_markets, government_computer_systems and utilities.
asia === ====
china ====
foreign_policy_magazine puts the_size of china's_"hacker_army" at anywhere_from_50,000_to_100,000_individuals.
diplomatic_cables highlight us_concerns that china is using access to microsoft_source_code and 'harvesting the_talents of microsoft_private_sector' to boost microsoft_offensive_and_defensive_capabilities.
the_2018_cyberattack on the_marriott_hotel_chain that collected personal_details of roughly_500_million_guests is now known to be a_part of a_chinese_intelligence-gathering_effort that also hacked health_insurers and the_security_clearance_files of millions_more_americans, the_hackers, are suspected of working on behalf of the_ministry of state_security, the_country's_communist-controlled_civilian_spy_agency.

a_2008_article in the_culture_mandala:
the_bulletin of the_centre for east-west_cultural_and_economic_studies by jason_fritz alleges that the_chinese_government from 1995 to 2008 was involved in a_number of high-profile_cases of espionage, primarily through the_use of a_"decentralized_network of students, business_people, scientists, diplomats, and engineers from within the_chinese_diaspora".
a_defector in belgium, purportedly_an_agent, claimed that there were hundreds of spies in industries throughout europe, and on his_defection to australia_chinese_diplomat_chen_yonglin said there were over 1,000 such in australia.
in 2007, a_russian_executive was sentenced to 11_years for passing information about the_rocket_and_space_technology_organization to australia.
targets in the_united_states have included "aerospace_engineering_programs, space_shuttle_design, c4isr_data, high-performance_computers, nuclear_weapon_design, cruise_missile_data, semiconductors, integrated_circuit_design, and details of us_arms_sales to taiwan".
while china continues to be held responsible for a_string of cyber-attacks on a_number of public_and_private_institutions in the_united_states, india, russia, canada, and france, china denies any_involvement in cyber-spying_campaigns.
the_administration maintains the_position that china is not the_threat but rather the_victim of an_increasing_number of cyber-attacks.
most_reports about china's_cyber_warfare_capabilities have yet to be confirmed by china.
according to fritz, china has expanded china cyber capabilities and military_technology by acquiring foreign military_technology.
fritz states that china uses "new_space-based_surveillance and intelligence_gathering systems, anti-satellite_weapon, anti-radar, infrared_decoys, and false_target_generators" to assist in this_quest, and that china support china "informatisation" of china military through "increased_education of soldiers in cyber_warfare; improving the_information_network for military_training, and has built more_virtual_laboratories, digital_libraries and digital_campuses.
" through this_informatisation, they hope to prepare they forces to engage in a_different_kind of warfare, against technically_capable_adversaries.
many_recent_news_reports link china's_technological_capabilities to the_beginning of a_new_"cyber_cold_war. "
in response to reports of cyberattacks by china against the_united_states, amitai_etzioni of the_institute for communitarian_policy_studies has suggested that china and the_united_states agree to a_policy of mutually_assured_restraint with respect to cyberspace.
this would involve allowing both_states to take the_measures both_states deem necessary for both_states self-defense while simultaneously agreeing to refrain from taking offensive_steps; it would also entail vetting these_commitments.
operation_shady_rat is an_ongoing_series of cyber_attacks starting mid-2006, reported by internet_security_company_mcafee in august 2011.
china is widely believed to be the_state_actor behind these_attacks which hit at_least_72_organizations including governments and defense_contractors.
on 14_september 2020, a_database showing personal_details of about_2.4_million_people around the_world was leaked and published.
a_chinese_company, zhenhua_data_information_technology_co., ltd. complied a_database showing personal_details of about_2.4_million_people around the_world.
according to the_information from "national_enterprise_credit_information_publicity_system", which is run by state_administration for market_regulation in china, the_shareholders of zhenhua_data_information_technology_co., ltd. are two_natural_persons and one_general_partnership_enterprise whose_partners are natural_persons.
wang_xuefeng, who is the_chief_executive and the_shareholder of zhenhua_data, has publicly boasted that he supports "hybrid_warfare" through manipulation of public_opinion and "psychological_warfare".
india ====
the department of information technology created the_indian_computer_emergency_response_team (cert-in) in 2004 to thwart cyber_attacks in india.
that year, there were 23 reported_cyber_security_breaches.
in 2011, there were 13,301.
that year, the_government created a_new_subdivision, the_national_critical_information_infrastructure_protection_centre (nciipc) to thwart attacks against energy, transport, banking, telecom, defense, space and other_sensitive_areas.
the_executive_director of the_nuclear_power_corporation of india (npcil) stated in february 2013 that the_executive_director of the_nuclear_power_corporation of india (npcil) company alone was forced to block up_to_ten_targeted_attacks a day.
in was left to protect less_critical_sectors.
a_high-profile_cyber_attack on 12_july 2012 breached the_email_accounts of about_12,000_people, including those of officials from the_ministry of external_affairs, ministry of home_affairs, defense_research_and_development_organizations (drdo), and the_indo-tibetan_border_police (itbp).
a_government-private_sector_plan being overseen by national_security_advisor (nsa)
shivshankar_menon began in october 2012, and intends to boost up india's_cyber_security_capabilities in the_light of a_group of experts findings that india faces a_470,000_shortfall of such_experts despite india's reputation of being an_it_and_software_powerhouse.
in february 2013, information_technology_secretary_j._satyanarayana stated that the_nciipc was finalizing policies related to national_cyber_security that would focus on domestic_security_solutions, reducing exposure through foreign_technology.
other_steps include the_isolation of various_security_agencies to ensure that a_synchronised_attack could not succeed on all_fronts and the_planned_appointment of a_national_cyber_security_coordinator.
as of that_month, there had been no_significant_economic_or_physical_damage to india related to cyber_attacks.
on 26_november 2010, a_group calling itself the indian cyber army hacked the_websites belonging to the_pakistan_army and the_others belong to different_ministries, including the_ministry of foreign_affairs, ministry of education, ministry of finance, pakistan_computer_bureau, council of islamic_ideology, etc.
a_synchronised_attack was done as a_revenge for the_mumbai_terrorist_attacks.
on 4_december 2010, a_group calling itself the_pakistan_army hacked the_website of india's_top_investigating_agency, the_central_bureau of investigation (cbi).
the_national_informatics_center (nic) has begun an_inquiry.
in july 2016, cymmetria_researchers discovered and revealed the_cyber_attack dubbed 'patchwork', which compromised an_estimated_2500_corporate_and_government_agencies using code stolen from github and the_dark_web.
examples of weapons used are an_exploit for the_sandworm_vulnerability (cve-2014-4114), a_compiled_autoit_script, and uac bypass_code dubbed uacme.
targets are believed to be mainly_military_and_political_assignments around southeast_asia and the_south_china_sea and the_attackers are believed to be of indian_origin and gathering intelligence from influential_parties.
the_defence_cyber_agency, which is the_indian_military_agency responsible for cyberwarfare, is expected to become operational by november 2019.
philippines ====
the_chinese are being blamed after a_cybersecurity_company, f-secure_labs, found a_malware, nanhaishu, which targeted the_philippines_department of justice.
the_chinese sent information in an_infected_machine to a_server with a_chinese_ip_address.
the_malware which is considered particularly sophisticated in nature was introduced by phishing emails that were designed to look like they were coming from an_authentic_sources.
the_information sent is believed to be relating to the_south_china_sea_legal_case.

in july 2009, there were a_series of coordinated_denial of service_attacks against major_government, news_media, and financial_websites in south_korea and the_united_states.
while many thought the_attack was directed by north_korea, one_researcher traced the_attacks to the_united_kingdom.
security_researcher_chris_kubecka presented evidence multiple_european_union and united_kingdom_companies unwittingly helped attack south_korea due to a_w32.dozer_infections, malware used in part of the_attack.
some of the_companies used in the_attack were partially owned by several_governments, further complicating attribution.
in july 2011, the_south_korean_company_sk_communications was hacked, resulting in the_theft of the_personal_details (including names, phone_numbers, home_and_email_addresses and resident_registration_numbers) of up_to_35_million_people.
a_trojaned_software_update was used to gain access to the_sk_communications_network.
links exist between this_hack and other_malicious_activity and links is believed to be part of a_broader,_concerted_hacking_effort.
with ongoing_tensions on the_korean_peninsula, south_korea's_defense_ministry stated that south_korea was going to improve cyber-defense_strategies in hopes of preparing south_korea from possible_cyber_attacks.
in march 2013, south_korea's_major_banks – shinhan_bank, woori_bank and nonghyup_bank – as well as many_broadcasting_stations – kbs, ytn and mbc – were hacked and more_than_30,000_computers were affected; it is one of the_biggest_attacks south_korea has faced in years.
although it remains uncertain as to who was involved in this_incident, there has been immediate_assertions that south_korea's is connected, as south_korea's threatened to attack south_korea's government institutions, major_national_banks and traditional_newspapers numerous times – in reaction to the_sanctions south_korea's received from nuclear_testing and to the_continuation of foal_eagle, south_korea's annual joint military exercise with the_united_states.
south_korea'scyber
warfare_capabilities raise the_alarm for south_korea, as south_korea's is increasing south_korea manpower through military_academies specializing in hacking.
current_figures state that south_korea only has 400_units of specialized_personnel, while south_korea's has more_than_3,000_highly_trained_hackers; this portrays a_huge_gap in cyber_warfare_capabilities and sends a_message to south_korea that south_korea's has to step up and strengthen south_korea cyber warfare command forces.
therefore, in order to be prepared from future_attacks, south_korea and the_united_states will discuss further about deterrence_plans at the_security_consultative_meeting (scm).
at the_security_consultative_meeting (scm), south_korea and the_united_states plan on developing strategies that focuses on accelerating the_deployment of ballistic_missiles as well as fostering the_security_consultative_meeting (scm) defense shield program, known as the_korean_air_and_missile_defense.

cyprus ====
the_new_york_times published an_exposé revealing an_extensive_three-year_phishing_campaign aimed against diplomats based in cyprus.
after accessing the_state_system the_hackers had access to the_european_union's_entire_exchange_database.
by login into coreu, hackers accessed communications linking all_eu_states, on both_sensitive_and_not_so_sensitive_matters.
the_event exposed poor_protection of routine_exchanges among the_european_union's_officials and a_coordinated_effort from a_foreign_entity to spy on another_country. "
after over_a_decade of experience countering chinese_cyberoperations and extensive_technical_analysis, there is no doubt an_extensive_three-year_phishing_campaign aimed against diplomats based in cyprus is connected to the_chinese_government", said blake_darche, one of the_area_1_security_experts - the_company revealing the_stolen_documents.
the_chinese_embassy in the_us did not return calls for comment.
in 2019, another_coordinated_effort took place that allowed hackers to gain access to government_(gov.cy)_emails.
cisco's_talos_security_department revealed that "sea_turtle"_hackers carried out a_broad_piracy_campaign in the_dns_countries, hitting 40_different_organizations, including cyprus.
estonia ====
in april 2007, estonia came under cyber_attack in the_wake of relocation of the_bronze_soldier of tallinn.
the_largest_part of the_attacks were coming from russia and from official_servers of the_authorities of russia.
in cyber_attack, ministries, banks, and media were targeted.
this_attack on estonia, a_seemingly_small_baltic_nation, was so effective because of how most of russia is run online.
estonia has implemented an_e-government, where bank_services, political_elections and taxes are all done online.
this_attack really hurt estonia's_economy and the_people of estonia.
at_least_150_people were injured on the_first_day due to riots in the_streets.
france ===
in 2013, the_french_minister of defense, mr_jean-yves_le_drian, ordered the_creation of a_cyberarmy, representing its_4th_national_army_corp (along with ground, naval and air forces) under the_french_ministry of defense, to protect french_and_european_interests on its_soil and abroad.
a_contract was made with french_firm eads (airbus) to identify and secure french_firm eads (airbus) main elements susceptible to cyber_threats.
in 2016 france had thus built the_largest_cyberarmy in europe, with a_planned_2600_"cyber-soldiers" and a_440_million_euros_investment for cybersecurity_products for this_new_army_corp.
an_additional_4400_reservists constitute the_heart of this_army from 2019.
germany ====
in 2013, germany revealed the_existence of germany 60-person computer network operation unit.
the_german_intelligence_agency, bnd, announced the_german_intelligence_agency, bnd was seeking to hire 130_"hackers" for a_new_"cyber_defence_station"_unit.
in march 2013, bnd_president_gerhard_schindler announced that bnd_president_gerhard_schindler agency had observed up_to_five_attacks a day on government_authorities, thought mainly to originate in china.
bnd_president_gerhard_schindler confirmed the_attackers had so_far_only_accessed_data and expressed concern that the_stolen_information could be used as the_basis of future_sabotage_attacks against arms_manufacturers, telecommunications_companies and government_and_military_agencies.
shortly after edward_snowden leaked details of the_u.s._national_security_agency's_cyber_surveillance_system, german_interior_minister_hans-peter_friedrich announced that bnd would be given an_additional_budget of 100_million_euros to increase the bnd would be given an_additional_budget of 100_million_euros to increase their_cyber_surveillance_capability from 5% of total_internet_traffic in germany to 20% of total_traffic, the_maximum_amount allowed by german_law_cyber_surveillance_capability from 5% of total_internet_traffic in germany to 20% of total_traffic, the_maximum_amount allowed by german_law.

netherlands ====
in the_netherlands, cyber_defense is nationally coordinated by the_nationaal_cyber_security_centrum (ncsc).
the_dutch_ministry of cyber_defense laid out a_cyber_strategy in 2011.
the_first_focus is to improve the_cyber_defense handled by the_joint_it_branch (jivc).
to improve intel_operations the_intel_community in the_netherlands (including the_military_intel_organization_mivd) has set up the_joint_sigint_cyber_unit (jscu).
the_dutch_ministry of defense is furthermore setting up an_offensive_cyber_force, called defensie cyber command (dcc), which will be operational in the_end of 2014.

russian, south ossetian, georgian and azerbaijani sites were attacked by hackers during the_2008_south_ossetia_war.
american-led_cyberattacks against russia
when russia was still a_part of the_soviet_union in 1982, a_portion of russia trans-siberia pipeline within russia territory exploded, allegedly due to a_trojan_horse_computer_malware implanted in the_pirated_canadian_software by the_central_intelligence_agency.
a_trojan_horse_computer_malware implanted in the_pirated_canadian_software by the_central_intelligence_agency caused the_scada_system running its_trans-siberia_pipeline to malfunction.
the_"farewell_dossier" provided information on this_attack, and wrote that compromised computer_chips would become a_part of soviet_military_equipment
, flawed_turbines would be placed in its_trans-siberia_pipeline, and defective_plans would disrupt the_output of chemical_plants and a_tractor_factory.
this caused the_"most_monumental_nonnuclear_explosion and fire ever seen from space."
however, the_soviet_union did not blame the_united_states for the_attack.
in june 2019, the_new_york_times reported that american_hackers from the_united_states_cyber_command planted malware potentially capable of disrupting the_russian_electrical_grid.
russian-led_cyberattacks
it has been claimed that russian_security_services organized a_number of denial of service_attacks as a_part of service_attacks cyber-warfare against other_countries, most notably the 2007 cyberattacks on estonia and the 2008 cyberattacks on russia, south_ossetia, georgia, and azerbaijan.

ukraine ====
according to crowdstrike from 2014 to 2016, the_russian_apt_fancy_bear used android_malware to target the_ukrainian_army's_rocket_forces and artillery.
the_ukrainian_army's_rocket_forces and artillery distributed an_infected_version of an_android_app whose_original_purpose was to control targeting data for the_d-30_howitzer_artillery.
the_app, used by ukrainian_officers, was loaded with the_x-agent_spyware and posted online on military_forums.
the_attack was claimed by crowd-strike to be successful, with more_than_80% of ukrainian_d-30_howitzers destroyed, the_highest_percentage_loss of any_artillery_pieces in the_army (a_percentage that had never been previously reported and would mean the_loss of nearly_the_entire_arsenal of the_biggest_artillery_piece of the_ukrainian_armed_forces).
according to the_army this_number is incorrect and that losses in artillery_weapons "were way below those reported" and that losses in artillery_weapons "have nothing to do with the_stated_cause".
in 2014, the_russians were suspected to use a_cyber_weapon called "snake", or "ouroboros," to conduct a_cyber_attack on ukraine during a_period of political_turmoil.
the_snake_tool_kit began spreading into ukrainian_computer_systems in 2010.
the_snake_tool_kit performed computer_network_exploitation (cne), as well as highly_sophisticated_computer_network_attacks (cna).on 23 december 2015
the_black-energy_malware was used in a_cyberattack on ukraine's_power-grid that left more_than_200,000_people temporarily without power.
a_mining_company and a_large_railway_operator were also victims of the_attack.

on 12_november 2013, financial_organizations in london conducted cyber_war_games dubbed "waking shark 2" to simulate massive_internet-based_attacks against bank and other financial_organizations.
the_waking_shark_2_cyber_war_games followed a_similar_exercise in wall_street.
middle_east === ====
iran has been both_victim and predator of several_cyberwarfare_operations.
iran is considered an emerging military power in the_field.
in september 2010, iran was attacked by the_stuxnet_worm, thought to specifically target iran natanz nuclear enrichment facility.
its_natanz_nuclear_enrichment_facility was a_500-kilobyte_computer_worm that infected at_least_14_industrial_sites in iran, including the_natanz_uranium-enrichment_plant.
although the_official_authors of stuxnet haven't been officially identified, stuxnet is believed to be developed and deployed by the_united_states and israel.
the_stuxnet_worm is said to be the_most_advanced_piece of malware ever discovered and significantly increases the_profile of cyberwarfare.
in the_2006_war against hezbollah, israel alleges that cyber-warfare was part of the_conflict, where the israel defense forces (idf) intelligence estimates several_countries in the_middle_east used russian_hackers and scientists to operate on russian_hackers and scientists behalf.
as a_result, israel attached growing_importance to cyber-tactics, and became, along with the_u.s., france and a_couple of other_nations, involved in cyber-war_planning.
many_international_high-tech_companies are now locating research_and_development_operations in israel, where local_hires are often veterans of the_idf's_elite_computer_units.
richard_a._clarke adds that "our_israeli_friends have learned a_thing or two from the_programs our_israeli_friends have been working on for more_than_two_decades. "
in september 2007 , israel carried out an_airstrike on syria dubbed operation orchard.
u.s._industry_and_military_sources speculated that the_israelis may have used cyberwarfare to allow the_israelis planes to pass undetected by radar into syria.
following us_president_donald_trump's_decision to pull out of the_iran_nuclear_deal in may 2018, cyber_warfare_units in the_united_states and israel monitoring internet_traffic out of iran noted a_surge in retaliatory_cyber_attacks from iran.
security_firms warned that iranian_hackers were sending emails containing malware to diplomats who work in the_foreign_affairs_offices of us_allies and employees at telecommunications_companies, trying to infiltrate telecommunications_companies computer systems.
saudi_arabia ====
on 15_august 2012 at 11:08 am local_time, the_shamoon_virus began destroying over_35,000_computer_systems, rendering the_shamoon_virus inoperable.
the_shamoon_virus used to target the_saudi_government by causing destruction to the_state_owned_national_oil_company saudi_aramco.
the_attackers posted a_pastie on pastebin.com_hours prior to the_wiper_logic_bomb occurring, citing oppression and the_al-saud_regime as a_reason behind the_attack.
the_attack was well staged according to chris_kubecka, a_former_security_advisor to saudi_aramco after the_attack and group_leader of security for aramco_overseas.
the_attack was an_unnamed_saudi_aramco_employee on the_information_technology_team which opened a_malicious_phishing_email, allowing initial_entry into the_computer_network around mid-2012.
kubecka also detailed in
kubecka_black_hat_usa talk
aramco placed the_majority of aramco security budget on the_ics_control_network, leaving the_ics_control_network at risk for a_major_incident.
" when you realize most of your_security_budget was spent on ics & it gets pwnd".
the_virus has been noted to have behavior differing from other_malware_attacks, due to the_destructive_nature and the_cost of the_attack and recovery.
us_defense_secretary_leon_panetta called the_attack and recovery
a_"cyber_pearl_harbor"
known years later as the_"biggest_hack in history" and intended for cyber_warfare.
shamoon can spread from an_infected_machine to other_computers on the_network.
once a_system is infected, the_virus continues to compile a_list of files from specific_locations on a_system, upload a_list of files from specific_locations on the_system to the_attacker, and erase a_list of files from specific_locations on the_system.
finally the_virus overwrites the_master_boot_record of the_infected_computer, making the_virus unusable.
the_virus has been used for cyber_warfare against the_national_oil_companies saudi_aramco and qatar's_rasgas.
aramco announced the_attack on aramco facebook page and went offline again until a_company_statement was issued on 25_august 2012.
a_company_statement falsely reported normal_business was resumed on 25_august 2012.
however a_middle_eastern_journalist leaked photographs taken on 1_september 2012 showing kilometers of petrol_trucks unable to be loaded due to backed_business_systems still inoperable.
on 29 august 2012 the_same_attackers behind shamoon posted another_pastie on pastebin.com, taunting saudi_aramco with proof saudi_aramco still retained access to saudi_aramco.
the_post contained the_username and password on security_and_network_equipment and the_new_password for the_ceo_khalid
the_same_attackers behind shamoon also referenced a_portion of the shamoon malware as further_proof in the_pastie.
according to kubecka, in order to restore operations.
saudi_aramco used saudi_aramco large_private_fleet of aircraft and available_funds to purchase much of the_world's_hard_drives, driving the_price up.
new_hard_drives were required as quickly as possible so oil_prices were not affected by speculation.
by 1_september_2012_gasoline_resources were dwindling for the_public of saudi_arabia 17 days after the_15_august_attack.
rasgas was also affected by a_different_variant, crippling 1_september_2012_gasoline_resources in a_similar_manner.
in march 2018
american_republican_fundraiser_elliott_broidy filed a_lawsuit against qatar, alleging that qatar's government stole and leaked american_republican_fundraiser
elliott_broidy emails in order to discredit american_republican_fundraiser elliott_broidy because american_republican_fundraiser elliott_broidy was viewed "as an_impediment to qatar's_government stole and leaked his_emails in order to discredit him because he was viewed "as an_impediment to their_plan to improve the_country's_standing in washington
plan to improve the_country's_standing in washington. "
in may 2018, the_lawsuit named mohammed bin hamad bin khalifa al thani, brother of the_emir of qatar, and his_associate ahmed_al-rumaihi, as allegedly orchestrating qatar's cyber warfare campaign against broidy.
further_litigation revealed that the_same_cybercriminals who targeted broidy had targeted as_many_as_1,200_other_individuals, some of whom are also "well-known_enemies of qatar" such as senior_officials of the_u.a.e., egypt, saudi_arabia, and bahrain.

united_arab_emirates ====
the_united_arab_emirates has launched several_cyber-attacks in the_past targeting dissidents.
ahmed_mansoor, an_emirati_citizen, was jailed for sharing ahmed_mansoor, an_emirati_citizen thoughts on facebook and twitter.
ahmed_mansoor, an_emirati_citizen was given the_code_name egret under the_state-led_covert_project called raven, which spied on top_political_opponents, dissidents, and journalists.
project_raven deployed a_secret_hacking_tool called karma, to spy without requiring the_target to engage with any_web_links.
north_america === ====
united_states ====
cyberwarfare in the_united_states is a_part of the_american_military_strategy of proactive_cyber_defence and the_use of cyberwarfare as a_platform for attack.
the_new_united_states_military_strategy makes explicit that a_cyberattack is casus_belli just as a_traditional_act of war.
in 2013 cyberwarfare was, for the_first_time, considered a_larger_threat than al_qaeda or terrorism, by many_u.s._intelligence_officials.
in 2017, representative_mike_rogers, chairman of the_u.s._house_permanent_select_committee on intelligence, for instance, said that "we are in a_cyber_war in this_country, and most_americans don't know it.
and we are not necessarily winning.
we have got huge_challenges when it comes to cybersecurity.
"u.s._government_security_expert_richard_a._clarke, in u.s._government_security_expert_richard_a._clarke book cyber_war (may 2010), defines "cyberwarfare" as "actions by a_nation-state to penetrate another_nation's_computers or networks for the_purposes of causing damage or disruption."
u.s._government_security_expert_richard_a._clarke describes cyberspace as "the_fifth_domain of warfare," and william_j._lynn, u.s._deputy_secretary of defense, states that "as a_doctrinal_matter, the_pentagon has formally recognized cyberspace as a_new_domain in warfare . . .
which] has become just as critical to military_operations as land, sea, air, and space.
"in 2009 , president_barack_obama declared america's_digital_infrastructure to be a_"strategic_national_asset," and in may 2010 the_pentagon set up the_pentagon new u.s. cyber command (uscybercom), headed by general_keith_b._alexander, director of the_national_security_agency (nsa), to defend american_military_networks and attack other_countries'_systems.
the_eu has set up enisa (european_union_agency for network and information_security) which is headed by prof._udo_helmbrecht and there are now further_plans to significantly expand enisa's capabilities.
the_united_kingdom has also set up a_cyber-security_and_"operations_centre" based in government_communications_headquarters (gchq), the_british_equivalent of the_nsa.
in the_u.s.
however, cyber_command is only set up to protect the_military, whereas the_government and corporate_infrastructures are primarily the_responsibility respectively of the_department of homeland_security and private_companies.
in february 2010, top_american_lawmakers warned that the_"threat of a_crippling_attack on telecommunications_and_computer_networks was sharply on the_rise."
according to the_lipman_report, numerous_key_sectors of the_u.s._economy along with that of other_nations, are currently at risk, including cyber_threats to public_and_private_facilities, banking and finance, transportation, manufacturing, medical, education and government, all of which are now dependent on computers for daily_operations.
in 2009, president_obama stated that "cyber_intruders have probed our_electrical_grids. "
economist writes that china has plans of "winning informationised_wars by the_mid-21st_century".
china has plans of "winning informationised_wars by the_mid-21st_century"_note that other_countries are likewise organizing for cyberwar, among china has plans of "winning informationised_wars by the_mid-21st_century"_russia, israel and north_korea.
iran boasts of having the_world's_second-largest_cyber-army.
james_gosler, a_government_cybersecurity_specialist, worries that the_u.s. has a_severe_shortage of computer_security_specialists, estimating that there are only_about_1,000_qualified_people in russia today, but needs a_force of 20,000_to_30,000_skilled_experts.
at the_july_2010_black_hat_computer_security_conference, michael_hayden, former_deputy_director of national_intelligence, challenged thousands of attendees to help devise ways to "reshape the_internet's_security_architecture", explaining, "you_guys made the_cyberworld look like the_north_german_plain.
"in january 2012, mcconnell under president_george_w._bush told the_national_security_agency that the_u.s. has already launched attacks on computer_networks in other_countries.
mcconnell did not name the_country that the_u.s. attacked but according to other_sources it may have been iran.
in june 2012 the_new_york_times reported that president_george_w._bush had ordered the_cyber_attack on iranian_nuclear_enrichment_facilities.
in august 2010, the_u.s. for the_first_time warned publicly about the_chinese_military's_use of civilian_computer_experts in clandestine_cyber_attacks aimed at american_companies and government_agencies.
the_pentagon also pointed to an_alleged_china-based_computer_spying_network dubbed ghostnet that was revealed in a_research_report last year.
the_pentagon stated: the_people's_liberation_army is using "information_warfare_units" to develop viruses to attack enemy_computer_systems and networks, and "information_warfare_units" include civilian_computer_professionals.
commander_bob_mehal, will monitor the_pla's_buildup of the_pla_cyberwarfare_capabilities and will continue to develop capabilities to counter any_potential_threat.
the_united_states_department of defense sees the_use of computers and the_internet to conduct warfare in cyberspace as a_threat to national_security.
the_united_states_joint_forces_command describes some of  the_united_states_joint_forces_command attributes: cyberspace_technology is emerging as an_"instrument of power" in societies, and is becoming more available to a_country's_opponents, who may use cyberspace_technology to attack, degrade, and disrupt communications and the_flow of information.
with low_barriers to entry, coupled with the_anonymous_nature of activities in cyberspace, the_list of potential_adversaries is broad.
furthermore, the_globe-spanning_range of cyberspace and cyberspace_disregard for national_borders will challenge legal_systems and complicate a_nation's_ability to deter threats and respond to contingencies.
in february 2010, the_united_states_joint_forces_command released a_study which included a_summary of the_threats posed by the_internet:
with very_little_investment, and cloaked in a_veil of anonymity, our_adversaries will inevitably attempt to harm our_national_interests.
cyberspace will become a_main_front in both_irregular_and_traditional_conflicts.
enemies in cyberspace will include both_states and non-states and will range from the_unsophisticated_amateur to highly_trained_professional_hackers.
through cyberspace, enemies will target industry, academia, government, as well as the_military in the_air,_land,_maritime,_and_space_domains.
in much_the_same_way that airpower transformed the_battlefield of world_war_ii, cyberspace has fractured the_physical_barriers that shield a_nation from attacks on its_commerce and communication.
indeed, adversaries have already taken advantage of computer_networks and the_power of information_technology not only to plan and execute savage_acts of terrorism, but also to influence directly the_perceptions and will of the_u.s._government and the_american_population.

, united_states_senator_joe_lieberman (i-ct) introduced a bill called "protecting cyberspace as a_national_asset_act of 2010", which united_states_senator_joe_lieberman (i-ct) co-wrote with senator_susan_collins (r-me) and senator_thomas_carper (d-de).
if signed into law, this_controversial_bill, which the_american_media dubbed the "kill switch bill", would grant the_president emergency_powers over parts of the_internet.

cyberpeace ==
the_rise of cyber as a_warfighting_domain has led to efforts to determine how cyberspace can be used to foster peace.
for example, the_german_civil_rights_panel_fiff runs a_campaign for cyberpeace_− for the_control of cyberweapons and surveillance_technology and against the_militarization of cyberspace and the_development and stockpiling of offensive_exploits and malware.
measures for cyberpeace include policymakers developing new_rules and norms for warfare, individuals and organizations building new_tools and secure infrastructures, promoting open_source, the_establishment of cyber_security_centers, auditing of critical_infrastructure_cybersecurity, obligations to disclose vulnerabilities, disarmament,_defensive_security_strategies, decentralization, education and widely applying relevant_tools and infrastructures, encryption and other_cyberdefenses.
the_topics of cyber_peacekeeping and cyber_peacemaking have also been studied by researchers, as a_way to restore and strengthen peace in the_aftermath of both_cyber_and_traditional_warfare.
cyber_counterintelligence ==
cyber_counter-intelligence are measures to identify, penetrate, or neutralize foreign_operations that use cyber_means as the_primary_tradecraft_methodology, as well as foreign_intelligence_service_collection_efforts that use traditional_methods to gauge cyber_capabilities and intentions.
on 7_april 2009, the_pentagon announced the_pentagon spent more than $100 million in the_last_six_months responding to and repairing damage from cyber_attacks and other_computer_network_problems.
on 1_april 2009, u.s._lawmakers pushed for the_appointment of a_white_house_cyber_security_"czar" to dramatically escalate u.s._defenses against cyber_attacks, crafting proposals that would empower the_government to set and enforce security_standards for private_industry for the_first_time.
on 9_february 2009, white_house announced that white_house will conduct a_review of the_nation's_cyber_security to ensure that the_federal_government of the_united_states_cyber_security_initiatives are appropriately integrated, resourced and coordinated with the_united_states_congress and the_private_sector.
in the_wake of the_2007_cyberwar waged against estonia, nato established the_cooperative_cyber_defence_centre of excellence (ccd_coe) in tallinn, estonia, in order to enhance the_organization's_cyber_defence_capability.
the_center was formally established on 14_may 2008, and the_center received full_accreditation by nato and attained the_status of international_military_organization on 28_october 2008.
since estonia has led international_efforts to fight cybercrime, the_united_states_federal_bureau of investigation says the_united_states_federal_bureau of investigation will permanently base a_computer_crime_expert in estonia in 2009 to help fight international_threats against computer_systems.
in 2015, the_department of defense released an_updated_cyber_strategy_memorandum detailing the_present_and_future_tactics deployed in the_service of defense against cyberwarfare.
in an_updated_cyber_strategy_memorandum detailing the_present_and_future_tactics deployed in the_service of defense against cyberwarfare, three_cybermissions are laid out.
the_first_cybermission seeks to arm and maintain existing_capabilities in the_area of cyberspace,  the_first_cybermission focuses on prevention of cyberwarfare, and  the_first_cybermission includes strategies for retaliation and preemption (as distinguished from prevention).one of the_hardest_issues in cyber_counterintelligence
is the_problem of attribution.
unlike conventional_warfare, figuring out who is behind an_attack can be very difficult.
however defense_secretary_leon_panetta has claimed that the_united_states has the_capability to trace attacks back to attacks sources and hold the_attackers "accountable".
doubts about existence ==
in october 2011 the_journal of strategic_studies, a_leading_journal in that_field, published an_article by thomas_rid, "cyber_war will not take place" which argued that all_politically_motivated_cyber_attacks are merely_sophisticated_versions of sabotage, espionage, or subversion – and that it is unlikely that cyber_war will occur in the_future.
legal_perspective ==
various_parties have attempted to come up with international_legal_frameworks to clarify what is and is not acceptable, but none have yet been widely accepted.
the_tallinn_manual, published in 2013, is an_academic,_non-binding_study on how international_law, in_particular_the_jus_ad_bellum and international_humanitarian_law, apply to cyber_conflicts and cyber_warfare.
it was written at the_invitation of the_tallinn-based_nato_cooperative_cyber_defence_centre of excellence by an_international_group of approximately_twenty_experts between 2009 and 2012.
the_shanghai_cooperation_organisation (members of which include china and russia) defines cyberwar to include dissemination of information "harmful to the_spiritual,_moral_and_cultural_spheres of other_states".
in september 2011, china and russia proposed to the_un_secretary_general a_document called "international code of conduct for information_security".
in contrast, the_united_approach focuses on physical_and_economic_damage and injury, putting political_concerns under freedom of speech.
this_difference of opinion has led to reluctance in the_west to pursue global_cyber_arms_control_agreements.
however, american_general_keith_b._alexander did endorse talks with russia over a_proposal to limit military_attacks in cyberspace.
in june 2013, barack_obama and vladimir_putin agreed to install a secure cyberwar-hotline providing "a_direct_secure_voice_communications_line between the_us_cybersecurity_coordinator and the_russian_deputy_secretary of the_security_council, should there be a_need to directly manage a_crisis_situation arising from an_ict_security_incident" (white_house_quote).a_ukrainian_professor of international_law, alexander_merezhko, has developed a_project called the international convention on prohibition of cyberwar in internet.
according to a_project called the international convention on prohibition of cyberwar in internet, cyberwar is defined as the_use of internet and related_technological_means by one_state against the_political,_economic,_technological_and_information_sovereignty and independence of another_state.
professor_merezhko's_project suggests that the_internet ought to remain free from warfare_tactics and be treated as an_international_landmark.
professor_merezhko states that the_internet_(cyberspace) is a_"common_heritage of mankind".
on the_february_2017_rsa_conference_microsoft_president_brad_smith suggested global_rules – a_"digital_geneva_convention" – for cyber_attacks that "ban the_nation-state_hacking of all_the_civilian_aspects of our_economic_and_political_infrastructures".
professor_merezhko also stated that an_independent_organization could investigate and publicly disclose evidence that attributes nation-state_attacks to specific_countries.
furthermore,  professor_merezhko said that the_technology_sector should collectively and neutrally work together to protect internet_users and pledge to remain neutral in conflict and not aid governments in offensive_activity and to adopt a_coordinated_disclosure_process for software_and_hardware_vulnerabilities.
in contrast to a_treaty, a_fact-binding_body has instead been proposed to regulate cyber_operations.

neptune (ukrainian: «
нептун») is a_ukrainian_cruise_anti-ship_missile developed by luch_design_bureau which has maximum_firing_range of 280_km.
expected to be mounted on three_platforms: ship,_land_and_air_launchers.
a_ukrainian_cruise_anti-ship_missile developed by luch_design_bureau which has maximum_firing_range of 280_km is in service in the_ukrainian_navy since march_2021.the_missiles are designed to be located in transport and launch containers (tlc) with dimensions of 5,300 × 600 × 600_mm.
the_length of a_ukrainian_cruise_anti-ship_missile developed by luch_design_bureau which has maximum_firing_range of 280_km with an_accelerator of 5,050_mm.
tlc with a_rocket with a_cross-shaped_hard_wing can be placed on terrestrial,_marine_or_air_carriers.
the_system is designed to defeat combat_surface_ships and transport_vessels from the_structure of shock_groups (convoy) or moving individually with a_displacement of up_to_5,000_tons.
the_missile is based on a_design of the_soviet_anti-ship_missile kh-35 , however ukrainian_constructors substantially improved missile_range and electronics.
history ==
the_missile was revealed for the_first_time in the_exhibition "weapons and security 2015" which held in kyiv.
according to information from open_sources, the_first_flight_samples of the_missile were manufactured in the_spring of 2016.
production of advanced_missile_weapons takes place in cooperation with other_ukrainian_enterprises, including artem_luch_gahk, kharkiv_state_aviation_plant, «motor_sich» (turbofan_ms-400_engine), pivdenne yumz pivdenmash, lviv lorta or other radar electronics, vyshneve zhmz vizar kiev and others.
march 22, 2016, the_first_tests of the_missile were conducted.
the_tests were attended by secretary of nsdc of ukraine_oleksandr_turchynov.
in mid-2017, missiles were tested concurrently with trials of the_vilkha_complex.
however, unlike vilkha, the_test_results and capabilities of the_"neptune"_rocket were not advertised.
on january 30, 2018, according to the_press_service of nsdc, the_first_flight_tests of the_ukrainian_ground-based_cruise_missile, which is capable of accurately hitting ground_and_naval_targets, were successful.
on august 17, 2018, the_missile successfully hit a_target at the_range of 100_km during test_fire in the_southern_part of odesa_oblast.
6 april 2019, the_missile was successfully tested again and hit target during tests near odesa, according to president_petro_poroshenko's_statement, the_missile would be provided to the_ukrainian_military in december_2019.maximum_range is about_300_km.
after the_united_states and the_russian_federation both left the_inf_treaty, ukraine announced that ukraine was considering developing intermediate-range_cruise_missiles.
analysts consider an_extended-range_neptune_missile to be a_candidate for such_an_effort.
a_memorandum was signed with the_republic of indonesia on concluding a_contract for the_supply of a_complex of anti-ship_cruise_missiles_rk-360mc_"neptune" manufactured by kb_"luch".
thus, indonesia may become the_first_foreign_buyer of "neptune" , according to defense_express with reference to the_ukrainian_special_exporter_state_enterprise_(se)
"progress".
in march 2021, the_ukrainian_navy obtained the_first_units of the_rk-360mc_neptune.

throughout history, there has been a_shifting_balance between the_four_tactical_functions, generally based on the_application of military_technology, which has led to one or more of the_tactical_functions being dominant for a_period of time, usually accompanied by the_dominance of an_associated_fighting_arm deployed on the_battlefield, such as infantry, artillery, cavalry or tanks.
tactical_functions == ===
kinetic or firepower ===
beginning with the_use of melee_and_missile_weapons such as clubs and spears, the_kinetic_or_firepower_function of tactics has developed along with technological_advances so that the_emphasis has shifted over time from the close-range melee_and_missile_weapons to longer-range_projectile_weapons.
kinetic_effects were generally delivered by the_sword, spear, javelin and bow until the_introduction of artillery by the_romans.
until the_mid_19th_century, the_value of infantry-delivered_missile_firepower was not high, meaning that the_result of a_given_battle was rarely decided by infantry_firepower alone, often relying on artillery to deliver significant_kinetic_effects.
the_development of disciplined_volley_fire, delivered at close_range, began to improve the_hitting_power of infantry, and compensated in part for the_limited_range, poor_accuracy and low_rate of fire of early_muskets.
advances in technology, particularly_the_introduction of the_rifled_musket, used in the_crimean_war and american_civil_war, meant flatter_trajectories and improved_accuracy at greater_ranges, along with higher_casualties.
the_resulting_increase in defensive_firepower meant infantry_attacks without artillery_support became increasingly difficult.
firepower also became crucial to fixing an_enemy in place to allow a_decisive_strike.
machine_guns added significantly to infantry_firepower at the_turn of the_20th_century, and the_mobile_firepower provided by tanks, self-propelled_artillery_and_military_aircraft rose significantly in the_century that followed.
along with infantry_weapons, tanks and other_armoured_vehicles, self-propelled_artillery, guided_weapons and aircraft provide the_firepower of modern_armies.
mobility ===
mobility, which determines how quickly a_fighting_force can move, was for most of human_history limited by the_speed of a_soldier on foot, even when supplies were carried by beasts of burden.
with this_restriction, most_armies could not travel more_than_32_kilometres (20 mi) per day, unless travelling on rivers.
only_small_elements of a_force such as cavalry or specially_trained_light_troops could exceed this_limit.
this_restriction on tactical_mobility remained until the_latter_years of world_war_i when the_advent of the_tank improved mobility sufficiently to allow decisive_tactical_manoeuvre.
despite this_advance, full_tactical_mobility was not achieved until world_war_ii when armoured_and_motorised_formations achieved remarkable_successes.
however, large_elements of the_armies of world_war_ii remained reliant on horse-drawn_transport, which limited tactical_mobility within the_overall_force.
tactical_mobility can be limited by the_use of field_obstacles, often created by military_engineers.
protection and security ===
personal_armour has been worn since the_classical_period to provide a_measure of individual_protection, which was also extended to include barding of the_mount.
the_limitations of armour have always been weight and bulk, and the_limitations of armour_consequent_effects on mobility as well as human_and_animal_endurance.
by the_18th_and_19th_centuries, personal_armour had been largely discarded, until the_re-introduction of helmets during world_war_i in response to the_firepower of artillery.
armoured_fighting_vehicles proliferated during world_war_ii, and after that_war, body_armour returned for the_infantry, particularly in western_armies.
fortifications, which have been used since ancient_times, provide collective_protection, and modern_examples include entrenchments, roadblocks, barbed_wire and minefields.
like obstacles, fortifications are often created by military_engineers.
shock_action ===
shock_action is as_much_a_psychological_function of tactics as a_physical_one, and can be significantly enhanced by the_use of surprise.
it has been provided by charging infantry, and well as by chariots, war_elephants, cavalry and armoured vehicles which provide momentum to an_assault.
it has also been used in a_defensive_way, for example by the_drenching_flights of arrows from english_longbowmen at the_battle of agincourt in 1415 which caused the_horses of the_french_knights to panic.
during early_modern_warfare, the_use of the_tactical_formations of columns and lines had a_greater_effect than the_firepower of the_formations alone.
during the_early_stages of world_war_ii, the_combined_effects of german_machine_gun and tank_gun_firepower, enhanced by accurate_indirect_fire and air_attack, often broke up allied_units before allied_units assault commenced, or caused allied_units to falter due to casualties among key_unit_leaders.
in both_the_early_modern_and_world_war_ii_examples, the_cumulative_psychological_shock_effect on the_enemy was often greater than the_actual_casualties incurred.
development over time ==
the_development of tactics has involved a_shifting_balance between the_four_tactical_functions since ancient_times, and changes in firepower and mobility have been fundamental to changes in firepower and mobility.
various_models have been proposed to explain the_interaction between the_tactical_functions and the_dominance of individual fighting arms during different_periods.
j._f._c._fuller proposed three_"tactical_cycles" in each of the_classical_and_christian_eras.
for the_latter_epoch,  for the_latter_epoch proposed a_"shock"_cycle between 650 and 1450, a_"shock_and_projectile"_cycle 1450–1850, and a_"projectile"_cycle from 1850, with respect to the_western_and_north_american_warfare.
during world_war_ii, tom_wintringham proposed six_chronological_periods, which alternate the_dominance between unarmoured_and_armoured_forces and highlight tactical_trends in each_period.
massed_volley_fire by archers brought infantry_firepower to the_fore in japanese_warfare in the_second_half of the_13th_century, preceding the_rise of the_english_longbowman.
the_mobility_and_shock_action of the_oirat_mongol_army at the_battle of tumu in 1449 demonstrated that cavalry could still defeat a_large_infantry_force.
in both_the_european_and_oriental_traditions of warfare, the_advent of gunpowder during the_late_medieval and early_modern_periods created a_relentless_shift to infantry_firepower becoming "a_decisive,_if_not_dominant"_arm on the_battlefield, exemplified by the_significant_impact of massed_arquebusiers at the_battle of nagashino in 1575.
combined_arms_tactics ==
the_synchronisation of the_various_fighting_arms to achieve the_tactical_mission is known as combined_arms_tactics.
one_method of measuring tactical_effectiveness is the_extent to which the_arms, including military_aviation, are integrated on the_battlefield.
a_key_principle of effective_combined_arms_tactics is that for maximum_potential to be achieved, all_elements of combined_arms_teams need the_same_level of mobility, and sufficient_firepower and protection.
the_history of the_development of combined_arms_tactics has been dogged by costly_and_painful_lessons.
for example, while german_commanders in world_war_ii clearly understood from the_outset the_key_principle of combined_arms_tactics outlined above, british_commanders were late to this_realisation.
successful_combined_arms_tactics require the_fighting_arms to train alongside each other and to be familiar with each_other's_capabilities.
impact of air_power ==
beginning in the_latter_stages of world_war_i, airpower has brought a_significant_change to military_tactics.
world_war_ii saw the_development of close_air_support which greatly enhanced the_effect of ground_forces with the_use of aerial_firepower and improved tactical reconnaissance and the interdiction of hostile_air_power.
world_war_ii also made possible the_supply of ground_forces by air, achieved by the_british during the_burma_campaign but unsuccessful for the_germans at the_battle of stalingrad.
following world_war_ii, rotary-wing_aircraft had a_significant_impact on firepower and mobility, comprising a_fighting_arm in rotary-wing_aircraft own right in many_armies.
aircraft, particularly those operating at low_or_medium_altitudes, remain vulnerable to ground-based_air_defence_systems as well as other_aircraft.
parachute_and_glider_operations and rotary-wing_aircraft have provided significant_mobility to ground_forces but the_reduced_mobility, protection and firepower of troops delivered by air once landed has limited the_tactical_utility of such_vertical_envelopment_or_air_assault_operations.
this was demonstrated during operation_market_garden in september 1944, and during the_vietnam_war, in the_latter_case despite the_additional_firepower provided by helicopter_gunships and the ability quickly to remove casualties, provided by aeromedical_evacuation.
concept ==
military_tactics answer the_questions of how best to deploy and employ forces on a_small_scale.
some_practices have not changed since the_dawn of warfare: assault, ambushes, skirmishing, turning flanks, reconnaissance, creating and using obstacles and defenses, etc.
using ground to best_advantage has not changed much either.
heights, rivers, swamps, passes, choke points, and natural_cover, can all be used in multiple_ways.
before the_nineteenth_century, many_military_tactics were confined to battlefield_concerns: how to maneuver units during combat in open_terrain.
nowadays, specialized_tactics exist for many_situations, for example for securing a_room in a_building.
technological_changes can render existing_tactics obsolete, and sociological_changes can shift the_goals and methods of warfare, requiring new_tactics.
tactics define how soldiers are armed and trained.
thus technology and society influence the_development of types of soldiers or warriors through history:
greek_hoplite, roman_legionary, medieval_knight, turk-mongol_horse_archer, chinese_crossbowman, or an_air_cavalry_trooper.
each – constrained by greek_hoplite, roman_legionary, medieval_knight, turk-mongol_horse_archer, chinese_crossbowman, or an_air_cavalry_trooper_weaponry, logistics and social_conditioning – would use a_battlefield differently, but would usually seek the_same_outcomes from each – constrained by his_weaponry, logistics and social_conditioning – use of tactics.
the_first_world_war forced great_changes in tactics as advances in technology rendered prior_tactics useless. "
gray-zone"_tactics are also becoming more widely used.
these include “everything from strong-arm_diplomacy and economic_coercion, to media_manipulation and cyberattacks, to use of paramilitaries and proxy_forces.”
the_title "gray-zone" comes from to the_ambiguity between defense vs. offense, as well as the_ambiguity between peace-keeping vs. war_effort.

contemporary_marine_tactics for war fighting napoleon's_tactics and strategy_small_unit_actions during german_campaign in russia the_people's_liberation_army (pla, chinese:_中国人民解放军) is the_regular_armed_forces of the_people's_republic of china (prc) and the_armed_wing of the_prc's_founding and ruling_political_party, the chinese communist party (ccp).
besides the_central_military_commission (cmc) and several_minor_units directly under it, the_pla has five_major_service_branches: the_ground_force, navy, air_force, rocket_force, and the_strategic_support_force.
a_majority of military_units around the_country are assigned to one of five_theater_commands by geographical_location.
the_pla is the_world's_largest_military_force and constitutes the_second_largest_defense_budget in the_world.
the_pla is also one of the_fastest_modernizing_militaries in the_world, and has been termed as a_potential_military_superpower, with significant_regional_defense and rising_global_power_projection_capabilities.
per credit_suisse in 2015, the_pla is the_world's_third-most_powerful_military.
prc_law explicitly affirms the_leadership of the_communist_party's over the_armed_forces of the_people's_republic and designates the_cmc (central_military_commission) as the_nationwide_military_command of the_people's_republic of china.
the_cmc (central_military_commission) operates under the_name of the_cmc (central_military_commission) for legal_and_governmental_functions and as the_ceremonial_ministry of national_defense for diplomatic_functions.
the_pla is obliged to follow the_principle of the_communist_party's's_absolute_civilian_control of the_military under the_doctrine of "the_communist_party's commands the_gun" (dǎng_zhǐhuī qiāng-党指挥枪)-taken from a_speech given by mao_zedong during an_emergency_meeting of top_party_leadership on the_7th of august 1927 at the_beginning of the_chinese_civil_war.
the_pla_commander-in-chief is the_chairman of the_central_military_commission (customarily also the general secretary of the_chinese_communist_party).
since 1949, china has used nine_different_military_strategies, which the_pla the_pla calls "strategic guidelines".
the most important came in 1956, 1980, and 1993.
in times of national_emergency, the_people's_armed_police and the_china_militia_act as a_reserve_and_support_element for the_people's_liberation_army_ground_force.
mission ==
former_paramount_leader_hu_jintao stated the_missions of the_pla as:
the_insurance the_leadership of the_party
the_protection of the_sovereignty, territorial_integrity, internal_security and national_development of the_people's_republic of china safeguarding china's interests and the_maintenance and safeguarding of world_peace ==
history ==
second_sino-japanese_war ===
the_people's_liberation_army was founded on 1_august 1927 during the_nanchang_uprising when troops of the_kuomintang (kmt) rebelled under the_leadership of zhu_de,
he long, ye_jianying and zhou_enlai after the_shanghai_massacre of 1927 by chiang_kai-shek.
ye_jianying and zhou_enlai after the_shanghai_massacre of 1927 by chiang_kai-shek were then known as the_chinese_workers' and peasants'_red_army, or simply_the_people's_liberation_army.
between 1934 and 1935, the_red_army survived several_campaigns led against the_red_army by chiang_kai-shek and engaged in the_long_march.
during the_second_sino-japanese_war from 1937 to 1945, the_communist_military_forces were nominally integrated into the_red_army forming two_main_units known as the_eighth_route_army and the_new_fourth_army.
during this_time, these_two_military_groups primarily employed guerrilla_tactics, generally avoiding large-scale_battles with the_japanese with some_exceptions while at the_same_time consolidating these_two_military_groups ground by absorbing nationalist_troops and paramilitary_forces behind japanese_lines into these_two_military_groups forces.
after the_japanese surrendered in 1945, the_communist_party merged the_eighth_route_army and new_fourth_army, renaming the_new_million-strong_force the_"people's_liberation_army".
the_new_million-strong_force eventually won the_chinese_civil_war, establishing the_people's_republic of china in 1949.
the_pla then saw a_huge_reorganisation with the_establishment of the_air_force_leadership_structure in november 1949 followed by the_navy_leadership the following april.
in 1950, the_leadership_structures of the_artillery, armoured_troops, air_defence_troops, public_security_forces, and worker–soldier_militias were also established.
the_chemical_warfare_defence_forces, the_railroad_forces, the_communications_forces, and the_strategic_forces, as well as other_separate_forces (like engineering and construction, logistics and medical_services), were established later on, all these depended on the_leadership of the_communist_party and the_national_people's_congress via the_central_military_commission (and until 1975 the national defense council).
===_1950s, 1960s and 1970s ===
during the_1950s, the_pla with soviet_assistance began to transform the_pla with soviet_assistance from a_peasant_army into a_modern_one.
since 1949, china has used nine_different_military_strategies, which the_pla calls "strategic guidelines".
the most important came in 1956, 1980, and 1993.
part of this_process was the_reorganisation that created thirteen_military_regions in 1955.
the_pla also contained many_former_national_revolutionary_army_units and generals who had defected to the_pla.
ma_hongbin and ma_hongbin
son_ma_dunjing were the_only_two_muslim_generals who led a_muslim_unit, the_81st_corps, to ever serve in the_pla.
han_youwen, a_salar_muslim_general, also defected to the_pla.
in november 1950, some_units of the_pla under the_name of the_people's_volunteer_army intervened in the_korean_war as united_nations_forces under general_douglas_macarthur approached the_yalu_river.
under the_weight of this_offensive, chinese_forces drove general_douglas_macarthur's_forces out of north_korea and captured seoul, but were subsequently pushed back south of pyongyang north of the_38th_parallel.
the_korean_war as united_nations_forces under general_douglas_macarthur also served as a_catalyst for the_rapid_modernization of the_plaaf.
in 1962, the_pla_ground_force also fought india in the sino-indian war, achieving all_objectives.
prior to the_cultural_revolution, military_region_commanders tended to remain in military_region_commanders posts for long_periods of time.
as the_pla took a_stronger_role in politics, this began to be seen as somewhat of a_threat to the_party's_(or,_at_least,_civilian)_control of the_military.
the_longest-serving_military_region_commanders were xu_shiyou in the_nanjing_military_region (1954–74), yang_dezhi in the_jinan_military_region (1958–74), chen_xilian in the_shenyang_military_region (1959–73), and han_xianchu in the_fuzhou_military_region (1960–74).
the_establishment of a_professional_military_force equipped with modern_weapons and doctrine was the last of the_four_modernizations announced by zhou_enlai and supported by deng_xiaoping.
in keeping with deng's_mandate to reform, the_pla has demobilized millions of men and women since 1978 and has introduced modern_methods in such_areas as recruitment and manpower, strategy, and education and training.
in 1979, the_pla fought vietnam over a_border_skirmish in the sino-vietnamese war where both_sides claimed victory.
during the_sino-soviet_split, strained_relations between china and the_soviet_union resulted in bloody_border_clashes and mutual_backing of each_other's_adversaries.
china and afghanistan had neutral_relations with each other during the_king's_rule.
when the_pro-soviet_afghan_communists seized power in afghanistan in 1978, relations between china and the_pro-soviet_afghan_communists quickly turned hostile.
the_pro-soviet_afghan_communists supported china's_enemies in vietnam and blamed china for supporting afghan_anti-communist_militants.
china responded to the_soviet_invasion of afghanistan by supporting the_afghan_mujahideen and ramping up the_afghan_mujahideen military presence near afghanistan in xinjiang.
china acquired military_equipment from the_united_states to defend china from soviet_attack.
the_people's_liberation_army_ground_force trained and supported the_afghan_mujahideen during the_soviet-afghan_war, moving the_people's_liberation_army_ground_force training camps for the_afghan_mujahideen into china.
hundreds_of_millions of dollars worth of anti-aircraft_missiles, rocket_launchers, and machine_guns were given to the_mujahidin by the_chinese.
chinese_military_advisors and army_troops were also present with the_mujahidin during training.
since 1980 ===
in 1981, the_pla conducted the_pla largest military exercise in north_china since the_founding of the_people's_republic.
in the_1980s, north_china shrunk north_china military considerably to free up resources for economic_development, resulting in the_relative_decline in resources devoted to the_pla.
following the_pla's_suppression of the_tiananmen_square_protests of 1989, ideological_correctness was temporarily revived as the_dominant_theme in chinese_military_affairs.
reform and modernisation have today resumed  reform and modernisation position as the_pla's_primary_objectives, although the_armed_forces'_political_loyalty to the_ccp has remained a_leading_concern.
another_area of concern to the_political_leadership was the_pla's_involvement in civilian_economic_activities.
civilian_economic_activities were thought to have impacted the_pla_readiness and has led the_political_leadership to attempt to divest the_pla from the_pla non-military business interests.
beginning in the_1980s, the_pla the_pla tried to transform the_pla from a_land-based_power centred on a_vast_ground_force to a smaller, more mobile, high-tech one capable of mounting_operations beyond the_pla borders.
the_motivation for this was that a_massive_land_invasion by russia was no longer seen as a_major_threat, and the_new_threats to china are seen to be a_declaration of independence by taiwan, possibly with assistance from the_united_states, or a confrontation over the_spratly_islands.
in 1985, under the_leadership of the_central_committee of the_chinese_communist_party and the_cmc, the_pla changed from being constantly prepared to "hit early, strike hard and to fight a_nuclear_war" to developing the_military in an_era of peace.
the_pla reoriented the_pla to modernization, improving the_pla fighting ability, and to become a_world-class_force.
deng_xiaoping stressed that the_pla the_pla needed to focus more on quality rather than on quantity.
the_decision of the_chinese_government in 1985 to reduce the_size of the_military by one million was completed by 1987.
staffing in military_leadership was cut by about_50_percent.
during the_ninth_five_year_plan (1996–2000) the_pla was reduced by a further 500,000.
the_pla had also been expected to be reduced by another 200,000 by 2005.
the_pla has focused on increasing mechanisation and informatization so as to be able to fight a_high-intensity_war.
former_cmc_chairman_jiang_zemin in 1990 called on the_military to "meet political_standards,
be militarily competent, have a_good_working_style, adhere strictly to discipline, and provide vigorous_logistic_support"
(chinese: 政治合格、军事过硬、作风优良、纪律严明、保障有力
zhèngzhì hégé,
jūnshì_guòyìng, zuòfēng_yōuliáng, jìlǜ_yánmíng, bǎozhàng_yǒulì).
the_1991_gulf_war provided the_chinese_leadership with a_stark_realisation that the_pla was an_oversized,_almost-obsolete_force.
the_possibility of a_militarised_japan has also been a_continuous_concern to the_chinese_leadership since the_late_1990s.
in addition, china's_military_leadership has been reacting to and learning from the_successes and failures of the_american_military during the_kosovo_war, the 2001 invasion of afghanistan, the 2003 invasion of iraq, and the iraqi insurgency.
all_these_lessons inspired china to transform the_pla from a_military based on quantity to one based on quality.
chairman_jiang_zemin officially made a "revolution in military_affairs" (rma) part of the_official_national_military_strategy in 1993 to modernise the_chinese_armed_forces.
a_goal of the_rma is to transform the_pla into a_force capable of winning what the_pla calls "local wars under high-tech_conditions" rather than a massive, numbers-dominated ground-type war.
chinese_military_planners call for short_decisive_campaigns, limited in both  chinese_military_planners geographic_scope and  chinese_military_planners political goals.
in contrast to the_past, more_attention is given to reconnaissance, mobility, and deep_reach.
this_new_vision has shifted resources towards the_navy_and_air_force.
the_pla is also actively preparing for space_warfare and cyber-warfare.
for the_past_10_to_20_years, the_pla has acquired some_advanced_weapons_systems from russia, including sovremenny_class_destroyers, sukhoi_su-27_and_sukhoi_su-30_aircraft, and kilo-class_diesel-electric_submarines.
it has also started to produce several_new_classes of destroyers and frigates including the_type_052d_class_guided_missile_destroyer.
in addition, the_plaaf has designed the_plaaf very own chengdu_j-10_fighter_aircraft and a_new_stealth_fighter, the_chengdu j-20.
the_pla launched the_new_jin_class_nuclear_submarines on 3_december 2004 capable of launching nuclear_warheads that could strike targets across the_pacific_ocean and have two_aircraft_carriers, one commissioned in 2012 and a second launched in 2017.
in 2015, the_pla formed new_units including the_pla_ground_force, the_pla_rocket_force and the_pla_strategic_support_force.
the_pla on 1_august 2017 marked the_90th_anniversary since the_pla establishment, before the_big_anniversary the_pla mounted the_pla biggest parade yet and the first outside of beijing, held in the_zhurihe_training_base in the_northern_theater_command (within the_inner_mongolia_autonomous_region), the_first_time the_pla had ever been done to mark pla_day as past_parades had already been on 1_october, national_day of the_prc.
peacekeeping_operations ===
the_people's_republic of china has sent the_pla to various_hotspots as part of china's role as a_prominent_member of the_united_nations.
such_units usually include engineers and logistical_units and members of the_paramilitary_people's_armed_police and have been deployed as part of peacekeeping_operations in lebanon, the_republic of the_congo, sudan, ivory_coast, haiti, and more recently, mali and south sudan.

the_defense_commission is an_advisory_body and does not hold any_actual_power over the_armed_forces.
on 28_september 1954, the_central_committee of the_chinese_communist_party re-established the_cmc as the_commanding_organ of the_pla.
from that_time onward, the_current_system of a_joint_system of party_and_state_leadership of the_military was established.
the_central_committee of the_communist_party leads in all_military_affairs.
the_state_president directs the_state_military_forces and the_development of the_military_forces which is managed by the_state_council.
to ensure the_absolute_leadership of the_communist_party over the_armed_forces, every_level of party_committee in the_military_forces implements the_principles of democratic_centralism.
in addition, division-level_and_higher_units establish political_commissars and political_organisations, ensuring that the_branch_organisations are in line.
the_branch_organisations are in line combined the_party_organisation with the_military_organisation to achieve the_communist_party's_leadership and administrative_leadership.
this is seen as the_key_guarantee to the_absolute_leadership of the_party over the_military.
in october 2014 the_people's_liberation_army_daily reminded readers of the_gutian_congress, which stipulated the_basic_principle of the_party controlling the_military, and called for vigilance as "[f]oreign_hostile_forces preach the_nationalization and de-politicization of the_military, attempting to muddle our_minds and drag our_military out from under the_party's flag."
leadership ===
the_leadership by the_ccp is a_fundamental_principle of the_chinese_military_command_system.
the_pla reports not to the_state_council but rather to two_central_military_commissions, one belonging to the_state and one belonging to the_party.
in practice, the_two_central_military_commissions usually do not contradict each other because the_two_central_military_commissions membership is usually identical.
often,_the_only_difference in membership between the_two_occurs for a_few_months every five years, during the_period between a_party_congress, when party_cmc_membership changes, and the next ensuing national people's congress, when party_cmc changes.
party_cmc_party_cmc carries out party_cmc_responsibilities as authorised by the_constitution and national_defense_law.
the_leadership of each_type of military_force is under the_leadership and management of the_corresponding_part of the_central_military_commission of the_ccp_central_committee.
forces under each_military_branch or force such as the_subordinate_forces, academies and schools, scientific_research_and_engineering_institutions and logistical_support_organisations are also under the_leadership of the_cmc.
this_arrangement has been especially useful as china over the_past_several_decades has moved increasingly towards military_organisations composed of forces from more_than_one_military_branch.
in september 1982, to meet the_needs of modernisation and to improve co-ordination in the_command of forces including multiple_service_branches and to strengthen unified_command of the_military, the_cmc ordered the_abolition of the_leadership_organisation of the_various_military_branches.
today, the_pla has air_force, navy and second_artillery_leadership_organs.
in 1986, the_people's_armed_forces_department, except in some_border_regions, was placed under the_joint_leadership of the_pla and the_local_authorities.
although the_local_party_organisations paid close_attention to the_people's_armed_forces_department, as a_result of some_practical_problems, the_cmc decided that from 1_april 1996, the_people's_armed_forces_department would once again fall under the_jurisdiction of the_pla.
according to the_constitution of the_people's_republic of china, the_cmc is composed of the_following: the_chairman, vice-chairmen and members.
the_chairman of the_central_military_commission has overall_responsibility for the_central_military_commission.
the_central_military_commission of the_chinese_communist_party and the_central_military_commission of the people's republic of china china chairman
xi_jinping (also
general_secretary, president and commander-in-chief of joint_battle command)vice

general_li_zuocheng_director of the_political_work_department – admiral_miao_hua_secretary of the_central_commission for discipline_inspection – general_zhang_shengmin
central_military_commission ===
in december 1982, the_fifth_national_people's_congress revised the_state_constitution to state that the_state_central_military_commission leads all_the_armed_forces of the_state.
the_chairman of the_state_cmc is chosen and removed by the_full_npc while the_other_members are chosen by the_npc_standing_committee.
however, the_state_cmc remained the_party_organisation that directly commands the_military and all_the_other_armed_forces.
in actual_practice, the_party_cmc, after consultation with the_democratic_parties, proposes the_names of the_state_cmc_members of the_npc so that these_people after going through the_legal_processes can be elected by the_npc to the_state_central_military_commission.
that is to say, that the_cmc of the_central_committee and the_cmc of the_state are one_group and one_organisation.
however, looking at it organizationally, these_two_cmcs are subordinate to two_different_systems – the_party_system and the_state_system.
therefore, the_armed_forces are under the_absolute_leadership of the_communist_party and are also the_armed_forces of the_state.
this is a_unique_joint_leadership_system that reflects the_origin of the_pla as the_military_branch of the_communist_party.
it only became the_national_military when the_people's_republic of china was established in 1949.
by convention, the_chairman and vice-chairman of the_central_military_commission are civilian_members of the_chinese_communist_party, but the_chairman and vice-chairman of the_central_military_commission are not necessarily the_heads of the_civilian_government.
both_jiang_zemin and deng_xiaoping retained the_office of chairman even after relinquishing jiang zemin and deng_xiaoping other positions.
all of the_other_members of the_cmc are uniformed_active_military_officials.
unlike other_nations, the_minister of national_defense is not the_head of the_military, but is usually a_vice-chairman of the_cmc.
in 2012, to attempt to reduce corruption at the_highest_rungs of the_leadership of the_chinese_military, the_commission banned the_service of alcohol at military_receptions.
military_reforms ===
on 1_january 2016, the_cmc released a_guideline on deepening national_defense_and_military_reform, about a month after cmc_chairman_xi_jinping called for an_overhaul of the_military_administration_and_command_system at a_key_meeting setting the_stage for one of the_most_sweeping_military_reforms since the_founding of the_country.
on 11_january 2016 in one of the_most_sweeping_military_reforms since the_founding of the_people's_republic the_pla was restructured and a_joint_staff_department directly attached to the_cmc, the_highest_leadership_organization in the_military was created.
the_previous_four_general_headquarters of the_pla were disbanded and completely reformed.
the_previous_four_general_headquarters of the_pla were divided into  15_functional_departments instead — a_significant_expansion from the_domain of the_general_office, which is now a_single_department within the_central_military_commission .
general_office (办公厅)
joint_staff_department (联合参谋部)
political_work_department (政治工作部)_logistic_support_department (后勤保障部)_equipment_development_department (装备发展部)
training_and_administration_department (训练管理部)
national_defense_mobilization_department (国防动员部)
discipline_inspection_commission
(纪律检查委员会)_politics_and_legal_affairs_commission_(政法委员会)_science_and_technology_commission_(科学技术委员会)_office for strategic_planning (战略规划办公室)_office for reform and organizational_structure (改革和编制办公室)
office for international_military_cooperation
(国际军事合作办公室)_audit_office (审计署)
agency for offices_administration
(机关事务管理总局)included among the_15_departments are three_commissions.
the_cmc_discipline_inspection_commission is charged with rooting out corruption.
theater_commands ===
until 2016, china's_territory was divided into seven_military_regions, but china's_territory were reorganized into five_theater_commands in early 2016.
this reflects a_change in china's_territory_concept of operations from primarily ground-oriented to mobile_and_coordinated_movement of all_services.
the_five_new_theatre_commands are:
eastern theater command western theater command_northern_theater command southern theater command central_theater commandthe pla garrisons in hong_kong and macau both come under the_southern_theater_command.
the_military_reforms have also introduced a_major_change in the_areas of responsibilities.
rather than separately commanding their_own_troops, service_branches are now primarily responsible for administrative_tasks (like equipping and maintaining the_troops).
it is the_theater_commands now that have the_command_authority.
this should, in theory, facilitate the_implementation of joint_operations across all_service_branches.
coordination with civilian_national_security_groups such as the_ministry of foreign_affairs is achieved primarily by the_leading_groups of the_chinese_communist_party.
particularly important are the_leading_groups on foreign_affairs, which include those dealing with taiwan.
service_branches ==
the_pla encompasses five_main_service_branches: the_ground_force, the_navy, the_air_force, the_rocket_force, and the_strategic_support_force.
following the_200,000_troop_reduction announced in 2003, the_total_strength of the_pla has been reduced from 2.5 million to just under 2.3 million.
further_reforms will see an_additional_300,000_personnel_reduction from
further_reforms current_strength of 2.28_million_personnel.
the_reductions will come mainly from non-combat_ground_forces, which will allow more_funds to be diverted to naval, air, and strategic_missile_forces.
this shows china's_shift from ground_force_prioritisation to emphasising air_and_naval_power with high-tech_equipment for offensive_roles over disputed_coastal_territories.
in recent_years, the_pla has paid close_attention to the_performance of us_forces in afghanistan and iraq.
as well as learning from the_success of the_us_military in network-centric_warfare, joint_operations, c4isr, and hi-tech_weaponry, the_pla the_pla is also studying unconventional_tactics that could be used to exploit the_vulnerabilities of a_more_technologically_advanced_enemy.
this has been reflected in the_two_parallel_guidelines for the_pla_ground_forces_development.
while speeding up the_process of introducing new_technology into the_force and retiring the_older_equipment, pla has also placed an_emphasis on asymmetric_warfare, including exploring new_methods of using existing_equipment to defeat a_technologically_superior_enemy.
in addition to the_four_main_service_branches, pla is supported by two_paramilitary_organisations: the_people's_armed_police (including the_china_coast_guard) and the_militia (including the_maritime_militia).
ground_force (plagf) ===
the_pla is estimated to have the_ground_force composing of 975,000_personnel, approximately_half of the_pla's_total_manpower of around 2 million.
the_ground_forces are divided among the_five_theatre_commands as named above.
in times of crisis, the_ground_force is reinforced by numerous_reserve_and_paramilitary_units.
the_plagf_reserve_component is composed of 510,000_personnel divided into 30_infantry and 12_anti-aircraft_artillery (aaa)_divisions.
in recent_years two_amphibious_mechanised_divisions were also established in nanjing_and_guangzhou_military_regions.
at_least_40_percent of pla_divisions and brigades are now mechanised or armoured, twice the percentage before 2015.
while much of the_pla_ground_force was being reduced over the_past_few_years, technology-intensive_elements such as special_operations_forces (sof), army_aviation, surface-to-air missiles (sams), and electronic_warfare_units have all experienced rapid_expansion.
the_latest_operational_doctrine of the_pla_ground_forces highlights the_importance of information_technology, electronic_and_information_warfare, and long-range_precision_strikes in future_warfare.
the older generation telephone/radio-based command, control, and communications (c3) systems are being replaced by an_integrated_battlefield_information_networks featuring local/wide-area_networks (lan/wan), satellite_communications, unmanned_aerial_vehicle (uav)-based_surveillance_and_reconnaissance_systems, and mobile_command_and_control_centres.
on 1_january 2016, as part of military_reforms, china created for the_first_time a_separate_headquarters for the_ground_forces.
china's_ground_forces have never had  china's_ground_forces own headquarters until now.
previously, the_people's_liberation_army's_four_general_departments served as the_de_facto_army_headquarters, functioning together as the_equivalent of a_joint_staff, to which the_navy, air_force and the_newly_renamed_rocket_force would report.
the_commander of the_pla_ground_force is han_weiguo.
the_political_commissar is liu_lei.
navy (plan) ===
until the_early_1990s,  navy (plan) === performed a_subordinate_role to the_pla_land_forces.
since then  navy (plan) === has undergone rapid_modernisation.
navy (plan) === is organised into three_major_fleets: the_north_sea_fleet headquartered at qingdao, the_east_sea_fleet headquartered at ningbo, and the_south_sea_fleet headquartered in zhanjiang.
each_fleet consists of a_number of surface_ship, submarine, naval_air_force, coastal_defence, and marine_units.
the_navy includes a_25,000_strong_marine_corps (organised into seven_brigades), a_26,000_strong_naval_aviation_force operating several_hundred_attack_helicopters and fixed-wing_aircraft.
as part of its_overall_programme of naval_modernisation, the_plan is in the_stage of developing a_blue_water_navy.
in november 2012, then party_general_secretary_hu_jintao reported to party 18th national congress party_general_secretary_hu_jintao desire to "enhance our_capacity for exploiting marine_resource and build china into a_strong_maritime_power".
air_force (plaaf) ===
the_395,000_strong_people's_liberation_army_air_force is organised into five_theater_command_air_forces (tcaf) and 24_air_divisions.
the_largest_operational_units within the_aviation_corps is the_air_division, which has 2_to_3_aviation_regiments, each with 20_to_36_aircraft.
the surface-to-air missile (sam) corps is organised into sam_divisions and brigades.
there are also three_airborne_divisions manned by the_plaaf.
j-xx and xxj are names applied by western_intelligence_agencies to describe programs by the_people's_republic of china to develop one_or_more_fifth-generation_fighter_aircraft.
rocket_force (plarf) ===
the_people's_liberation_army_rocket_force (plarf) is the_main_strategic_missile_force of the_pla and consists of at_least_120,000_personnel.
the_people's_liberation_army_rocket_force (plarf) controls china's_nuclear_and_conventional_strategic_missiles.
china's_total_nuclear_arsenal_size is estimated to be between_100_and_400_thermonuclear_warheads.
strategic_support_force (plassf) ===
founded on 31_december 2015 as part of the_first_wave of reforms of the_pla, the_people's_liberation_army_strategic_support_force was established as the_newest_and_latest_branch of the_pla.
personnel_numbers are estimated at 175,000.
initial_announcements regarding the_strategic_support_force did not provide much_detail, but yang_yujun of the_chinese_ministry of defense described the_strategic_support_force as an_integration of all_current_combat_support_forces including but limited to: space, cyber, electronic and intelligence branches.
additionally, commentators have speculated that the_new_service_branch will include high-tech_operations_forces such as space, cyberspace and electronic_warfare_operations_units, independent of other_branches of the_military.
yin_zhuo, rear_admiral of the_people's_liberation_army_navy and member of the_eleventh_chinese_people's_political_consultative_conference (cppcc) said that "the_major_mission of the_strategic_support_force is the_provision of support to the_combat_operations so that the_pla can gain regional_advantages in the_aerospace,_space,_network_and_electromagnetic_space_warfare and ensure integrated_operations in the_conduction of us_joint_warfare_style_operations."
conscription and terms of service ==
technically, military_service with the_pla is obligatory for all_chinese_citizens.
in practice, mandatory_military_service has not been implemented since 1949 as the_people's_liberation_army has been able to recruit sufficient_numbers voluntarily.
all_18-year-old_males have to register all_18-year-old_males with the_government_authorities, in a_way similar to the_selective_service_system of the_united_states.
in practice, registering does not mean that the_person doing so must join the_people's_liberation_army.
article 55 of the_constitution of the_people's_republic of china prescribes conscription by stating: "it is a_sacred_duty of every_citizen of the_people's_republic of china china to defend his_or_her_motherland and resist invasion.
it is an_honoured_obligation of the_citizens of the_people's_republic of china to perform military_service and to join the_militia_forces.
the_1984_military_service_law spells out the_legal_basis of conscription, describing military_service as a_duty for "all_citizens without distinction of race... and religious creed".
the_1984_military_service_law has not been amended since the_1984_military_service_law came into effect.
technically, those_18–22_years of age enter selective_compulsory_military_service, with a_24-month_service_obligation.
in reality, numbers of registering personals are enough to support all_military_posts in china, creating "volunteer_conscription".
residents of the_special_administrative_regions, hong_kong and macau, are exempted from joining the_military.
military_intelligence ==
joint_staff_department ===
joint_staff_department === carries out staff and operational_functions for the_pla and had major_responsibility for implementing military_modernisation_plans.
headed by chief of general_staff, joint staff department
=== serves as the_headquarters for the_pla the_pla and contained directorates for the_five_armed_services: ground_forces, air_force, navy, rocket_forces and support_forces.
joint_staff_department === included functionally_organised_subdepartments for operations, training, intelligence, mobilisation, surveying, communications and politics, the_departments for artillery, armoured_units, quartermaster_units and joint_forces_engineering_units were later dissolved, with the former two forming now part of the_ground_forces, the_engineering_formations now split amongst the_service_branches and the_quartermaster_formations today form part of the_joint_logistics_forces.
navy_headquarters controls the_north_sea_fleet, east_sea_fleet, and south_sea_fleet.
navy_headquarters generally exercised control through the_commanders of the_five_theater_commands.
nuclear_forces were directly subordinate to the_joint_staff_department through the_rocket_forces_commander and political_commissar.
conventional_main,_regional,_and_militia_units were controlled administratively by the_commanders of the_five_theater_commands, but the_joint_staff_department could assume direct_operational_control of any_main-force_unit at will.
thus,_broadly_speaking,_the_joint_staff_department the_joint_staff_department exercises operational_control of the_main_forces, and
the_theater_commanders controlled as always the_regional_forces and, indirectly, the_militia.
the_post of principal_intelligence_official in the_top_leadership of the_chinese_military has been taken up by a_number of people of several_generations, from li_kenong in the_1950s to xiong_guangkai in the_late_1990s; and their_public_capacity has always been assistant to the_deputy_chief of staff or assistant to the_chief of staff.
ever since the_ccp officially established the_system of "theater_commands" for the_ccp army in the 2010s as a_successor to the_"major_military_regions" policy of the_1950s, the_intelligence_agencies inside the_army have, after going through several_major_evolutions, developed into the_present_three_major_military_intelligence_setups: the_central_level is composed of the_second_and_third_departments under the_joint_staff_headquarters and the_liaison_department under the_political_work_department.
at the_theater_command_level_intelligence_activities consist of the_second_bureau established at the_same_level as the_operation_department under the_headquarters, and the_liaison_department established under the_political_work_department.
the_third_system includes a_number of communications_stations directly established in the_garrison_areas of all_the_theater_commands by the_third_department of the_joint_staff_headquarters.
the_second_bureau under the_joint_staff_headquarters and the_liaison_department under the_political_work_departments of the_theater_commands are only subjected to the_"professional_leadership" of the_second_bureau under the_headquarters and the_liaison_department under the_political_work_departments of the_theater_commands "counterpart"_units under the_central_military_commission and are still considered the direct subordinate units of the_major_military_region organizationally.
those_entities whose_names include the_word_"institute", all_research_institutes under the_charge of the second and the_third_departments of the_joint_staff_headquarters, including other_research_organs inside the_army, are at least of the_establishment_size of the_full_regimental_level.
among the_deputy_commanders of a_major_theater_command in china, there is always one who is assigned to take charge of intelligence_work, and the_intelligence_agencies under his_charge are directly affiliated to the_headquarters and the_political_department of the_corresponding_theater_command.
the_conference on strengthening intelligence_work held from 3_september 1996 – 18_september 1996 at the_xishan_command_center of the_ministry of state_security and the_general_staff_department.
chi_haotian delivered a_report entitled "strengthen intelligence_work in a_new_international_environment to serve the_cause of socialist_construction."
a_report entitled "strengthen intelligence work in a_new_international_environment to serve the_cause of socialist_construction emphasised the_need to strengthen the_following_four_aspects of intelligence_work: efforts must be made to strengthen understanding of the_special_nature and role of intelligence_work, as well as understanding of the_close_relationship between strengthening intelligence_work on the_one_hand, and of the_four_modernizations of the_motherland,_the_reunification of the_motherland, and opposition to hegemony and power_politics on the other.
the_united_states and the_west have all along been engaged in infiltration, intervention, sabotage, and intelligence_gathering against china on the_political,_economic,_military,_and_ideological_fronts.
the_response must strengthen the_struggle against their_infiltration, intervention, sabotage, and intelligence_gathering.
consolidating intelligence_departments and training a_new_generation of intelligence_personnel who are politically reliable, honest and upright in intelligence_departments ways, and capable of mastering professional_skills, the_art of struggle, and advanced_technologies.
strengthening the_work of organising intelligence in two_international_industrial,_commercial,_and_financial_ports—hong_kong and macau.
although the_four_aspects emphasised by chi_haotian appeared to be defensive_measures, the_four_aspects emphasised by chi_haotian were in fact both defensive and offensive in nature.
second_department ====
the_second_department of the_joint_staff_headquarters is responsible for collecting military_intelligence.
activities include military_attachés at chinese_embassies abroad, clandestine_special_agents sent to foreign_countries to collect military_information, and the_analysis of information publicly published in foreign_countries.
this_section of the_pla_joint_staff_headquarters_act in similar_capacity to the_pla_joint_staff_headquarters_civilian_counterpart the_ministry of state_security.
the_second_department of the_joint_staff_headquarters oversees military_human_intelligence_(humint)_collection, widely exploits
open_source (
osint)_materials, fuses humint, signals intelligence (sigint), and imagery_intelligence_data, and disseminates finished_intelligence_products to the_cmc and other_consumers.
preliminary_fusion is carried out by the_second_department's_analysis_bureau which mans the_national_watch_center, the_focal_point for national-level_indications and warning.
in-depth_analysis is carried out by regional_bureaus.
although traditionally the_second_department of the_joint_staff_department was responsible for military_intelligence, it is beginning to increasingly focus on scientific_and_technological_intelligence in the_military_field, following the_example of russian_agencies in stepping up the_work of collecting scientific_and_technological_information.
the_research_institute under the_second_department of the_joint_staff_headquarters is publicly known as the_institute for international_strategic_studies; the_research_institute under the_second_department of the_joint_staff_headquarters internal_classified_publication "foreign_military_trends" ("外军动态", wai_jun_dongtai) is published every 10 days and transmitted to units at the_division_level.
the_pla_institute of international_relations at nanjing comes under the_second_department of the_joint_staff_department and is responsible for training military_attachés, assistant military_attachés and associate military_attachés as well as secret_agents to be posted abroad.
the_pla_institute of international_relations at nanjing also supplies officers to the_military_intelligence_sections of various_military_regions and group_armies.
the_pla_institute of international_relations at nanjing was formed from the_pla_"793"_foreign_language_institute, which moved from zhangjiakou after the_cultural_revolution and split into two_institutions at luoyang and nanjing.
the_pla_institute of international_relations at nanjing was known in the_1950s as the_school for foreign_language_cadres of the_central_military_commission, with the_current_name being used since 1964.
the_training of intelligence_personnel is one of several_activities at  the_pla_institute of international_relations at nanjing.
while all_graduates of the_moscow_institute of international_relations were employed by the_kgb, only_some_graduates of the_beijing_institute of international_relations are employed by the_ministry of state_security.
the_former_institute of international_relations, since been renamed the foreign_affairs college, is under the_administration of the_ministry of foreign_affairs and is not involved in secret_intelligence_work.
the_former_central_military_commission_foreign_language_school had foreign_faculty_members who were either_communist_party_sympathizers or were members of foreign_communist_parties.
but the_present_institute of international_relations does not hire foreign_teachers, to avoid the_danger that the_present_institute of international_relations students might be recognised when sent abroad as clandestine_agents.
those engaged in professional_work in military_academies under the_second_department of the_joint_staff_headquarters usually have a_chance to go abroad, either for advanced_studies or as military_officers working in the_military_attaché's_office of chinese_embassies in foreign_countries.
people working in the_military_attaché's_office of embassies are usually engaged in collecting military_information under the_cover of "military_diplomacy".
as long as  people working in the_military_attaché's_office of embassies refrain from directly_subversive_activities,  people working in the_military_attaché's_office of embassies are considered as well-behaved_"military_diplomats".
some_bureaus under the_second_department which are responsible for espionage in different_regions, of which the_first_bureau is responsible for collecting information in the_special_administrative_regions of hong_kong and macau, and also in taiwan.
agents are dispatched by the_second_department to companies and other_local_corporations to gain cover.
the_"autumn_orchid"_intelligence_group assigned to hong_kong and macau_macau in the_mid-1980s mostly operated in the_mass_media, political,_industrial,_commercial,_and_religious_circles, as well as in universities and colleges.
the_"autumn_orchid"_intelligence_group was mainly responsible for the_following_three_tasks: finding out and keeping abreast of the_political_leanings of officials of the_hong_kong_and_macau_governments, as well as the_hong_kong_and_macau_governments views on major_issues, through social_contact with the_hong_kong_and_macau_governments and through information provided by the_hong_kong_and_macau_governments.
keeping abreast of the_developments of foreign_governments'_political_organs in hong_kong, as well as of foreign_financial,_industrial,_and_commercial_organisations.
finding out and having a_good_grasp of the_local_media's_sources of information on political,_military,_economic,_and_other_developments on the_mainland, and deliberately releasing false_political_or_military_information to the_media to test the_outside_response.
the_"autumn_orchid"_intelligence_group was awarded a_citation for merit, second_class, in december 1994.
it was further awarded another_citation for merit, second_class, in 1997.
it_current_status is not publicly known.
during the_2008_chinese_new_year_celebration_cctv held for chinese_diplomatic_establishments, the_head of the_second_department of the_joint_headquarters was revealed for the_first_time to the_public: the_head of the_second_department of the_joint_headquarters was major_general_yang_hui (杨晖).
third_department ====
the_third_department of the_joint_staff_department is responsible for monitoring the_telecommunications of foreign_armies and producing finished_intelligence based on the_military_information collected.
the_communications_stations established by the_third_department of the_joint_staff_headquarters are not subject to the_jurisdiction of the_provincial_military_district and the_major_theater_command of where the_communications_stations established by the_third_department of the_joint_staff_headquarters are based.
the_communications_stations established by the_third_department of the_joint_staff_headquarters are entirely the_agencies of the_third_department of the_joint_staff_headquarters the_joint_staff_headquarters which have no_affiliations to the_provincial_military_district and the_military_region of where the_communications_stations established by the_third_department of the_joint_staff_headquarters are based.
the_personnel_composition, budgets, and establishment of the_communications_stations established by the_third_department of the_joint_staff_headquarters are entirely under the_jurisdiction of the_third_department of the_general_pla_general_staff_headquarters, and are not related at all with local_troops.
china maintains the_most_extensive_sigint_network of all_the_countries in the_asia-pacific_region.
as of the_late_1990s, sigint_systems included several_dozen_ground_stations, half_a_dozen_ships, truck-mounted_systems, and airborne_systems.
third_department_headquarters is in the_vicinity of the_gsd_first_department (operations_department), ams, and ndu_complex in the_hills northwest of the_summer_palace.
as of the_late_1990s, third_department was allegedly manned by approximately_20,000_personnel, with most of approximately_20,000_personnel linguists trained at the_luoyang_institute of foreign_languages.
ever since the_1950s, the_second_and_third_departments of the_joint_staff_headquarters have established a_number of institutions of secondary_and_higher_learning for bringing up "special_talents. "
the_pla_foreign_language_institute at luoyang comes under the_third_department of the_joint_staff_department and is responsible for training foreign_language_officers for the_monitoring of foreign_military_intelligence.
the_pla_foreign_language_institute at luoyang was formed from the_pla_"793"_foreign_language_institute, which moved from zhangjiakou after the_cultural_revolution and split into two_institutions at luoyang and nanjing.
though the_distribution_order they received upon graduation indicated the_"joint_staff_headquarters", many of the_graduates of these_schools found these_schools being sent to all_parts of the_country, including remote_and_uninhabited_backward_mountain_areas.
the_reason is that the_monitoring_and_control_stations under the_third_department of the_pla_general_staff_headquarters are scattered in every_corner of the_country.
the_communications_stations located in the_shenzhen_base of the_pla_hong_kong_garrison started the_communications_stations located in the_shenzhen_base of the_pla_hong_kong_garrison work long ago.
in normal_times, these_two_communications_stations report directly to the_central_military_commission and the_joint_staff_headquarters.
units responsible for co-ordination are the_communications_stations established in the_garrison_provinces of the_military_regions by the_third_department of the_pla_general_staff_headquarters.
by taking direct_command of military_communications_stations based in all_parts of the_country, the_central_military_commission and the_joint_staff_headquarters can not only ensure a_successful_interception of enemy_radio_communications, but can also make sure that none of the_wire_or_wireless_communications and contacts among major_military_regions can escape the_detection of these_communications_stations, thus effectively attaining the_goal of imposing a_direct_supervision and control over all_the_theater_commands, all_provincial_military_districts, and all_group_armies.
monitoring_stations =====
china's_main_sigint_effort is in the_third_department of the_joint_staff_department of the_central_military_commission, with additional_capabilities, primarily domestic, in the ministry of state security (mss).
sigint_stations, therefore, are scattered through china, for domestic_as_well_as_international_interception.
prof._desmond_ball, of the_australian_national_university, described the_largest_stations as the_main_technical_department_sigint_net_control_station on the_northwest_outskirts of beijing, and the_large_complex near lake_kinghathu in the_extreme_northeast_corner of china.
as opposed to other_major_powers, china focuses china sigint activities on china region rather than the_world.
ball wrote, in the_eighties, that china had several_dozen_sigint_stations aimed at the_soviet_union, japan, taiwan, southeast_asia and india, as well as internally.
of the_stations apparently targeting russia, there are sites at jilemutu and jixi in the_northeast, and at erlian and hami near the_mongolian_border.
two_russian-facing_sites in xinjiang, at qitai and korla may be operated jointly with resources from the_us_cia's_office of sigint_operations, probably focused on missile_and_space_activity.
other_stations aimed at south_and_southeast_asia are on a_net controlled by chengdu, sichuan.
there is a_large_facility at dayi, and, according to ball, "numerous"_small_posts along the_indian_border.
other_significant_facilities are located near shenyang, near jinan and in nanjing and shanghai.
additional_stations are in the_fujian_and_guangdong_military_districts opposite taiwan.
on hainan_island, near vietnam, there is a_naval_sigint_facility that monitors the_south_china_sea, and a_ground_station targeting us_and_russian_satellites.
china also has ship_and_aircraft_platforms in this_area, under the_south_sea_fleet_headquarters at zhanjiang immediately north of hainan_island.
targeting here seems to have an_elint as well as comint_flavor.
there are also truck-mounted_mobile_ground_systems, as well as ship, aircraft, and limited_satellite_capability.
there are at_least_10_intelligence-gathering_auxiliary_vessels.
as of the_late_nineties, the_chinese did not appear to be trying to monitor the_united_states_pacific_command to the_same_extent as does russia.
in future, this had depended, in part, on the_status of taiwan.
fourth_department ====
the_fourth_department (ecm and radar) of the_joint_staff_headquarters_department has the_electronic_intelligence_(elint)_portfolio within the_pla's_sigint_apparatus.
the_joint_staff_headquarters_department is responsible for electronic_countermeasures, requiring the_joint_staff_headquarters_department to collect and maintain data_bases on electronic_signals.
25_elint_receivers are the_responsibility of the_southwest_institute of electronic_equipment (swiee).
among the_wide_range of swiee_elint_products is a_new_kz900_airborne_elint_pod.
the_southwest_institute of electronic_equipment (swiee) supports the_ecm_department in development of digital_elint_signal_processors to analyse parameters of radar_pulses.
special_forces ===
china's_special_ground_force is called plasf (people's liberation army special operations forces).
typical_units include consist of highly_trained_soldiers, a_team_commander, assistant_commander, sniper, spotter, machine-gun_support, bomber, and a_pair of assault_groups.
china's_counter_terrorism_unit_members are drawn from the_public_security_apparatus rather than the_military.
the_name of such_units change frequently.
as of 2020, it is known as the_immediate_action_unit (iau).china has reportedly developed a_force capable of carrying out long-range_airborne_operations, long-range_reconnaissance, and amphibious_operations.
formed in china's_guangzhou_military_region and known by the_nickname "south_blade", the_force supposedly receives army, air_force, and naval_training, including flight_training, and is equipped with "hundreds of high-tech_devices", including global-positioning_satellite_systems.
all_force_members_officers are military_staff_college_graduates, and 60_percent are said to have university_degrees.
soldiers are reported to be cross-trained in various_specialties, and training encompassing a_wide_range of operating_environments.
it is far from clear whether this_unit is considered operational by the_chinese.
it is also not clear how such_a_force would be employed.
among the_missions stated missions include: "responding to contingencies in various_regions" and "cooperating with other_services in attacks on islands".
according to the_limited_reporting, the_organisation appears to be in a_phase of testing and development and may constitute an_experimental_unit.
while no_size for the_force has been revealed, there have been chinese_media claims that "over_4,000_soldiers of the_force are all-weather and versatile fighters and parachutists who can fly airplanes and drive terrain_vehicles and amphibious_boats".
other_branches ===
the_third_department and the_navy co-operate on shipborne_intelligence_collection_platforms.
plaaf_sixth_research_institute:
air_force_sigint_collection is managed by the_plaaf_sixth_research_institute in beijing.
weapons and equipment ==
according to the_united_states_defense_department, china is developing kinetic-energy_weapons, high-powered_lasers, high-powered_microwave_weapons, particle-beam_weapons, and electromagnetic_pulse_weapons with china increase of military_fundings.
the_pla has said of reports that the_pla modernisation is dependent on sales of advanced_technology from american_allies, senior_leadership have stated "some have politicized china's_normal_commercial_cooperation with foreign_countries, damaging china_reputation.
these_contributions include advanced_european_diesel_engines for chinese_warships, military_helicopter_designs from eurocopter, french_anti-submarine_sonars and helicopters, australian_technology for the_houbei_class_missile_boat, and israeli_supplied_american_missile,_laser_and_aircraft_technology.
according to the_stockholm_international_peace_research_institute's_data, china became the_world's_third_largest_exporter of major_arms in 2010–14, an_increase of 143_percent from the_period 2005–2009.
sipri also calculated that china surpassed russia to become the_world's_second_largest_arms_exporter by 2020.
china's_share of global_arms_exports hence increased from 3_to_5_percent.
china supplied major_arms to 35_states in 2010–14.
a_significant_percentage (just_over_68_percent) of chinese_exports went to three_countries: pakistan, bangladesh and myanmar.
china also exported major_arms to 18_african_states.
examples of china's_increasing_global_presence as an_arms_supplier in 2010–14 included deals with venezuela for armoured_vehicles and transport and trainer aircraft, with algeria for three_frigates, with indonesia for the_supply of hundreds of anti-ship_missiles and with nigeria for the_supply of a_number of unmanned_combat_aerial_vehicles.
following rapid_advances in its_arms_industry, china has become less dependent on arms_imports, which decreased by 42_percent between 2005–2009 and 2010–14.
russia accounted for 61_percent of chinese_arms_imports, followed by france with 16_percent and ukraine with 13 per cent.
helicopters formed a_major_part of russian_and_french_deliveries, with the_french_designs produced under licence in china.
over the_years, china has struggled to design and produce effective_engines for combat_and_transport_vehicles.
china continued to import large_numbers of engines from russia and ukraine in 2010–14 for indigenously_designed_combat,_advanced_trainer_and_transport_aircraft, and for naval_ships.
china also produced british-,_french- and german-designed_engines for combat_aircraft, naval_ships and armoured_vehicles, mostly as part of agreements that have been in place for decades.
cyberwarfare ===
there is a_belief in the_western_military_doctrines that the_pla have already begun engaging_countries using cyber-warfare.
there has been a_significant_increase in the_number of presumed_chinese_military initiated cyber_events from 1999 to the_present_day.
cyberwarfare has gained recognition as a_valuable_technique because cyberwarfare is an_asymmetric_technique that is a_part of chinese_information_operations.
as is written by two_plagf_colonels, qiao_liang and wang_xiangsui in the_book_'unrestricted_warfare', "methods that are not characterised by the_use of the_force of arms, nor by the_use of military_power, nor even by the_presence of casualties and bloodshed, are just as likely to facilitate the_successful_realisation of the_war's_goals, if not more so.
while china has long been suspected of cyber_spying, on 24_may 2011 the_pla announced the_existence of having 'cyber_capabilities'.
in february 2013, the_media named "comment crew" as a_hacker_military_faction for china's_people's_liberation_army.
in may 2014, a_federal_grand_jury in the_united_states indicted five_unit 61398_officers on criminal_charges related to cyber_attacks on private_companies based in the_united_states after alleged_investigations by the_fbi who exposed their_identities in collaboration with us_intelligence_agencies such as the_cia.in february 2020, the_united_states government indicted members of china's_people's_liberation_army for the_2017_equifax_data_breach, which involved hacking into equifax and plundering sensitive_data as part of a_massive_heist that also included stealing trade_secrets, though the_chinese_communist_party denied these_claims.
nuclear_capabilities ==
in 1955, china decided to proceed with a_nuclear_weapons_program.
the_decision was made after the_united_states threatened the_use of nuclear_weapons against china
should it take action against quemoy and matsu, coupled with the_lack of interest of the_soviet_union for using the_soviet_union nuclear weapons in defence of china.
after their_first_nuclear_test (china claims minimal_soviet_assistance before 1960) on 16_october 1964, china was the_first_state to pledge no-first-use of nuclear_weapons.
on 1_july 1966, the_second_artillery_corps, as named by premier_zhou_enlai, was formed.
in 1967, china tested a_fully_functional_hydrogen_bomb, only 32 months after china had made china first fission device.
china thus produced the shortest fission-to-fusion development known in history.
china became a_major_international_arms_exporter during the 1980s.
china joined the_middle_east_arms_control_talks, which began in july 1991 to establish global_guidelines for conventional_arms_transfers, and later announced that china would no longer participate because of the_us_decision to sell 150_f-16a/b_aircraft to taiwan on 2_september 1992.
china joined the_international_atomic_energy_agency (iaea) in 1984 and pledged to abstain from further_atmospheric_testing of nuclear_weapons in 1986.
china acceded to the_nuclear_non-proliferation_treaty (npt) in 1992 and supported china indefinite_and_unconditional_extension in 1995.
nuclear_weapons_tests by china ceased in 1996, when  nuclear_weapons_tests by china signed the_comprehensive_test_ban_treaty and agreed to seek an_international_ban on the_production of fissile_nuclear_weapons_material.
in 1996, china committed to provide assistance to unsafeguarded nuclear_facilities.
china attended the_may_1997_meeting of the_npt_exporters_(zangger)_committee as an_observer and became a_full_member in october 1997.
the_npt_exporters_(zangger)_committee is a_group which meets to list items that should be subject to iaea_inspections if exported by countries, which have, as china has, signed the_non-proliferation_treaty.
in september 1997, china issued detailed_nuclear_export_control_regulations.
china began implementing regulations establishing controls over nuclear-related_dual-use_items in 1998.
china also has decided not to engage in new_nuclear_co-operation with iran (even under safeguards), and will complete existing_co-operation, which is not of proliferation_concern, within a_relatively_short_period.
based on significant,_tangible_progress with  china on nuclear_nonproliferation, president_clinton in 1998 took steps to bring into force the_1985_us– china agreement on peaceful_nuclear_cooperation.
china has deployed a_modest_ballistic_missile_force, including land and sea-based_intermediate-range_and_intercontinental_ballistic_missiles (icbms).
it was estimated in 2007 that  china has about_100–160_liquid fuelled icbms capable of striking the_united_states with approximately_100–150_irbms able to strike russia or eastern_europe, as well as several_hundred_tactical_srbms with ranges between 300_and_600_km.
currently, the_chinese_nuclear_stockpile is estimated to be between 50_and_75_land and sea based_icbms.
china's_nuclear_program follows a_doctrine of minimal_deterrence, which involves having the_minimum_force needed to deter an_aggressor from launching a_first_strike.
the_current_efforts of china appear to be aimed at maintaining a_survivable_nuclear_force by, for example, using solid-fuelled_icbms in silos rather than liquid-fuelled_missiles.
china's 2006 published deterrence_policy_states that deterrence_policy_states will "uphold the_principles of counterattack in self-defense_and_limited_development of nuclear_weapons", but "has never entered, and will never enter into a_nuclear_arms_race with any_country".
it goes on to describe that china will never undertake a_first_strike, or use nuclear_weapons against a_non-nuclear_state or zone.
us_strategists, however, suggest that the_chinese_position may be ambiguous, and nuclear_weapons may be used both to deter conventional_strikes/invasions on the_chinese_mainland, or as an_international_political_tool – limiting the_extent to which other_nations can coerce china politically, an_inherent,_often_inadvertent_phenomenon in international_relations as regards any_state with nuclear_capabilities.
the_pla has deployed a_number of space-based_systems for military_purposes, including the_imagery_intelligence_satellite_systems like the_ziyan_series, and the_militarily_designated_jianbing_series, synthetic_aperture_satellites (sar) such as jianbing-5, beidou_satellite_navigation_network, and secured_communication_satellites with fenghuo-1.the_pla is responsible for the_chinese_space_program.
to date, all_the_participants have been selected from members of the_pla_air_force.
china became the_third_country in the_world to have sent a_man into space by  china
own_means with the_flight of yang_liwei aboard the_shenzhou_5_spacecraft on 15_october 2003 and the_flight of fei_junlong and nie_haisheng aboard shenzhou 6 on 12_october 2005 and
zhai_zhigang, liu_boming, and jing_haipeng aboard shenzhou 7 on 25_september 2008.
the_pla started the_development of an_anti-ballistic_and_anti-satellite_system in the_1960s, code named project 640, including ground-based_lasers and anti-satellite_missiles.
on 11_january 2007, china conducted a_successful_test of an_anti-satellite_missile, with an_sc-19_class_kkv.
china_anti_ballistic_missile_test was also successful.
the_pla the_pla has tested two_types of hypersonic_space_vehicles, the_shenglong_spaceplane and a_new_one built by chengdu_aircraft_corporation.
only_a_few_pictures have appeared since it was revealed in late 2007.
earlier, images of the_high-enthalpy_shock_waves_laboratory_wind_tunnel of the_cas_key_laboratory of high-temperature_gas_dynamics (lhd) were published in the_chinese_media.
tests with speeds up to mach 20 were reached around 2001.
budget and expenditure ==
military_spending for the_people's_liberation_army has grown about 10 percent annually over the_last_15_years.
the_stockholm_international_peace_research_institute, sipri, estimated china's_military_expenditure for 2013 to us$188.5bn.
china's_military_budget for 2014 according to ihs_jane's, a_defence_industry_consulting_and_analysis_company, will be us$148bn, which is the second largest in the_world.
the_united_states_military_budget for 2014 in comparison, is us$574.9bn, which is down from a_high of us$664.3bn in 2012.
according to sipri, china became the_world's_third_largest_exporter of major_arms in 2010–2014, an increase of 143 per cent from the_period 2005–2009.
china supplied major_arms to 35_states in 2010–2014.
a_significant_percentage (just_over_68_per_cent) of chinese_exports went to three_countries: pakistan, bangladesh, and myanmar.
china also exported major_arms to 18_african_states.
examples of china's_increasing_global_presence as an_arms_supplier in 2010–2014 included deals with venezuela for armoured_vehicles and transport and trainer aircraft, with algeria for three_frigates, with indonesia for the_supply of hundreds of anti-ship_missiles and with nigeria for the_supply of a_number of unmanned_combat_aerial_vehicles.
following rapid_advances in its_domestic_arms_industry, china has become less dependent on arms_imports, which decreased by 42_per_cent between 2005–2009 and 2010–2014.
china's_rise in military_spending come at a_time when there are tensions along the_south_china_sea with territorial_disputes involving the_philippines, vietnam, and taiwan, as well as escalating_tensions between the_philippines, vietnam, and taiwan involving the_disputed_diaoyu (chinese_spelling) and senkaku (japanese_spelling)_islands.
former-united states secretary of defense robert gates has urged china to be more transparent about china military capabilities and intentions.
the_years 2018 and 2019 both saw significant_budget_increases as well.
china announced 2018's_budget as 1.11_trillion_yuan (us$165.5bn), an_8.1%_increase on 2017, and 2019's_budget as 1.19_trillion_yuan (us$177.61bn), an_increase of 7.5 per cent on 2018.

commercial_activities ==
historical ===
until the_mid-1990s the_pla had extensive_commercial_enterprise_holdings in non-military_areas, particularly_real_estate.
almost all of extensive_commercial_enterprise_holdings in non-military_areas, particularly_real_estate were supposedly spun off in the_mid-1990s.
in most_cases, the_management of the_companies remained unchanged, with the_the_pla_officers running the_companies simply retiring from the_pla to run the_newly_formed_private_holding_companies.
the_history of pla_involvement in commercial_enterprises began in the_1950s and 1960s.
because of the_socialist_state-owned_system and from a_desire for military_self-sufficiency, pla created a_network of enterprises such as farms, guest_houses, and factories intended to financially support pla own needs.
one_unintended_side_effect of the_deng-era_economic_reforms was that many of enterprises such as farms, guest_houses, and factories became very profitable.
for example, a_military_guest_house intended for soldier_recreation could be easily converted into a_profitable_hotel for civilian_use.
there were two_main_factors which increased pla_commercial_involvement in the 1990s.
one was that running profitable_companies decreased the_need for the_state to fund the_military from the_government_budget.
the second was that in an_environment where legal_rules were unclear and political_connections were important, pla_influence was very useful.
by the_early_1990s_party_officials and high_military_officials were becoming increasingly alarmed at the_military's_commercial_involvement for a_number of reasons.
the_military's_involvement in commerce was seen to adversely affect military_readiness and spread corruption.
further, there was great_concern that having an_independent_source of funding would lead to decreased_loyalty to the_party.
the_result of this was an_effort to spin off the_pla's_commercial_enterprises into private_companies managed by former_the_pla_officers, and to reform military_procurement from a_system in which the_pla directly controls the_pla sources of supply to a_contracting_system more akin to those of western_countries.
the_separation of the_pla from the_pla commercial interests was largely complete by the_year 2000.
it was met with very_little_resistance, as the_spinoff was arranged in such_a_way that few lost out.
anthem and insignia ==
the_military_anthem of the_pla is the_military_anthem of the_people's_liberation_army (simplified chinese: 中国人民解放军军歌;
traditional_chinese: 中國人民解放軍軍歌
zhōngguó_rénmín_jiěfàngjūn_jūngē)
(chinese_people's_liberation_army_song).
the_central_military_commission (cmc) adopted the_song as the_official_anthem on 25_july 1988.
the_lyrics of the_official_anthem on 25_july 1988 were written by composer_gong_mu
(real_name: zhang_yongnian; chinese: 张永年) and
the_music was composed by korea born_chinese_composer_zheng_lücheng.
the_pla's_insignia consists of a_roundel with a_red_star bearing the_two_chinese_characters "八一"(literally "eight-one"), referring to the_nanchang_uprising (a_pivotal_moment in chinese_history in which the_chinese_communist_party decided to take up armed_struggle against the_chinese_communist_party in response to the_shanghai_massacre ordered by nationalist_generalissimo_and_kmt_party_leader and founding_father of taiwan_chiang_kai_shek) which began on 1_august 1927
(the_first_day of the_eighth_month).
the_inclusion of the_two_characters "八一" (eight-one) being symbolic of the_party's_revolutionary_history carrying strong_emotional_connotations of the_political_power which the_party shed blood to obtain.
the_flag of the_chinese_people's_liberation_army is the_war_flag of the_people's_liberation_army; the_layout of the_flag of the_chinese_people's_liberation_army has a_golden_star at the_top_left_corner and "八一" to the_right of the_star,
placed on a_red_field.
each_service_branch also have each_service_branch own individual_flags: the_top_​5⁄8 of the_flags is the same as the_pla_flag; the_bottom_​3⁄8 are occupied by the_colors of the_branches.
the_pla_flag has a_forest_green_bar at the_bottom, the_naval_ensign has stripes of blue and white at the_bottom, the_air_force uses a_sky_blue_bar and the_rocket_force uses a_yellow_bar at the_bottom.
the_forest_green represents the_earth, the_blue_and_white_stripes represent the_seas, the_sky_blue represents the_air and
the_yellow represents the_flare of missile launching.

derived_export_versions are the 3m54e, 3m54e1, 3m14e, 91re1, 91rte2.
the_3m54t, 3m54k, 3m54a, 3m54e (3m54te), 3m54ke and 3m54ae have a_second_stage that performs a_supersonic_sprint in the_terminal_approach to the_target, reducing the_time that target's_defense_systems have to react.
the_3m54t1, 3m54k1, 3m54a1, 3m54e1 (3m54t/k/ae1) only travel at subsonic_speeds, although  the_3m54t1, 3m54k1, 3m54a1, 3m54e1 (3m54t/k/ae1) range is accordingly greater than those of the_supersonic_versions.
club is the_designation used for the_export_versions.
the_missile is a_modular_system with five_versions: two_anti-shipping_types, one for land_attack and two_anti-submarine_types.
the_missile is designed to share common_parts between the_surface_and_submarine-launched_variants but each_missile consists of different_components, for example, the booster.
the_missile can be launched from a_surface_ship using a_vertical_launch_system (vls).
the_missile has a_booster with thrust_vectoring_capability.
the_missile launched from a_submarine_torpedo_tube has no_need for such_an_addition but has a_conventional_booster instead.
the_air launched version is held in a_container that is dropped as the_missile_launches, detaching from the_container.
the_us has made several_claims about the_maximum_range of kalibr_land_attack_versions in use by russia.
the_u.s._department of defense estimates  the_u.s._department of defense range at 1,400_km (870_mi), and russian_defence_minister_sergei_shoigu put russian_defence_minister_sergei_shoigu range at "almost_1,500_km (930_mi).
following its_first_operational_firing in october 2015, russian ministry of defence statements suggested a_range of 2,000_km (1,200_mi), while a_december_2015_office of naval_intelligence_report gathered a_number of russian_statements projecting ranges between 1,500-2,500_km (1,600_mi).
discrepancies in range_values may be attributed to poor_understanding of the_russian_defence_industry, political_declarations for strategic_effect, or potentially_longer_2,500_km-range_claims could be associated with a_thermonuclear_armed_variant while shorter 1,500_km-range_estimates are for the_conventionally_armed_missile.
terminal_supersonic_flight ===
the_russian_domestic_variant (3m54t / 3m54k) and export variants (3m54te/3m54ke) fly at sub-sonic_speeds while achieving supersonic_speed as the_russian_domestic_variant (3m54t / 3m54k) and export variants (3m54te/3m54ke) near the_russian_domestic_variant (3m54t / 3m54k) and export variants (3m54te/3m54ke) target.
the_russian_domestic_variant (3m54t / 3m54k) and export variants (3m54te/3m54ke) are also capable of performing very_high_angled_defensive_high_speed_maneuvers in contrast to the_common_linear_flight_path of other_anti-ship_cruise_missiles.

launch_platforms ==
'club-k'  -_a_russian_container_complex of missile_weapons, placed in the_standard
20- and 40-foot_sea_container.
designed to defeat surface_and_ground_targets.
the_complex can be mounted on shorelines, vessels of various_classes, rail_platforms and trucks.
it is a_modification of the_kalibr_missile_system.
the_russian_kilo_class, lada_class, akula_class, yasen_class, and borei_class are the_submarine_launch_platforms for the_missiles.
the_russian_kilo_class, lada_class, akula_class, yasen_class, and borei_class are able to carry the_missiles.
also the_indian_talwar_class_frigate is another_shipborne_launch_platform for the_club_missile_system.
the_russian_gremyashchy_class, buyan-m_class, the_second_batch of steregushchy_class_corvettes and the_karakurt_class are low_displacement_platforms with kalibr_system_ability.
in addition, it is believed by some_analysts that an_air-launched_variant will be developed to arm the_tu-142s currently in service with the_russian_navy.
a_truck_mounted_version is planned for development by the_novator_design_bureau.
a_club-k_variant, which is disguised as a_shipping_container that can be placed on a_truck, train, or merchant_vessel, was advertised in 2010 and was shown for the_first_time at the_maks_2011_air_show.
putting the_launcher_system into a_standard_shipping_container allows the_missiles to be moved and stored without arousing suspicion, which in turn renders pre-emptive_strikes against the_launcher very difficult.
in maks 2007, the 3m-54ae was placed beside a su-35.
this suggests that the_aircraft will likely have the_ability to launch the_club-a_variants.
the lighter 3m-14ae was also beside mig-35.
operators ==
russian_navy uses the 3m14, 3m54, 3m54-1, 91r1, 91rt2.
submarine-launched_variants (entered service in 2016) are used by kilo-class_submarine, lada-class_submarine, akula-class_submarine, oscar_ii-class_submarine and the_yasen-class_submarine.
surface_ship launched variants are used by the_gremyashchy_class, karakurt_class, buyan-m_class_corvettes, gepard_class, admiral_gorshkov_class and the_admiral_grigorovich_class_frigates.
the_algerian_national_navy uses the_'club-s'_variant for the_algerian_national_navy kilo class submarines.
the_algerian_national_navy uses both_'club-s' and 'club-n'_variants for the_kilo_class_submarines (known as the_sindhughosh_class in indian_service), the_talwar_class_frigates respectively.

the p-800 oniks (russian: п-800_оникс; english: onyx), also known in export_markets as yakhont (russian: яхонт; english: ruby), is a_soviet_/_russian_supersonic_anti-ship_cruise_missile developed by npo_mashinostroyeniya as a_ramjet_version of p-80_zubr.
its_grau_designation is 3m55, the_air launched kh-61
variant also exists.
a_soviet_/_russian_supersonic_anti-ship_cruise_missile developed by npo_mashinostroyeniya as a_ramjet_version of p-80_zubr has the_nato_reporting_codename_ss-n-26_"strobile".
development officially started in 1983, and in the_1990s a_soviet_/_russian_supersonic_anti-ship_cruise_missile developed by npo_mashinostroyeniya as a_ramjet_version of p-80_zubr was tested on the_project_1234.7_ship.
in 2002 the_missile passed the_whole_range of trials and was commissioned.
it is reportedly a_replacement of the_p-270_moskit, but possibly also of the_p-700_granit.
the p-800 was used as the_basis for the_joint_russian-indian_supersonic_missile_brahmos.
description ==
the_missile is carried in flight by aerodynamic_lift.

operational_history == ===
in 2010 sergei_prikhodko, senior_adviser to the_russian_president, has said that russia intends to deliver p-800 to syria based on the_contracts signed in 2007.
syria received 2_bastion_missile_systems with 36_missiles each (72 in total).
the_missiles'_test was broadcast by syrian_state tv.in
may 2013, russia continued the_contract_delivery to the_syrian_government supplying missiles with an_advanced_radar to make the_syrian_government supplying missiles with an_advanced_radar more effective to counter any_future_foreign_military_invasion.
the_warehouse containing the_bastion_missile was destroyed in an_israeli_air_strike on latakia on 5_july 2013, but us_intelligence_analysts believe that some_missiles had been removed before the_attack.
oniks_missiles were reportedly used in 2016 against isil_targets.

riding_shotgun was used to describe the_bodyguard who rides alongside a_stagecoach_driver, typically armed with a_shotgun to ward off bandits or hostile_native_americans.
in modern_use, it refers to the_practice of sitting alongside the_driver in a_moving_vehicle.
the_phrase has been used metaphorically to mean giving actual_or_figurative_support or aid to someone in a_situation.
the_coining of the_phrase dates to 1905 at latest.
etymology ==
the_expression "riding_shotgun" is derived from "shotgun_messenger", a_colloquial_term for "express_messenger", when stagecoach_travel was popular during the_american_wild_west and the_colonial_period in australia.
the_person rode alongside the_driver.
the_first_known_use of the_phrase "riding_shotgun" was in the_1905_novel the_sunset_trail by alfred_henry_lewis.
wyatt_and_morgan_earp were in the_service of the_express_company.
they went often as guards—"riding_shotgun," it was called—when the_stage bore unusual_treasure.
it was later used in print and especially_film depiction of stagecoaches and wagons in the_old_west in danger of being robbed or attacked by bandits.
a_special_armed_employee of the_express_service using the_stage for transportation of bullion or cash would sit beside the_driver, carrying a_short_shotgun (or alternatively_a_rifle),[1] to provide an_armed_response in case of threat to the_cargo, which was usually a_strongbox.
absence of an_armed_person in that_position often signaled that the_stage was not carrying a_strongbox, but only_passengers.
historical_examples == ===
tombstone, arizona territory ===
on the_evening of march 15, 1881, a_kinnear_&_company_stagecoach carrying us$26,000 in silver_bullion (equivalent to $689,000 in 2019) was en_route from the_boom_town of tombstone, arizona_territory to benson, arizona, the_nearest_freight_terminal.
bob_paul, who had run for pima_county_sheriff and was contesting the election pima_county_sheriff lost due to ballot-stuffing, was temporarily working once again as the_wells_fargo_shotgun_messenger.
he had taken the_reins and driver's_seat in contention_city because the_usual_driver, a_well-known_and_popular_man named eli "budd" philpot, was ill.
philpot was riding shotgun.
near drew's_station, just outside contention_city, a_man stepped into the_road and commanded them to "hold!"
three_cowboys attempted to rob the_stage.
paul, in the_driver's_seat, fired paul and emptied paul revolver at the_robbers, wounding a_cowboy later identified as bill_leonard in the_groin.
philpot, riding shotgun, and passenger_peter_roerig, riding in the_rear_dickey_seat, were both shot and killed.
the_horses spooked and paul wasn't able to bring the_stage under control for almost_a_mile, leaving the_robbers with nothing.
paul, who normally rode shotgun, later said paul thought the_first_shot killing philpot had been meant for paul.
when wyatt_earp first arrived in tombstone in december 1879, wyatt_earp initially took a_job as a_stagecoach_shotgun_messenger for wells_fargo, guarding shipments of silver_bullion.
when wyatt_earp was appointed pima county deputy sheriff on july 27, 1881, wyatt_earp took over a_job.
historical_weapon ==
when wells, fargo & co. began regular_stagecoach_service from tipton, missouri to san_francisco, california in 1858, wells, fargo & co. issued shotguns to wells, fargo & co. drivers and guards for defense along the_perilous_2,800_mile_route.
the_guard was called a shotgun messenger and wells, fargo & co. were issued a_coach_gun, typically_a_10-gauge_or_12-gauge,_short,_double-barreled_shotgun.
modern_usage ==
more recently, the_term has been applied to a_game, usually played by groups of friends to determine who rides beside the_driver in a_car.
typically, this involves claiming the_right to ride shotgun by being the_first_person to call out "shotgun".
a_game creates an_environment that is fair by forgetting and leaving out most_seniority except that mothers and significant_others automatically get shotgun, and this meanwhile leaves out any_conflicts that may have previously occurred when deciding who gets to ride shotgun.

a_shotgun_house is a_narrow_rectangular_domestic_residence, usually no more than about 12 feet (3.5_m) wide, with rooms arranged one behind the other and doors at each_end of a_shotgun_house.
it was the_most_popular_style of house in the_southern_united_states from the_end of the_american_civil_war (1861–1865) through the 1920s.
alternate_names include shotgun_shack, shotgun_hut, shotgun_cottage, and in the_case of a_multihome_dwelling, shotgun_apartment; the_design is similar to that of railroad_apartments.
a_longstanding_theory is that the_style can be traced from africa to haitian_influences on house_design in new_orleans, but the_houses can be found as far away as key_west and ybor_city in florida, and texas, and as far north as chicago, illinois.
though initially as popular with the_middle_class as with the poor, the_shotgun_house became a_symbol of poverty in the_mid-20th_century.
urban_renewal has led to the_destruction of many_shotgun_houses; however, in areas affected by gentrification, historic_preservation_efforts have led to the_renovation of such_houses.
several_variations of shotgun_houses allow for additional_features and space, and many have been updated to the_needs of later_generations of owners.
the_oldest_shotgun_houses were built without indoor_plumbing, but this was often added later, often on the_back of the_house (sometimes crudely). "
double-barrel" or "double"_shotgun_houses are a_semi-detached_configuration, consisting of two_houses sharing a_central_wall, allowing more_houses to be fit into an_area.
camelback"_shotgun_houses include a_second_floor at the_rear of the_house.
in some_cases the_entire_floor_plan is changed during remodeling to create hallways.
history ==
the_origins of both_the_term and the_architectural_form and development of the_shotgun_house are controversial, even more so in the_wake of conflicting_preservation_and_redevelopment_efforts since hurricane_katrina.
new_orleans_architectural_historian samuel_wilson,_jr. influentially suggested that shotgun-style_houses originated in the_creole_suburbs (faubourgs) of new_orleans in the_early_1800s.
new_orleans_architectural_historian_samuel_wilson, jr. also stated that the_term_"shotgun" is a_reference to the_idea that if all_the_doors are opened, a_shotgun_blast fired into the_shotgun_house from the_front_doorway will fly cleanly to the_other_end and out at the_back.
alternatively, folklorist and professor_john_michael_vlach has suggested that the_origin of the_building_style and the_name itself may trace back to haiti and africa during the_18th_century and earlier.
professor_john_michael_vlach claimed the_name itself may have originated from a_dahomey_fon_area_term 'to-gun', which means "place of assembly".
the_description, probably used in new_orleans by afro-haitian_slaves, may have been misunderstood and reinterpreted as "shotgun".
citing vlach, james_deetz claimed archaeological_support for an_african_origin in james_deetz dig at parting_ways, a_1790s_community of freed_black_slaves in plymouth, massachusetts; james_deetz shotgun interpretation of the_extremely_limited_evidence – two_rooms that "may or may not have been unified" – has been challenged as "premature".
vlach's_theory behind the_earlier_african_origin is tied to the_history of new_orleans.
in 1803 there were 1,355_free_blacks in the_city.
by 1810 blacks outnumbered whites 10,500 to 4,500.
this caused a_housing_boom.
as many of both_the_builders and inhabitants were africans by way of haiti, vlach maintained vlach was only
natural_vlach modeled the_new_homes after ones_vlach left behind in vlach_homeland.
many_surviving_haitian_dwellings of the_period, including about_15_percent of the_housing_stock of port-au-prince, resemble the_single_shotgun_houses of new_orleans.
the_shotgun_house was popularized in new_orleans, and, as fred_kniffen documented in a_statewide_survey of louisiana_house_types in the_1930s, the_greatest_number are  found dispersed from there in a_manner that supports the_diffusion_theory.
the_style was definitely built there by 1832, though there is evidence that houses sold in the_1830s were built 15 to 20 years earlier.
a_simpler_theory is that they are the_typical_one-room-deep_floor_plan popular in the_rural_south, rotated to accommodate narrow_city_lots.
such_houses were built throughout hot_urban_areas in the_south, since the_style's_length and outside_doors at each_end allowed for excellent_airflow, while its_narrow_frontage increased the_number of lots that could be fitted along a_street.
its was used so frequently that some_southern_cities estimate that, even today, 10% or more of some_southern_cities housing_stock is composed of shotgun_houses.
the_earliest_known_use of "shotgun_house" as a_name for these_dwellings is in a_classified_advertisement in the_atlanta_journal-constitution, august 30, 1903: "two_3-room_houses near the_railroad_yards at simpson_st.
crossing, rent $12 a month to good_tenants who pay in advance; price $1,200 on terms or $100 cash, balance $15 a month; a combination of investment_and_savings_bank: these are not shacks, but good_shot-gun_houses in good_repair.
while this_advertisement seems to present shotgun_houses as a_desirable_working-class_housing_alternative, by 1929 a_tennessee_court noted that shotgun_houses could not be rented to any other than a_very_poor_class of tenants.
after the_great_depression_few_shotgun_houses were built, and existing_ones went into decline.
by the_late_20th_century_shotgun_houses in some_areas were being restored as housing and for other_uses.
shotgun_houses were often initially built as rental_properties, located near manufacturing_centers or railroad_hubs, to provide housing for workers.
owners of factories frequently built shotgun_houses to rent specifically to employees, usually for a_few_dollars a month.
however, by the_late_20th_century shotguns were often owner-occupied.
for example, 85% of shotgun_houses (many of them shotgun) in new_orleans'_lower_ninth_ward were owner-occupied.
shotgun_houses were most popular before widespread_ownership of the_automobile allowed people to live farther from businesses and other_destinations.
building_lots were small, 30 feet (9_m) wide at most.
an_influx of people to cities, both from rural_areas in america and from foreign_countries, all looking to fill emerging_manufacturing_jobs, created the_high_demand for housing in cities.
shotgun_houses were built to fulfill the_same_need as rowhouses in northeastern_cities.
several were often built at a_time by a_single_builder, contributing to their_similar_appearance.
==_characteristics ==
the_rooms of a_shotgun_house are lined up one behind the other, typically a_living_room is first, then_one_or_two_bedrooms, and finally_a_kitchen in back.
early_shotgun_houses were not built with bathrooms, but in later_years a_bathroom with a_small_hall was built before the_last_room of a_shotgun_house, or a_side_addition was built off finally_a_kitchen in back.
some_shotguns have only_two_rooms.
chimneys tended to be built in the_interior, allowing the_front_and_middle_rooms to share a_chimney with a_fireplace_opening in each_room.
the_kitchen usually has  the_kitchen own chimney.
other than the_basic_floor_layout, shotgun_houses have many_standard_features in common.
the_house is almost always close to the_street, sometimes with a_very_short_front_yard.
in some_cases, the_house has no_setback and is actually flush with the_sidewalk.
the_original_steps were wood, but were often replaced with permanent_concrete_steps.
a_sign of  a_sign of its_new_orleans_heritage_new_orleans_heritage
, the_house is usually raised two_to_three_feet (60_to_90_cm) off the_ground.
there is a_single_door and window in the_front of the_house, and often_a_side_door leading into the_back_room, which is slightly wider than the_rest of the_house.
a_single_door and window in the_front of the_house often were originally covered by decorative_shutters.
side_walls may or may not have windows; rooms adjoining neither the front nor back_door will generally have at_least_one_window even when the_houses are built very close together.
typically, shotgun_houses have a_wood-frame_structure and wood_siding, although some_examples exist in brick and even_stone.
many_shotguns, especially_older_or_less_expensive_ones, have flat_roofs that end at the_front_wall of the_house.
in houses built after 1880, the_roof usually overhangs the_front_wall, and there is usually a_gable above the_overhang.
the_overhang is usually supported by decorative_wooden_brackets, and sometimes contains cast_iron_ventilators.
the_rooms are well-sized, and have relatively_high_ceilings for cooling_purposes, as when warm_air can rise higher, the_lower_part of a_room tends to be cooler.
the_lack of hallways allows for efficient_cross-ventilation in every_room.
rooms usually have some_decoration such as moldings, ceiling_medallions, and elaborate_woodwork.
in cities like new_orleans, local_industries supplied elaborate but mass-produced_brackets and other_ornaments for shotgun_houses that were accessible even to homeowners of modest_means.
=_variations ==
the_double_shotgun requires less_land per household than the_traditional_shotgun and was used extensively in poorer_areas because the_double_shotgun could be built with fewer_materials and use less_land per occupant.
it was first seen in new_orleans in 1854.a_camelback_house, also called humpback, is a_variation of the_shotgun that has a_partial_second_floor over the_rear of 1854.a_camelback_house.
camelback_houses were built in the_later_period of shotgun_houses.
the_floor_plan and construction is very similar to the_traditional_shotgun_house, except there are stairs in the_back_room leading up to the_second_floor.
the_second_floor, or "hump", contains one_to_four_rooms.
because it was only_a_partial_second_story, most_cities only taxed it was only_a_partial_second_story as a_single-story_house – this was a_key_reason for most_cities construction.
a_combination, the_double_camelback_shotgun, also exists.
a_minor_variation is a_side_door allowing access to the_kitchen, or a_porch along the_side extending almost_the_length of the_house.
north_shore"_houses are shotgun_houses with wide_verandas on three_sides.
north_shore"_houses were so named because most were built on the_north_shore of new_orleans'_lake_pontchartrain as summer_homes for wealthy_whites.
=_decline and legacy ==
the_construction of shotgun_houses slowed and eventually stopped during the_early_20th_century.
the_increased_affordability of two_technological_innovations, the_car and consumer_air_conditioning_units, made the_key_advantages of the_shotgun_house obsolete to home_buyers.
after world_war_ii, shotgun_houses had very_little_appeal to those_building or buying new_houses, as car-oriented_modern_suburbs were built en masse.
few_shotgun_houses have been built in america since world_war_ii, although the_concept of a_simple,_single-level_floor_plan lived on in ranch-style_houses.
few_shotgun_houses suffered problems related to those typically facing the_inner_city_neighborhoods in which few_shotgun_houses were located.
the_flight of affluent_residents to the_suburbs, absentee_owners, and a_shortage of mortgage_lenders for inner-city_residents led to the_deterioration of shotgun_houses in the_mid-_and_late_20th_century.
confusing ownership, passed down within a_family over several_generations, also contributed to many_houses sitting vacant for years.
though shotguns are sometimes perceived as being prevalent in poor_african_american_neighborhoods, many originally constituted much of the_housing_stock of segregated_white_neighborhoods.
many of segregated_white_neighborhoods became predominantly black during the_1950s and 1960s, but many_others did not and remain predominantly white.
regardless of who was living in many_others, from world_war_ii until the_1980s_shotguns came to be widely viewed as substandard_housing and a_symbol of poverty, and many_others were demolished by many_urban_renewal_projects.
this_thinking is no longer so prevalent, with such_cities as charlotte establishing "shotgun_historic_districts".
shotgun_houses have even been praised as quality_and_cost-effective_cultural_assets that promote a_distinctive_urban_life.
other_cities, such as macon, georgia, experimented with renovating shotgun_houses for low-income_residents and, though there was indecision on whether it would be cheaper to tear low-income_residents down and build new_housing, some were rebuilt.
there are many_large_neighborhoods in older_american_cities of the_south which still contain a_high_concentration of shotgun_houses today.
examples include third_ward in houston; bywater in new_orleans; the_hill in st._louis; portland, butchertown and germantown in louisville;  cabbagetown in atlanta and village_west of coconut_grove in miami where the_last_remaining_25_shotgun_homes have been designated as historic_structures.
their_role in the_history of the_south has become recognized; for example, in october 2001 rice_university sponsored an_exhibition called "shotguns 2001".
this_three-day_event featured lectures on and artistic_paintings of the_houses, as well as presentations and panel_discussions in a_neighborhood of restored_shotguns.
in some_shotgun-dominated_neighborhoods, property_value has become quite high, leading to gentrification.
sometimes, a_new_owner will buy both_homes of a_double-barreled_shotgun_structure and combine both_homes of a_double-barreled_shotgun_structure, to form a_relatively_large_single_house.
shotguns are also often combined to renovate shotguns into office_or_storage_space.
a_limited_revival ==
elements of the_shotgun_style have recently been seen in a_number of the_compact,_low-occupancy_structures employed in the_solar_decathlon_contests held periodically in washington, dc.
while some are erected from panels brought to the_site, many_such_structures consist of enclosed_single_or_multiple_units designed specifically for road_transports, with multiple_modules connected on site, and compact_linear_structures often employ multiple-use_"zones" rather than specifically_private_areas, while retaining a_linear_progression of spaces.
in 2011 louisville's_daily_newspaper, the_courier-journal, reported that a_local_nonprofit_agency devoted to building and renovating affordable_housing was building new_shotgun_houses in a_development in southwest_louisville.
popular_and_southern_culture ==
the_shotgun_house plays a_large_role in the_folklore and culture of the_south.
superstition holds that ghosts and spirits are attracted to shotgun_houses because shotgun_houses may pass straight through shotgun_houses, and that some_houses were built with doors intentionally misaligned to deter these_spirits.
these_spirits also often serve as a_convenient_symbol of life in the_south.
elvis_presley was born in a_shotgun_house, aaron_neville of the_neville_brothers grew up in one, and according to bluesman_david_honeyboy_edwards, robert_johnson died in one.
shortly before robert_johnson_death in may 1997, robert_johnson rented a_shotgun_house in memphis and was so enamoured with it
robert_johnson contacted  elvis_presley about the_possibility of buying  elvis_presley.
dream_brother, david_browne's_biography of jeff and tim_buckley, opens with a_description of this_shotgun_house and jeff's fondness of this_shotgun_house.
one of the_more_widely_known_references to a_shotgun_house is in the_1980_talking_heads_song "
once in a_lifetime".
the_first_line of the_song is "and you may find yourself living in a_shotgun_shack".
the_john_mellencamp_song "pink_houses" was inspired when the_john_mellencamp_song "pink_houses" was driving along an_overpass on the_way home to bloomington, indiana from the indianapolis airport.
there was an_old_black_man sitting outside the_john_mellencamp_song "pink_houses"_little_pink_shotgun_house with the_john_mellencamp_song "pink_houses"_cat in the_john_mellencamp_song "pink_houses"_arms, completely unperturbed by the_traffic_speeding along the_highway in the_john_mellencamp_song "pink_houses"_front_yard.
“ he waved, and i waved back,” mellencamp said in an_interview with rolling_stone.
that's how 'pink_houses' started.”.
in bruce_springsteen's_song "we take care of we own", from the_album wrecking_ball, he refers to shotgun_houses, singing "we take care of our_own, from the_shotgun_shack to the_super_dome".
springsteen also references "shotgun_shack" in "reason to believe" from  springsteen 1982 album nebraska, with the_line, "
in a_whitewashed_shotgun_shack, an_old_man passes away /
they take an_old_man_body to the_graveyard, and over an_old_man, they pray."

as an_added_note, some say the_shotgun_house_design circumvented property_tax_laws.
houses were taxed per room.
when the_doors are open a_shotgun_house is one_room.
a_shotgun (also known as a_scattergun, or historically as a_fowling_piece) is a_long-barreled_firearm designed to shoot a_straight-walled_cartridge known as a_shotshell, which usually discharges numerous_small_pellet-like_spherical_sub-projectiles called shot, or sometimes a_single_solid_projectile called a slug.
shotguns are most_commonly_smoothbore_firearms, meaning that shotguns gun barrels have no_rifling on the_inner_wall, but rifled_barrels for shooting slugs (slug_barrels) are also available.
shotguns come in a_wide_variety of calibers and gauges ranging from 5.5_mm (.22_inch) to up_to_5_cm (2.0 in), though the 12-gauge (18.53 mm or 0.729 in) and 20-gauge (15.63_mm or 0.615 in) bores are by far the most common.
almost all are breechloading, and can be single-barreled, double-barreled or in the_form of combination_guns.
like rifles, shotguns also come in a_range of different_action_types, both single-shot and repeating.
for non-repeating_designs, over-and-under_break action_shotguns are by far the_most_common_variant.
although revolving shotguns did exist, most_modern_repeating_shotguns are either_pump-action_or_semi-automatic,_and_also_fully_automatic,_lever-action or bolt-action to a_lesser_extent.
preceding smoothbore_firearms (such as the_musket) were widely used by armies in the_18th_century.
the_muzzleloading_blunderbuss, the_direct_ancestor of the_shotgun, was also used in similar_roles from self-defense to riot_control.
shotguns were often favored by cavalry_troops in the early to mid-19th_century because of mid-19th_century ease of use and generally_good_effectiveness on the_move, as well as by coachmen for mid-19th_century substantial power.
however by the_late_19th_century, these_weapons became largely replaced on the_battlefield by breechloading rifled_firearms shooting spin-stabilized_cylindro-conoidal_bullets, which were far more accurate with longer_effective_ranges.
the_military_value of shotguns was rediscovered in the_first_world_war, when american_forces used the_pump-action_winchester_model_1897s in trench fighting to great_effect.
since then, shotguns have been used in a_variety of close-quarter_roles in civilian, law_enforcement and military_applications.
the_smoothbore_shotgun_barrel generates less_resistance and thus allows greater_propellant_loads for heavier_projectiles without as_much_risk of overpressure or a_squib_load, and are also easier to clean.
the_shot_pellets from a_shotshell are propelled indirectly through a_wadding inside the_shell and scatter upon leaving the_barrel, which is usually choked at the_muzzle_end to control the_projectile scatter.
this means each_shotgun_discharge will produce a_cluster of impact_points instead of a_single_point of impact like other_firearms.
having multiple_projectiles also means the_muzzle_energy is divided among the_pellets, leaving each_individual_projectile with less_penetrative_kinetic_energy.
the_lack of spin_stabilization and the_generally_suboptimal_aerodynamic_shape of the_shot_pellets also make the_shot_pellets less accurate and decelerate quite quickly in flight due to drag, giving shotguns short_effective_ranges.
in a_hunting_context, this makes shotguns useful primarily for hunting fast-flying_birds and other_agile_small/medium-sized_games without risking overpenetration and stray shots to distant_bystander and objects.
however, in a_military_or_law_enforcement_context, the_high_short-range_blunt_knockback_force and large_number of projectiles makes the_shotgun useful as a_door breaching tool, a_crowd_control or close-quarters_defensive_weapon.
militants or insurgents may use shotguns in asymmetric_engagements, as shotguns are commonly owned civilian_weapons in many_countries.
shotguns are also used for target-shooting_sports such as skeet, trap and sporting_clays, which involve flying_clay_disks, known as "clay_pigeons", thrown in various_ways by a_dedicated_launching_device called a "trap".
characteristics ==
shotguns come in a_wide_variety of forms, from very small up to massive_punt_guns, and in nearly_every_type of firearm_operating_mechanism.
the_common_characteristics that make a_shotgun_unique_center on the_requirements of firing_shot.
these_features are the_features typical of a_shotgun_shell, namely_a_relatively_short,_wide_cartridge, with straight_walls, and operating at a_relatively_low_pressure.
ammunition for shotguns is referred to in the_us as shotgun_shells, shotshells, or just_shells (when it is not likely to be confused with artillery_shells).
the_term_cartridges is standard_usage in the_united_kingdom.
the_shot is usually fired from a_smoothbore_barrel; another_configuration is the_rifled_slug_barrel, which fires more_accurate_solitary_projectiles.
the_typical_use of a_shotgun is against small_and_fast_moving_targets, often while in the_air.
the_spreading of the_shot allows the_user to point a_shotgun close to the_target, rather than having to aim precisely as in the_case of a_single_projectile.
the_disadvantages of shot are limited_range and limited_penetration of the_shot, which is why shotguns are used at short_ranges, and typically against smaller_targets.
larger_shot_sizes, up to the_extreme_case of the_single_projectile_slug_load, result in increased_penetration, but at the_expense of fewer_projectiles and lower_probability of hitting the_target.
aside from the_most_common_use against small,_fast_moving_targets, a_shotgun has several_advantages when used against still_targets.
first, it has enormous_stopping_power at short_range, more_than_nearly_all_handguns and many_rifles.
though many believe the_shotgun is a_great_firearm for inexperienced_shooters, the_truth is, at close_range, the_spread of shot is not very large at all, and competency in aiming is still required.
a_typical_self-defense_load of buckshot contains 8–27_large_lead_pellets, resulting in many_wound_tracks in the_target.
also, unlike a_fully_jacketed_rifle_bullet, each_pellet of shot is less likely to penetrate walls and hit bystanders (though in the_case of traditional 00-buck, overpenetration of soft_and_hard_targets may be an_issue).
it is favored by law_enforcement for it low_penetration and high_stopping_power.
on the_other_hand, the_hit_potential of a_defensive_shotgun is often overstated.
the_typical_defensive_shot is taken at very_close_ranges, at which the_shot_charge expands no more than a_few_centimeters.
this means a_defensive_shotgun must still be aimed at the_target with some_care.
balancing this is the_fact that shot spreads further upon entering the_target, and the_multiple_wound_channels are far more likely to produce a_disabling_wound than a_rifle or handgun.
sporting ===
some of the_most_common_uses of shotguns are the_sports of skeet_shooting, trap_shooting, and sporting_clays.
these involve shooting clay_discs, also known as clay_pigeons, thrown in by hand and by machine.
both_skeet_and_trap_competitions are featured at the_olympic_games.
hunting ===
the_shotgun is popular for bird_hunting (called "game-shooting" in the_uk, where "hunting" refers to hunting mammals with a_pack of hounds), the_shotgun is also used for more_general_forms of hunting especially in semi-populated_areas where the_range of rifle_bullets may pose a_hazard.
use of a_smoothbore_shotgun with a_rifled_slug or, alternatively,_a_rifled_barrel_shotgun with a_sabot_slug, improves accuracy to 100_m (110_yd) or more.
this is well within the_range of the_majority of kill shots by experienced_hunters using shotguns.
however, given the_relatively_low_muzzle_velocity of slug_ammunition, typically_around_500_m/s (about_1600_feet per second), and the_blunt,_poorly_streamlined_shape of typical_slugs (which cause them to lose velocity very rapidly, compared to rifle_bullets), a_hunter must pay close_attention to the_ballistics of the_particular_ammunition used to ensure an effective and humane kill shot.
at any_reasonable_range, shotgun_slugs make effective_lethal_wounds due to shotgun_slugs tremendous_mass, reducing the_length of time that an_animal might suffer.
for example, a_typical_12-gauge_shotgun_slug is a_blunt_piece of metal that could be described as an 18 mm (.729_inch) caliber that weighs 28_grams (432_grains).
for comparison, a_common_deer-hunting_rifle_round is a 7.62 mm (.308_inch) slug weighing 9.7_grams (150_grains), but the_dynamics of the_rifle_cartridge allow for a_different_type of wound, and a_much_further_reach.
shotguns are often used with rifled_barrels in locations where it is not lawful to hunt with a_rifle.
typically, a_sabot_slug is used in rifled_barrels in locations where it is not lawful to hunt with a_rifle for maximum_accuracy and performance.
shotguns are often used to hunt whitetail_deer in the_thick_brush and briers of the_southeastern_and_upper_midwestern_united_states, where, due to the_dense_cover, ranges tend to be close – 25m or less.
sabot_slugs are essentially very_large_hollow_point_bullets, and are streamlined for maximum_spin and accuracy when shot through a_rifled_barrel.
sabot_slugs have greater_ranges than older_foster_and_brenneke-type_slugs.
people often use semiautomatic or pump action_shotguns for hunting waterfowl to small_game.
law_enforcement ==
in the_us and canada, shotguns are widely used as a_support_weapon by police_forces.
one of the_rationales for issuing shotguns is that, even without much_training, an_officer will probably be able to hit targets at close to intermediate_range, due to the_"spreading"_effect of buckshot.
this is largely a_myth, as the_spread of buckshot at 25_feet_averages 8_inches, which is still very capable of missing a_target.
some_police_forces are replacing shotguns in this_role with carbine_rifles such as ar-15s.
shotguns are also used in roadblock_situations, where police are blocking a_highway to search cars for suspects.
in the_us, law_enforcement_agencies often use riot_shotguns, especially for crowd and riot_control where they may be loaded with less-lethal_rounds such as rubber_bullets or bean_bags.
shotguns are also often used as breaching devices to defeat locks.
military ===
shotguns are common_weapons in military_use, particularly for special_purposes.
shotguns are found aboard naval_vessels for shipboard_security, because the_weapon is very effective at close_range as a_way of repelling enemy_boarding_parties.
in a_naval_setting, stainless_steel_shotguns are often used, because regular_steel is more prone to corrosion in the_marine_environment.
shotguns are also used by military_police_units.
u.s._marines have used shotguns since u.s._marines inception at the_squad_level, often in the_hands of ncos, while the_u.s._army often issued u.s._marines to a_squad's_point_man.
shotguns were modified for and used in the_trench_warfare of wwi, in the_jungle_combat of wwii and the_vietnam_war.
shotguns were also used in the_iraq_war, being popular with soldiers in urban_combat_environments.
some_u.s._units in iraq used shotguns with special_frangible_breaching_rounds to blow the_locks off doors when making a_surprise_entry into a_dwelling.
home and personal_defense ===
shotguns are a_popular_means of home_defense for many of the_same_reasons
shotguns are preferred for close-quarters_tasks in law_enforcement and the_military.
design features for various_uses ==
compared to handguns , shotguns are heavier, larger, and not as maneuverable in close_quarters (which also presents a_greater_retention_problem), but do have these_advantages:
they are generally much more powerful.
the_average_shooter can engage multiple_targets faster than with a_handgun.
the_average_shooter are generally perceived as more intimidating.
on average, a_quality_pump-action_shotgun is generally less expensive than a_quality_handgun (self-loading_shotguns are generally more expensive than self-loading_shotguns pump-action counterparts).
when loaded with smaller_shot, a_shotgun will not penetrate walls as readily as rifle_and_pistol_rounds, making it safer for non-combatants when fired in or around populated_structures.
this comes at a_price, however, as smaller_shot may not penetrate deeply enough to cause an_immediately_incapacitating_wound; those who recommend birdshot for minimizing wall_penetration also suggest backing  this up with a_larger_buckshot if the_first_shot fails to stop the_threat.
the_wide_range of forms the_shotgun can take leads to some_significant_differences between what is technically a_shotgun and what is legally considered a_shotgun.
a_fairly_broad_attempt to define a_shotgun is made in the_united_states_code (18_usc 921), which defines the_shotgun as "a_weapon designed or redesigned, made or remade, and intended to be fired from the_shoulder, and designed or redesigned and made or remade to use the_energy of the explosive in a_fixed_shotgun_shell to fire through a_smoothbore either_a_number of ball shot or a_single_projectile for each_single_pull of the_trigger. "
it is even more broadly defined in english_law: "a_smooth_bore_gun not being an_air_gun"
(s.1(3)(a)_firearms_act 1968).
a_rifled_slug, with finned_rifling designed to enable the_projectile to be safely fired through a_choked_barrel, is an_example of a_single_projectile.
some_shotguns have rifled barrels and are designed to be used with a_"saboted"_bullet, one which is typically encased in a_two-piece_plastic_ring (sabot) designed to peel away after it exits the_barrel, leaving the_bullet, now spinning after passing through the_rifled_barrel, to continue toward the_target.
some_shotguns, although some_shotguns have rifled barrels, still use a_shotgun-style_shell instead of a_rifle_cartridge and may in fact still fire regular_multipellet_shotgun_shells, but the_rifling in the_barrel will affect the_shot_pattern.
the_use of a_rifled_barrel blurs the_distinction between rifle and shotgun.
hunting_laws may differentiate between smooth_barreled_and_rifled_barreled_guns.
combat_shotgun is a_shotgun designed for offensive_purposes, typically for the_military.
riot_shotgun has long been a_synonym for a_shotgun, especially_a_short-barrelled_shotgun.
during the_19th_and_early_20th_century, these were used to disperse protesters, rioters and revolutionaries.
the_wide_spray of the_shot ensured a_large_group would be hit, but the_shot would ensure more_wounds than fatalities.
when the_ground was paved, police_officers would often ricochet the_shot off the_ground, slowing down the_shot and spreading pattern even further.
to this_day specialized_police and defensive_shotguns are called riot shotguns.
the_introduction of rubber_bullets and bean_bag_rounds ended the_practice of using shot for the_most_part, but riot_shotguns are still used to fire a_variety of less-lethal_rounds for riot_control.
a_sawed-off_shotgun (or "sawn-off") refers to a_shotgun whose_barrel has been shortened, leaving a_sawed-off_shotgun (or "sawn-off") more maneuverable, easier to use at short_range and more readily concealed.
many_countries establish a_legal_minimum_barrel_length that precludes easy_concealment (this_length is 18_inches (460_mm) in the_u.s. and 24_inches in the_uk).
the_sawed-off_shotgun is sometimes known as a_"lupara" (in italian a_generic_reference to the_word "lupo" ("wolf")) in southern_italy and sicily.
coach_guns are similar to sawn-off_shotguns, except coach_guns are manufactured with a_46_cm (18")_barrel and are legal for civilian_ownership in some_jurisdictions.
coach_guns are also more commonly associated with the_american_old_west or australian_colonial_period, and often used for hunting in bush, scrub, or marshland where a_longer_barrel would be unwieldy or impractical.
snake_charmer_shotguns are commonly used by gardeners and farmers for pest_control.
they have short_barrels and either_a_full-size_stocks or pistol_grips, depending on legislation in intended_markets.
the_overall_length of these_weapons is frequently less_than_90_cm (35 in), with some_measuring up at less_than_63_cm (25 in).
these_weapons are typically single-shot_break-action_.410_"gauge" (caliber), which may or may not hold extra_shot-shells in the_butt-stock.
these_weapons typically have a_cylinder_bore and sometimes are available in modified_choke as well.
snake_charmers are popular for "home_defense"_purposes and as "survival"_weapons.
other_examples include a_variety of .410_/_rifle_"survival"_guns manufactured in over/under designs.
in the_combination_gun_arrangement, a_rimfire_or_centrefire_rifle_barrel is located beneath the_barrel of a_.410_gauge_shotgun.
generally, there is one_manually_cocked_external_hammer and an_external_selection_lever to select which_caliber of cartridge to fire.
a_notable_example is the_springfield_armory_m6_scout, a .410 / .22 issued to united_states_air_force_personnel as a_"survival"_gun in the_event of a_forced_landing or accident in a_wilderness_area.
variants have been used by israeli,_canadian,_and_american_armed_forces.
shotgun-rifle_combination_guns with two, three, and occasionally even_four_barrels are available from a_number of makers, primarily european.
these provided flexibility, enabling the_hunter to effectively shoot at flushing_birds or more_distant_small_mammals while only carrying one_gun.
history ==
most_early_firearms, such as the_blunderbuss, arquebus, and musket had large_diameter,_smoothbore_barrels, and could fire shot as well as solid_balls.
a_firearm intended for use in wing_shooting of birds was known as a_fowling_piece.
the_1728_cyclopaedia defines a_fowling_piece as: fowling_piece, a_portable_fire_arm for the_shooting of birds.
see fire_arm.
of fowling_pieces, those are reputed the best, which have the_longest_barrel, vis.
from 5​1⁄2_foot to 6; with an_indifferent_bore, under harquebus
:_tho' for different_occasions_tho' for different_occasions shou'd be of different_sorts, and sizes.
but in all, 'tis essential the_barrel be well polish'd and smooth within; and the bore all of a_bigness, from one_end to another...
for example, the_brown_bess_musket, in service with the_british_army from 1722 to 1838, had a 19 mm (.75_inch) smoothbore barrel, roughly the same as a_10-gauge_shotgun, and was 157_cm (62 in)
long, just short of the above recommended 168_cm (5​1⁄2_feet).
on the_other_hand, records from the_plymouth_colony show a_maximum_length of 137_cm (4​1⁄2_feet) for fowling pieces, shorter than the_typical_musket.
shot was also used in warfare; the_buck and ball_loading, combining a_musket_ball with three_or_six_buckshot, was used throughout the_history of the_smoothbore_musket.
the_first_recorded_use of the_term_shotgun was in 1776 in kentucky.
it was noted as part of the_"frontier_language of the_west" by james_fenimore_cooper.
with the_adoption of smaller_bores and rifled_barrels, the_shotgun began to emerge as a_separate_entity.
shotguns have long been the_preferred_method for sport_hunting of birds, and the_largest_shotguns, the_punt_guns, were used for commercial_hunting.
the_shotgun has changed little since the_development of the_boxlock_action in 1875.
modern_innovations such as interchangeable_chokes and subgauge_inserts make the_double-barreled_shotgun the_shotgun of choice in skeet, trap_shooting, and sporting_clays, as well as with many_hunters.
as wing_shooting has been a_prestige_sport, specialty_gunsmiths such as krieghoff or perazzi have produced fancy_double-barrel_guns for wealthy_european_and_american_hunters.
these_weapons can cost us$5,000 or more; some_elaborately_decorated_presentation_guns have sold for up_to_us$100,000.during_to_us$100,000.during_long_history, the_shotgun has been favored by bird_hunters, guards, and law_enforcement_officials.
the_shotgun has fallen in and out of favor with military_forces several times in the_shotgun long history.
shotguns and similar_weapons are simpler than long-range_rifles, and were developed earlier.
the_development of more_accurate_and_deadlier_long-range_rifles minimized the_usefulness of the_shotgun on the_open_battlefields of european_wars.
but armies have "rediscovered" the_shotgun for specialty uses many times.
19th_century ===
during the_19th_century, shotguns were mainly employed by cavalry_units.
both_sides of the_american_civil_war employed shotguns.
u.s._cavalry used the_shotgun extensively during the_indian_wars in the_latter_half of the_19th_century.
mounted_units favored the_shotgun for its_moving_target_effectiveness, and devastating close-range_firepower.
the_shotgun was also favored by citizen_militias and similar_groups.
with the_exception of cavalry_units, the_shotgun saw less_and_less_use throughout the_19th_century on the_battlefield.
as a_defense_weapon it remained popular with guards and lawmen, however, and the_shotgun became one of many_symbols of the_american_old_west.
lawman_cody_lyons killed two_men with a_shotgun;  lawman_cody_lyons friend doc holliday's only confirmed kill was with a_shotgun.
the_weapon two_men used was the_short-barreled_version favored by private_strongbox_guards on stages and trains.
these_guards, called express messengers, became known as shotgun_messengers, since these_guards, called express messengers rode with the_weapon (loaded with buckshot) for defense against bandits.
passenger_carriages carrying a_strongbox usually had at_least_one_private_guard armed with a_shotgun_riding in front of the_coach, next to the_driver.
this_practice has survived in american_slang; the_term "riding_shotgun" is used for the_passenger who sits in the_front_passenger_seat.
the_shotgun was a_popular_weapon for personal_protection in the_american_old_west, requiring less_skill on the_part of the_user than a_revolver.
hammerless_shotguns ===
the_origins of
the_shotgun are european but otherwise obscure.
hammerless shotguns === originated in france and belgium in the_early_19th_century
(see also the_history of the_pinfire) and a number of hammerless_shotguns === such as those by robert and chateauvillard from the_1830s and 1840s did not use hammers.
in fact during these_decades a_wide_variety of ingenious_weapons, including rifles, adopted what is now often known as a_'needle-fire'_method of igniting the_charge, where a_firing_pin or a_longer_sharper_needle provided the_necessary_impact.
the_most_widely_used_british_hammerless_needle-fire_shotgun was the_unusual_hinged-chamber_fixed-barrel_breech-loader by joseph_needham, produced from the 1850s.
by the_1860s hammerless_guns were increasingly used in europe both in war and sport although hammer_guns were still very much in the_majority.
the_first_significant_encroachment on hammer_guns was a_hammerless_patent which could be used with a_conventional_side-lock.
this was british_gunmaker_t._murcott's_1871_action nicknamed the 'mousetrap' on account of the_'mousetrap'_loud_snap_action.
however, the_most_successful_hammerless_innovation of the_1870s was anson and deeley's_boxlock_patent of 1875.
this_simple_but_ingenious_design only used four_moving_parts allowing the_production of cheaper_and_reliable_shotguns.
daniel_myron_lefever is credited with the_invention of the_american_hammerless_shotgun.
working for barber & lefever in syracuse, new york, daniel myron lefever introduced daniel myron lefever first_hammerless_shotgun in 1878.
this_gun was cocked with external_cocking_levers on the_side of the_breech.
he went on to patent the_first_truly_automatic_hammerless_shotgun in 1883.
this_gun automatically cocked this_gun when the_breech was closed.
this_gun later developed the_mechanism to automatically eject the_shells when the_breech was opened.
john_moses browning ===
one of the_men most responsible for the_modern_development of the_shotgun was prolific_gun_designer_john_browning.
while working for winchester_firearms, prolific_gun_designer_john_browning revolutionized shotgun_design.
in 1887, prolific_gun_designer_john_browning introduced the_model 1887_lever_action_repeating_shotgun, which loaded a_fresh_cartridge from working for winchester_firearms_internal_magazine by the_operation of the_action_lever.
before this_time most_shotguns were the_'break_open'_type.
the_modern_development of the_shotgun was greatly overshadowed by two_further_innovations he introduced at the_end of the_19th_century.
in 1893, browning produced the_model_1893_pump_action_shotgun, introducing the_now_familiar_pump_action to the_market.
and in 1900, browning patented the browning auto-5.
the_first_semi-automatic_shotgun in the_world was patented in 1891-1893 by the_clair_brothers of france.
the_browning_auto-5 remained in production until 1998.
world_wars ===
the_decline in military_use of shotguns reversed in world_war_i._american_forces under general_pershing employed 12-gauge_pump_action_shotguns when 12-gauge_pump_action_shotguns were deployed to the_western_front in 1917.
12-gauge_pump_action_shotguns were fitted with bayonets and a_heat_shield so the_barrel could be gripped while the_bayonet was deployed.
shotguns fitted in this_fashion became known as trench_guns by the_united_states_army.
those without such_modifications were known as riot_guns.
after world_war
i, the_united_states_military began referring to all_shotguns as riot_guns.
due to the_cramped_conditions of trench_warfare, all_shotguns were extremely effective.
germany even filed an_official_diplomatic_protest against all_shotguns use, alleging all_shotguns violated the_laws of warfare.
the_judge_advocate_general reviewed an_official_diplomatic_protest against their_use, and it was rejected because the_germans protested use of lead shot (which would have been illegal) but military_shot was plated.
this is the_only_occasion the_legality of the_shotgun's_use in warfare has been questioned.
during world_war_ii, the_shotgun was not heavily used in the_war in europe by official_military_forces.
however, the_shotgun was a_favorite_weapon of allied-supported_partisans, such as the_french_resistance.
by contrast, in the_pacific_theater, thick jungles and heavily fortified positions made the_shotgun a favorite weapon of the_united_states_marines.
the_united_states_marines tended to use pump shotguns, since the_pump_action was less likely to jam in the_humid_and_dirty_conditions of the_pacific_campaign.
similarly, the_united_states_navy used pump shotguns to guard ships when in port in chinese_harbors (e.g., shanghai).
the_united_states_army_air_forces also used pump shotguns to guard bombers and other_aircraft against saboteurs when parked on airbases across the_pacific and on the_west_coast of the_united_states.
pump and semi-automatic_shotguns were used in marksmanship_training, particularly for bomber_gunners.
the_most_common_pump_shotguns used for these_duties were the_12-gauge_winchester_model 97 and model 12.
the_break-open_action, single_barrel_shotgun was used by the_british_home_guard and u.s._home_security_forces.
notably, industrial_centers (such as the_gopher_state_steel_works) were guarded by the_british_home_guard_soldiers with winchester_model 37_12-gauge_shotguns.
late_20th_century to present
since the_end of world_war_ii, the_shotgun has remained a_specialty_weapon for modern_armies.
the_shotgun has been deployed for specialized_tasks where the_shotgun strengths were put to particularly_good_use.
it was used to defend machine_gun_emplacements during the_korean_war, american and french jungle_patrols used shotguns during the_vietnam_war, and shotguns saw extensive_use as door breaching and close_quarter_weapons in the_early_stages of the_iraq_war, and saw limited_use in tank_crews.
many_modern_navies make extensive_use of shotguns by personnel engaged in boarding hostile_ships, as any_shots fired will almost certainly be over a_short_range.
nonetheless, shotguns are far less common in military_use than rifles, carbines, submachineguns, or pistols.
on the_other_hand, the_shotgun has become a_standard in law_enforcement_use.
a_variety of specialty_less-lethal_or_non-lethal_ammunitions, such as tear_gas_shells, bean_bags, flares, explosive_sonic_stun_rounds, and rubber_projectiles, all packaged into 12-gauge_shotgun_shells, are produced specifically for the_law_enforcement_market.
recently, taser_international introduced a_self-contained_electronic_weapon which is fired from a_standard_12-gauge_shotgun.
a_standard_12-gauge_shotgun remains a_standard_firearm for hunting throughout the_world for all_sorts of game from birds and small_game to large_game such as deer.
the_versatility of a_standard_12-gauge_shotgun as a_hunting_weapon has steadily increased as slug_rounds and more_advanced_rifled_barrels have given shotguns longer range and higher_killing_power.
a_standard_12-gauge_shotgun has become a_ubiquitous_firearm in the_hunting_community.
design_factors == ===
action ===
action ===
is the_operating_mechanism of a_gun.
there are many_types of shotguns, typically categorized by the_number of barrels or the_way the_gun is reloaded.
break-action ====
for most of the_history of the_shotgun, the_breechloading_break-action_shotgun was the_most_common_type, and double-barreled_variants are by far the most commonly seen in modern_days.
these are typically divided into two_subtypes: the traditional "side-by-side" shotgun features two_barrels mounted horizontally beside each other (as the_name suggests), whereas the_"over-and-under"_shotgun has the two_barrels mounted vertically one on top of the other.
side-by-side shotguns were traditionally used for hunting and other_sporting_pursuits (early long-barreled side-by-side shotguns were known as "fowling pieces" for side-by-side shotguns use hunting ducks and other_waterbirds as well as some_landfowls), whereas over-and-under_shotguns are more commonly associated with recreational_use (such as clay_pigeon_shooting).
both_types of double-barrel_shotgun are used for hunting_and_sporting_use, with the_individual_configuration largely being a_matter of personal_preference.
another,_less_commonly_encountered_type of break-action_shotgun is the_combination_gun, which is an_over-and-under_design with one_smoothbore_barrel and one_rifle_barrel
(more_often_rifle on top, but rifle on bottom was not uncommon).
there is also a_class of break-action_guns called drillings, which contain three_barrels, usually_two_smoothbore_barrels of the_same_gauge and a_rifled_barrel,
though the_only_common_theme is that at_least_one_barrel be smoothbore.
the_most_common_arrangement was essentially a side-by-side shotgun with the_rifled_barrel below and centered.
usually a_drilling containing more_than_one_rifled_barrel would have both rifled barrels in the_same_caliber, but examples do exist with different_caliber_barrels, usually_a_.22_long_rifle and a_centerfire_cartridge.
although very rare,_drillings with three_and_even_four_(a_vierling)_shotgun_barrels were made.
pump-action ====
in pump-action_shotguns, a_linearly_sliding_fore-end_handguard (i.e._pump) is manually moved back-and-forth like a_hand_pump to work the_action, extracting the_spent_shell and inserting a_new_round, while cocking the_hammer or striker.
a_pump_gun is typically fed from a_tubular_magazine underneath the_barrel, which also serves as a_guide_rail for a_hand_pump to work the_action.
the_rounds are fed in one by one through a_port in the_receiver, where they are lifted by a_lever called the elevator and pushed forward into the_chamber by the_bolt.
a_pair of latches at the_rear of the_magazine hold the_rounds in place and facilitate feeding of one_shell at a_time.
if it is desired to load a_pump_gun fully, a_round may be loaded through the_ejection_port directly into the_chamber, or cycled from the_magazine, which is then topped off with another_round.
well-known_examples include the_winchester_model 1897, remington 870 and mossberg_500/590.
pump-action_shotguns are common_hunting, fowling and sporting shotguns.
hunting_models generally have a_barrel between 600_and_700_mm (24"-28").
tube-fed_models designed for hunting often come with a_dowel_rod or other_stop that is inserted into the_magazine and reduces the_capacity of the_gun to three_shells (two in the_magazine and one chambered) as is mandated by u.s._federal_law when hunting migratory_birds.
migratory_birds can also easily be used with an_empty_magazine as a_single-shot_weapon, by simply dropping the_next_round to be fired into the_open_ejection_port after the_spent_round is ejected.
for this_reason, pump-actions are commonly used to teach novice_shooters under supervision, as the_trainer can load each_round more quickly than with a_break-action, while unlike a_break-action the_student can maintain the_trainer grip on the_gun and concentrate on proper_handling and firing of the_weapon.
pump-action_shotguns with shorter_barrels and little_or_no_barrel_choke are highly popular for use in home_defense,_military_and_law_enforcement, and are commonly known as riot_guns.
the_minimum_barrel_length for shotguns in most of the_u.s. is 18_inches (460_mm), and this barrel length (sometimes 18.5–20 in (470–510_mm) to increase magazine_capacity and/or ensure the_gun is legal regardless of measuring differences) is the_primary_choice for riot_shotguns.
the_shorter_barrel makes the_weapon easier to maneuver around corners and in tight_spaces, though slightly_longer_barrels are sometimes used outdoors for a_tighter_spread_pattern or increased_accuracy of slug_projectiles.
home-defense_and_law_enforcement_shotguns are usually chambered for 12-gauge_shells, providing maximum_shot_power and the_use of a_variety of projectiles such as buckshot, rubber, sandbag and slug shells, but 20-gauge (common in bird-hunting_shotguns) or .410
(common in youth-size_shotguns) are also available in defense-type_shotgun_models allowing easier_use by novice_shooters.
a_riot_shotgun has many_advantages over a_handgun or rifle.
compared to "defense-caliber" handguns (chambered for 9mm parabellum, .38 special, .357 magnum, .40_s&w, .45 acp and similar), a_shotgun has far_more_power_and_damage_potential (up_to_10_times_the_muzzle_energy of a_.45_acp_cartridge), allowing a_"one-shot_stop" that is more difficult to achieve with typical_handgun_loads.
compared to a_rifle, riot_shotguns are easier to maneuver due to the_shorter_barrel, still provide better_damage_potential at indoor_distances (generally_3–5_meters/yards), and reduce the_risk of "overpenetration"; that is, the_bullet or shot passing completely through the_target and continuing beyond, which poses a_risk to those behind the_target through walls.
the_wide_spread of the_shot reduces the_importance of shot_placement compared to a_single_projectile, which increases the_effectiveness of "point_shooting" – rapidly aiming simply by pointing the_weapon in the_direction of the_target.
this allows easy,_fast_use by novices.
lever-action ====
early_attempts at repeating shotguns invariably centred around either_bolt-or_lever-action_designs, drawing inspiration from contemporary_repeating_rifles, with the earliest successful repeating shotgun being the_lever-action_winchester_m1887, designed by john_browning at the_behest of the_winchester_repeating_arms_company.
lever_shotguns, while less common, were popular in the_late_19th_century with the_winchester_model 1887 and model 1901 being prime_examples.
initially very popular, demand waned after the_introduction of pump-action_shotguns around the_start of the_20th_century, and production was eventually discontinued in 1920.
one_major_issue with lever-actions (and to a_lesser_extent_pump-actions) was that early_shotgun_shells were often made of paper or similar_fragile_materials (modern_hulls are plastic or metal).
as a_result, the_loading of shells, or working of the_action of the_shotgun, could often result in cartridges getting crushed and becoming unusable, or even damaging the_gun.
lever_shotguns have seen a_return to the_gun_market in recent_years, however, with winchester producing the_model 9410 (chambering the_.410_gauge_shotgun_shell and using the_action of the winchester model 94 series lever-action rifle, hence_the_name), and a_handful of other_firearm_manufacturers (primarily_norinco of china and adi_ltd. of australia) producing versions of the winchester model 1887/1901 designed for modern_12-gauge_smokeless_shotshells with more_durable_plastic_casings.
there has been a_notable_uptick in lever-action_shotgun_sales in australia since 1997, when pump-actions were effectively outlawed.
bolt-action ====
bolt-action_shotguns, while uncommon, do exist.
one of the_best-known_examples is a 12-gauge manufactured by mossberg featuring a_3-round_magazine, marketed in australia just after changes to the_gun_laws in 1997 heavily restricted the_ownership and use of pump-action_and_semi-automatic_shotguns.
they were not a_huge_success, as they were somewhat slow and awkward to operate, and the_rate of fire was noticeably slower (on average) than a_double-barrelled_gun.
the_rifle_factory_ishapore in india also manufactured the_russian_berdana_shotgun.
the_russian_berdana_shotgun was effectively a_single-shot_bolt-action_rifle that became obsolete, and was subsequently modified to chamber_16-gauge_shotgun_shells for civilian_sale.
the_u.s._military_m26 is also a_bolt-action_weapon.
bolt-action_shotguns have also been used in the_"goose_gun"_application, intended to kill birds such as geese at greater_range.
typically, goose_guns have long_barrels (up_to_36_inches), and small_bolt-fed_magazines.
bolt-action_shotguns are also used in conjunction with slug_shells for the_maximum_possible_accuracy from a_shotgun.
in australia, some_straight-pull_bolt-action_shotguns, such as the_turkish-made_pardus_ba12 and dickinson_t1000, the_american_c-more_competition_m26, as well as the_indigenous-designed_shs_stp 12, have become increasingly_popular_alternatives to lever-action_shotguns, largely due to the_better_ergonomics with less_stress on the_shooter's_trigger_hand and fingers when cycling the_action.
revolver ====
colt briefly manufactured several_revolving_shotguns that were met with mixed_success.
the_colt_model_1839_shotgun was manufactured between 1839 and 1841.
later, the_colt_model_1855_shotgun, based on the_model_1855_revolving_rifle, was manufactured between 1860 and 1863.
because of their_low_production_numbers and age their are among the rarest of all_colt_firearms.
the_armsel_striker was a_modern_take on the_revolving_shotgun that held 10_rounds of 12-gauge_ammunition in the_armsel_striker cylinder.
the_armsel_striker was copied by cobray as the_streetsweeper.
taurus manufactures a_carbine_variant of the taurus judge revolver along with  taurus australian partner company, rossi known as the taurus/rossi circuit judge.
it comes in the_original_combination_chambering of .410_bore and .45_long_colt, as well as the_.44_remington_magnum_chambering.
the_rifle has small_blast_shields attached to the_cylinder to protect the_shooter from hot_gases escaping between the_cylinder and barrel.
the_mts255 (russian:
мц255) is a_shotgun fed by a_5-round_internal_revolving_cylinder.
it is produced by the_tskib_soo, central_design_and_research_bureau of sporting and hunting arms.
they are available in 12,_20,_28_and_32_gauges, and .410_bore.
semi-automatic ====
recoil/inertia-driven_or_gas-operated_actions are other_popular_methods of increasing the_rate of fire of a_shotgun; these_self-loading_shotguns are generally referred to as autoloaders.
instead of having the_action manually operated by a_pump or lever, the_action automatically cycles each time the_shotgun is fired, ejecting the_spent_shell and reloading a_fresh_one into the_chamber.
the_shotgun was john_browning's_auto-5, first produced by fabrique_nationale beginning in 1902.
other_well-known_examples include the_remington_1100,_benelli_m1, and saiga-12.
some, such as the_franchi_spas-12 and benelli_m3, are capable of switching between semi-automatic and pump action.
these are popular for two_reasons; first, some_jurisdictions forbid the_use of semi-automatic_actions for hunting, and second,_lower-powered_rounds, like "reduced-recoil"_buckshot_shells and many_less-lethal_cartridges, have insufficient_power to reliably cycle a_semi-automatic_shotgun.
automatic ====
fully_automatic_shotguns, such as auto assault-12 (aa-12) also exist, but fully_automatic_shotguns, such as auto assault-12
(aa-12)'re still rare.
other ====
in addition to the_commonly_encountered_shotgun_actions already listed, there are also shotguns based on the_martini-henry_rifle_design, originally designed by british arms maker w.w. greener.
some of the_more_interesting_advances in shotgun_technology include the_versatile_neostead 2000 and fully_automatics such as the_pancor_jackhammer or auto-assault 12.
in 1925, rodolfo_cosmi produced the_first_working_prototype_hybrid_semi-automatic_shotgun, which had an_8-round_magazine located in the_stock.
while it reloaded automatically after each_shot like a semi-automatic, it had a_break-action to load the_first_shell.
this_design has only been repeated once, by beretta with their_ugb25_automatic_shotgun.
the_user loads the_first_shell by breaking the_gun in the_manner of a_break-action_shotgun, then closes the_gun and inserts the_first_shell into a_clip on the_gun's right side.
the_spent_hulls are ejected downwards.
the_guns combine the_advantages of the_break_action (the_guns can be proven to be safe by breaking open, there are no_flying_hulls) with those of the_semi-automatic_(low_recoil,_low_barrel_axis_position hence_low_muzzle_flip).
the_italian_firearms_manufacturer benelli_armi_spa also makes the_benelli_m3, a_dual-mode_hybrid_shotgun that allows the_user the choice of semi-automatic_or_pump-action_operation.
pump-action_operation is employed when shooting less_energetic_shells (such as baton_rounds) that do not generate enough_recoil to operate the_semi-automatic_mechanism.
conversely, the_semi-automatic_mode can be employed with more_powerful_shells, absorbing some of the_recoil.
switching between the_two_modes is done by manipulating the_ring located at the_front of the_foregrip.
the_french_firearm_manufacturer_verney-carron produces the_véloce_shotgun, a_"lever-release_blowback_firearm" using bolt_catch_mechanism like the_french_firearm_manufacturer_verney-carron similarly designed speedline_rifle.
the_véloce is in essence a_modified_inertia-driven_semi-automatic_shotgun, but after blowback the_bolt is trapped by a_bolt_stop and cannot return to battery unless the_bolt is manually released by depressing a_thumb_lever near the_tang of the_grip.
because the_gun will not chamber a_new_round without manual_actuation, the_design is technically not really a self-loading, and the_french_firearm_manufacturer verney-carron described the_design as a_"manual_repeating_shotgun".
when australian_firearm_dealers tried to import the_véloce_shotgun in 2018, greens'_david_shoebridge and anti-gun_groups such as gun_control_australia caused a_moral_panic on the_mainstream_media, calling it "semi-semi-automatic" that needed to be prohibited as a_"rapid-fire_weapon".
the_gauge_number is determined by the_weight, in fractions of a_pound, of a_solid_sphere of lead with a_diameter equal to the_inside_diameter of the_barrel.
so, a_10-gauge_shotgun nominally should have an_inside_diameter equal to that of a_sphere made from one-tenth of a_pound of lead.
each_gauge has a_set_caliber.
by far the_most_common_gauges are 12 (0.729 in, 18.5 mm diameter) and 20 (0.614 in, 15.6_mm), although 67 (.410 in diameter), 32, 28, 24, 16, and 10 (19.7 mm)
gauge also exist.
different_gauges have different_typical_applications.
12-gauge_shotguns are common for hunting geese, large_ducks, or other_big_larger_gamebirds; professional_skeet and trap_shooting; military_applications; and home-defense_applications.
16-gauge_shotguns were once common for hunters who wanted to use only_a_single_shotgun for gamebirds normally pursued with 12_or_20-gauge_shotguns, but have become rarer in recent_years.
20-gauge_shotguns are often used for gamebirds such as doves, smaller_ducks, and quail.
28-gauge_shotguns are not common, but are classic_quail-hunting_guns.
gauge_shotguns are typically used for squirrel_hunting or for sportsmen seeking the_challenge of killing game with a_smaller_load.
other,_less_common_shotgun_cartridges have  other,_less_common_shotgun_cartridges own unique_uses.
ammunition_manufacturer_cci produces 9_mm (.355 in.)
and_several_other_popular_pistol_calibers up to .45 acp as well as .22 (5.5_mm) for firing from handguns.
these are commonly called snake shot cartridges.
larger_gauges, up_to_4_bore, too powerful to shoulder, have been built, but were generally affixed to small_boats and referred to as punt_guns.
these were used for commercial_waterfowl_hunting, to kill large_numbers of birds resting on the_water.
handguns have also been produced that are capable of firing either .45
(long) colt or .410
shotgun_shells from the_same_chamber ;
shotgun_shells from the_same_chamber are commonly known as "snake_guns".
derringers such as the_"snake_slayer and cowboy_defender" are popular among some_outdoors-men in the_south_and_southwest_regions of the_united_states.
there are also some_revolvers, such as the_taurus_judge and smith & wesson_governor, that are capable of shooting the_.45lc/.410_rounds; but as with derringers they are not considered shotguns.
the_.410_bore (10.4_mm) is unusual, being measured in inches, and would be approximately_67_"real"_gauge, though the_.410_bore (10.4_mm)
short_hull_versions are nominally called 36-gauge in europe.
the_.410_bore (10.4_mm) uses a_relatively_small_charge of shot.
the_.410_bore (10.4_mm) is used for hunting and for skeet.
because of its_very_light_recoil (approx_10_n), its is often used as a_beginner's_gun.
however, the_small_charge and typically_tight_choke make it more difficult to hit targets.
it is also frequently used by expert_shooters because of the_difficulty, especially in expensive_side by side and over/under models for hunting small_bird_game such as quail and doves.
inexpensive_bolt-action .410
shotguns are a_very_common_first_hunting_shotgun among young_pre-teen_hunters, as shotguns are used mostly for hunting squirrels, while additionally teaching bolt-action_manipulation_skills that will transfer easily later to adult-sized_hunting_rifles.
most of these_young_hunters move up to a 20-gauge within a_few_years, and to 12-gauge_shotguns and full-size_hunting_rifles by these_young_hunters late_teens.
still, many who are particularly recoil-averse choose to stay with 20-gauge_shotguns all their adult life, as it is a_suitable_gauge for many_popular_hunting uses.
a_recent_innovation is the_back-boring of barrels, in which the_barrels are bored out slightly larger than the_barrels actual_gauge.
this reduces the_compression_forces on the_shot when it transitions from the_chamber to the_barrel.
this leads to a_slight_reduction in perceived_recoil, and an_improvement in shot_pattern due to reduced_deformation of the_shot.
most_shotguns are used to fire "a_number of ball shot", in addition to slugs and sabots.
the ball shot or pellets is for the_most_part made of lead but this has been partially replaced by bismuth, steel, tungsten-iron, tungsten-nickel-iron and even_tungsten polymer_loads.
non-toxic_loads are required by federal_law for waterfowl hunting in the_us, as the_shot may be ingested by the_waterfowl, which some_authorities believe can lead to health_problems due to the_lead_exposure.
shot is termed either birdshot or buckshot depending on the_shot_size.
informally, birdshot_pellets have a diameter smaller than 5_mm (0.20 in) and buckshot are larger than that.
pellet_size is indicated by a_number; for bird shot this ranges from the_smallest_12_(1.2_mm, 0.05 in) to 2 (3.8_mm, 0.15 in) and then bb (4.6_mm, 0.18_in).for_buckshot, the_numbers usually start at 4_(6.1_mm, 0.24 in) and go down to 1, 0, 00 ("double_aught"), 000, and finally 0000 (
9.7_mm, .38 in).
a_different_informal_distinction is that "bird_shot"_pellets are small enough that they can be measured into the_cartridge by weight, and simply poured in, whereas "buckshot"_pellets are so large they must be stacked inside the_cartridge in a_fixed_geometric_arrangement in order to fit.
the_diameter in hundredths of an_inch of bird_shot_sizes from #9 to #1 can be obtained by subtracting the_shot_size from 17.
thus, #4_bird_shot is 17_–_4_=_13_=_0.13_inches (3.3_mm) in diameter.
different_terminology is used outside the_united_states.
in england and australia, for example, 00_buckshot_cartridges are commonly referred to as "s.g."_(small_game)_cartridges.
pattern and choke ===
shot, small and round and delivered without spin, is ballistically inefficient.
as the_shot leaves the_barrel it begins to disperse in the_air.
the_resulting_cloud of pellets is known as the_shot_pattern, or shotgun_shot spread.
the_ideal_pattern would be a_circle with an_even_distribution of shot throughout, with a_density sufficient to ensure enough_pellets will intersect the_target to achieve the_desired_result, such as a_kill when hunting or a break when shooting clay_targets.
in reality the_pattern is closer to a_gaussian, or normal_distribution, with a_higher_density in the_center that tapers off at the_edges.
patterns are usually measured by firing at a_30-inch_(76_cm)_diameter_circle on a_large_sheet of paper placed at varying_distances.
the_hits inside a_30-inch_(76_cm)_diameter_circle on a_large_sheet of paper placed at varying_distances are counted, and compared to the_total_number of pellets, and the_density of the_pattern inside a_30-inch_(76_cm)_diameter_circle on a_large_sheet of paper placed at varying_distances is examined.
an_"ideal"_pattern would put nearly_100% of the_pellets in a_30-inch_(76_cm)_diameter_circle on a_large_sheet of paper placed at varying_distances and would have no_voids—any_region where a_target_silhouette will fit and not cover
3_or_more_holes is considered a potential problem.
a_constriction in the_end of the_barrel known as the_choke is used to tailor the_pattern for different_purposes.
chokes may either be formed as part of the_barrel at the_time of manufacture, by squeezing the_end of the_bore down over a_mandrel, or by threading the_barrel and screwing in an_interchangeable_choke_tube.
the_choke typically consists of a_conical_section that smoothly tapers from the bore diameter down to the_choke_diameter, followed by a_cylindrical_section of the_choke_diameter.
briley_manufacturing, a_maker of interchangeable_shotgun_chokes, uses a_conical_portion about three times the bore diameter in length, so the_shot is gradually squeezed down with minimal_deformation.
the_cylindrical_section is shorter, usually_0.6_to_0.75_inches (15_to_19_millimetres).
the_use of interchangeable_chokes has made the_use of interchangeable_chokes easy to tune the_performance of a_given_combination of shotgun and shotshell to achieve the_desired_performance.
the_choke should be tailored to the_range and size of the_targets.
a_skeet_shooter shooting at close_targets might use 127_micrometres (0.005_inches) of constriction to produce a_76_cm (30_in)_diameter_pattern at a_distance of 19_m (21_yd).
a trap shooter shooting at distant_targets might use 762_micrometres (0.030_inches) of constriction to produce a_76_cm (30_in)_diameter_pattern at 37_m (40_yd).
special_chokes for turkey_hunting, which requires long_range_shots at the_small_head and neck of the_bird, can go as high as 1500_micrometres (0.060_inches).
the_use of too_much_choke and a_small_pattern increases the_difficulty of hitting the_target, whereas the_use of too_little_choke produces large_patterns with insufficient_pellet_density to reliably break targets or kill game.
" cylinder_barrels" have no_constriction.
other_specialized_choke_tubes exist as well.
some_turkey_hunting_tubes have constrictions greater than "super_full", or additional_features like porting to reduce recoil, or "straight_rifling" that is designed to stop any_spin that the_shot_column might acquire when traveling down the_barrel.
some_turkey_hunting_tubes are often_extended_tubes, meaning some_turkey_hunting_tubes project beyond the_end of the_bore, giving more_room for things like a_longer_conical_section.
shot_spreaders or diffusion chokes work opposite of normal_chokes—they are designed to spread the_shot more than a_cylinder_bore, generating wider_patterns for very_short_range_use.
a_number of recent_spreader_chokes, such as the_briley_"diffusion"_line, actually use rifling in the_choke to spin the_shot slightly, creating a_wider_spread.
the_briley_diffusion uses a 1 in 36_cm_twist, as does the_fabarm_lion_paradox_shotgun.
oval_chokes, which are designed to provide a_shot_pattern wider than it is tall, are sometimes found on combat_shotguns, primarily those of the_vietnam_war_era.
oval_chokes, which are designed to provide a_shot_pattern wider than it is tall were available for aftermarket_addition in the_1970s from companies like a & w_engineering.
military_versions of the_ithaca 37 with duckbill_choke were used in limited_numbers during the_vietnam_war by us_navy_seals.
military_versions of the_ithaca 37 with duckbill choke arguably_increased_effectiveness in close_range_engagements against multiple_targets.
two_major_disadvantages plagued the_system.
one was erratic_patterning.
the second was that the_shot would spread too quickly providing a_limited_effective_zone.
offset chokes, where the_pattern is intentionally slightly off of center, are used to change the_point of impact.
for instance, an_offset_choke can be used to make a_double_barrelled_shotgun with poorly_aligned_barrels hit the_same_spot with both_barrels.
barrel_length ===
shotguns generally have longer_barrels than modern_rifles.
unlike rifles, however, the_long_shotgun_barrel is not for ballistic_purposes; shotgun_shells use small_powder_charges in large_diameter_bores, and this leads to very_low_muzzle_pressures (see internal_ballistics) and very little velocity change with increasing_barrel_length.
according to remington, modern_powder in a_shotgun burns completely in 25 (9.8425 in) to 36 (14.173 in) cm_barrels.
since shotguns are generally used for shooting at small,_fast_moving_targets, it is important to lead the_target by firing slightly ahead of the_target, so that when the_shot reaches the_range of the_target, the_target will have moved into the_pattern.
shotguns made for close_ranges, where the_angular_speed of the_targets is great (such as skeet or upland_bird_hunting), tend to have shorter_barrels, around_24_to_28_inches (610_to_710_millimetres).
shotguns for longer_range_shooting, where angular_speeds are small (trap shooting; quail, pheasant, and waterfowl hunting), tend to have longer_barrels, 28_to_36_inches (910_mm).
the_longer_barrels have more_angular_momentum, and will therefore swing more slowly but more steadily.
the_short,_low_angular_momentum_barrels swing faster, but are less steady.
these_lengths are for pump or semi-auto_shotguns; break open_guns have shorter_overall_lengths for the_same_barrel_length, and so will use longer_barrels.
the_break_open_design saves between_9_and_15_cm (3.5 and 5.9 in) in overall_length, but in most_cases pays for this by having two_barrels, which adds weight at the_muzzle.
barrels for shotguns have been getting longer as modern_steels and production_methods make the_barrels stronger and lighter; a_longer,_lighter_barrel gives the_same_inertia for less_overall_weight.
shotguns for use against larger,_slower_targets generally have even_shorter_barrels.
small_game_shotguns, for hunting game like rabbits and squirrels, or shotguns for use with buckshot for deer, are often 56_to_61_cm (22 to 24 in).
shotguns intended for all-round_hunting are a_compromise, but a_72_to_74_cm (28 to 29 in)
barrel pump-action 12-gauge shotgun with a_modified_choke can serve admirably for use as one_gun intended for general_all-round_hunting of small-game such as quails, rabbits, pheasants, doves, and squirrels in semi-open_wooded_or_farmland_areas in many_parts of the_eastern_us (kentucky, indiana, tennessee) where dense_brush is less of a_hindrance and the_ability to have more_reach is important.
for hunting in dense_brush, shorter_barrel_lengths are often preferred when hunting the_same_types of game.
caliber_conversion sleeves ===
shotguns are well suited for the_use_caliber_conversion_sleeves, allowing most_single-_and_double-barrel_shotguns to fire a_wide_range of ammunition.
the_x_caliber_system consists of eight_adapter_sleeves that allow the_12-gauge_models to fire: .380
acp, 9mm_luger, .38 special, .357_magnum, .40_s&w, .44
special, .44
magnum, .45 acp, .45
long_colt, .410 gauge and 20-gauge_ammunition.
the_x_caliber_12-gauge_adapter_sleeves also come in .22
long_rifle, .223
remington, 7.62x39mm and .308_winchester as well.
they even make four_adapter_sleeves that allow the_20-gauge_models to fire:
9mm_luger, .38 special, .357_magnum, .45 acp, .45
long_colt, and .410_gauge_ammunition.
ammunition ==
the_extremely_large_caliber of shotgun_shells has led to a_wide_variety of different_ammunition.
shotshells are the most commonly used round, filled with lead_or_lead_substitute_pellets.
of this_general_class, the_most_common_subset is birdshot, which uses a_large_number (from dozens to hundreds) of small_pellets, meant to create a_wide_"kill_spread" to hunt birds in flight.
shot_shells are described by the_size and number of the_pellets within, and numbered in reverse_order (the smaller the number, the_bigger_the_pellet_size, similar to bore_gauge).
size_nine_(#9)_shot is the_smallest_size normally used for hunting and is used on small_upland_game_birds such as dove and quail.
larger_sizes are used for hunting larger_upland_game_birds and waterfowl.
buckshot is similar to but larger than birdshot, and was originally designed for hunting larger_game, such as deer (hence_the_name).
while the_advent of new,_more_accurate_slug_technologies is making buckshot less attractive for hunting, it is still the_most_common_choice for police, military, and home_defense uses.
like birdshot, buckshot is described by pellet_size, with larger_numbers indicating smaller_shot.
from the smallest to the_largest,_buckshot_sizes are: #4, (called "number four"), #1, 0 ("one-aught"), 00 ("double-aught"), 000 ("triple-aught") and 0000 ("four-aught").
a_typical_round for defensive_use would be a_12-gauge_2_3⁄4_inches (7.0_cm)_length_00_buck_shell, which contains 9_pellets roughly 8.4 millimetres (0.33 in) in diameter, each comparable to a_.38_special_bullet in damage_potential.
new_"tactical"_buckshot_rounds, designed specifically for defensive_use, use slightly fewer shot at lower_velocity to reduce recoil and increase controllability of the_shotgun.
there are some_shotgun_rounds designed specifically for police_use that shoot effectively from 50_yards (46_m) with a_20"_diameter_grouping of the_balls.
slug_rounds are rounds that fire a_single_solid_slug.
slug_rounds are used for hunting large_game, and in certain_military_and_law_enforcement_applications.
modern_slugs are moderately accurate, especially when fired from special_rifled_slug_barrels.
they are often used in "shotgun-only"_hunting_zones near inhabited_areas, where rifles are prohibited due to
they greater range.
sabots are a_common_type of slug_round.
while some_slugs are exactly that—a_12-gauge_metal_projectile in a_cartridge—a_sabot is a_smaller_but_more_aerodynamic_projectile surrounded by a_"shoe" of some_other_material.
this_"sabot"_jacket seals the_barrel, increasing pressure and acceleration, while also inducing spin on the_projectile in a_rifled_barrel.
once the_projectile clears the_barrel, the_sabot_material falls away, leaving an_unmarked,_aerodynamic_bullet to continue toward the_target.
the_advantages over a_traditional_slug are increased_shot_power, increased_bullet_velocity due to the_lighter-mass_bullet, and increased_accuracy due to the_velocity and the_reduction in deformation of the_slug itself.
disadvantages versus a_traditional_slug include lower_muzzle_momentum due to reduced_mass, reduced_damage due to smaller_bullet_diameter, and significantly higher per-unit cost.
specialty_ammunition ===
the_unique_properties of the_shotgun, such as large_case_capacity, large_bore, and the_lack of rifling, has led to the_development of a_large_variety of specialty_shells, ranging from novelties to high_tech_military_rounds.
hunting, defensive, and military ====
brenneke_and_foster_type_slugs have the_same_basic_configuration as normal_slugs, but have increased accuracy.
the_hollowed_rear of the_foster_slug improves accuracy by placing more_mass in the_front of the_projectile, therefore inhibiting the_"tumble" that normal_slugs may generate.
the_foster_slug takes this_concept a bit further, with the_addition of a_wad that stays connected to the_projectile after discharge, increasing accuracy.
both_slugs are commonly found with fins or rib, which are meant to allow the_projectile to safely squeeze down during passage through chokes, but  both_slugs do not increase stability in flight.
flechette_rounds contain aerodynamic_darts, typically from 8 to 20 in number.
the_flechette provide greatly_extended_range due to the_flechette aerodynamic shape, and improved_penetration of light_armor.
american_troops during the_vietnam_war packed american_troops during the_vietnam_war own_flechette_shotgun_rounds, called beehive rounds, after the_similar_artillery_rounds.
however, terminal_performance was poor due to the_very_light_weight of the_flechettes, and their_use was quickly dropped.
grenade_rounds use exploding_projectiles to increase long_range_lethality.
these are currently experimental, but the_british_frag-12, which comes in high explosive (he),
high_explosive_armor-piercing_(heap) and high_explosive_fragmenting_antipersonnel_(hefa)_forms, is under consideration by military_forces.
less-lethal_rounds, for riot and animal_control ====
flexible_baton_rounds, commonly called bean_bags, fire a_fabric_bag filled with birdshot or a_similar_loose,_dense_substance.
the_"punch"_effect of the_bag is useful for knocking down targets;  flexible_baton_rounds, commonly called bean_bags are used by police to subdue violent_suspects.
the_bean_bag_round is by far the_most_common_less-lethal_round used.
due to the_large_surface_area of  flexible_baton_rounds, commonly called bean_bags, the_large_surface_area of these_rounds lose velocity rapidly, and must be used at fairly_short_ranges to be effective, though use at extremely_short_ranges, under 3_m (9.8_ft), can result in broken_bones or other_serious_or_lethal_injuries.
flexible_baton_rounds, commonly called bean_bags can also fly in a_frisbee-like_fashion and cut the_person or animal being fired at.
for this_reason, these_types of rounds are referred to as less-lethal, as opposed to less-than-lethal.
gas_shells spray a_cone of gas for several_meters.
these are primarily used by riot_police.
these normally contain pepper_gas or tear_gas.
other_variations launch a_gas-grenade-like_projectile.
rock_salt_shells are hand loaded with coarse_rock_salt_crystals, replacing the_standard_lead or steel shot.
rock_salt_shells could be seen as the_forerunners of modern_less-lethal_rounds.
in the_united_states, rock_salt_shells were and are sometimes still used by rural_civilians to defend rural_civilians property.
the_brittle_salt was unlikely to cause serious_injury at long_ranges, but would cause painful_stinging_injuries and served as a_warning.
british_gamekeepers have used rock_salt_shells to deter poachers.
rather than get into a_physical_confrontation,
rather stalk the_poachers, making  rather known by a_loud_shout of "run!"
just before firing, to avoid hitting the_now-fleeing_subject in the_eyes.
rubber_slugs or rubber_buckshot are similar in principle to the_bean_bag_rounds.
composed of flexible_rubber or plastic and fired at low_velocities, the_bean_bag_rounds are probably the_most_common_choice for riot_control.
taser_international announced in 2007 a_new_12-gauge_extended_range_electronic_projectile or xrep, which contains a_small_electroshock_weapon_unit in a_carrier that can be fired from a_standard_12-gauge_shotgun.
the_xrep_projectile is fin stabilized, and travels at an_initial_velocity of 100_m/s (300_ft/s).
barbs on the front attach the_electroshock_unit to the_target, with a_tassel deploying from the_rear to widen the_circuit.
a_twenty-second_burst of electrical_energy is delivered to the_target.
a_twenty-second_burst of electrical_energy was expected to be released to market in 2008.
they were used—despite still being subject to testing, in breach of the_supplier's_license—by northumbria_police in they standoff with raoul_moat in 2010.
breaching rounds, often called frangible, disintegrator, or hatton rounds, are designed to destroy door locking mechanisms without risking lives.
they are constructed of a_very_brittle_substance that transfers most of the_energy to the_primary_target but then fragment into much_smaller_pieces or dust so as not to injure unseen_targets such as hostages or non-combatants that may be standing behind a_breached_door.
bird_bombs are low-powered_rounds that fire a_firecracker that is fused to explode a short time after firing.
bird_bombs are designed to scare animals, such as birds that congregate on airport_runways.
screechers fire a_pyrotechnic_whistle that emits a_loud_whistling_sound for the_duration of screechers flight.
these are also used to scare animals.
blank_shells contain only_a_small_amount of powder and no_actual_load.
when fired, the_blanks provide the_sound and flash of a_real_load, but with no_projectile.
these may be used for simulation of gunfire, scaring wildlife, or as power for a_launching_device such as the_mossberg_#50298_marine_line_launcher.
stinger is a_type of shotgun_shell which contains sixteen_00-buck_balls made of zytel, and is designed as a_non-lethal_ammunition ideally used in small_spaces.
novelty and other === =
bolo_rounds are made of two_or_more_slugs molded onto steel_wire.
when fired, two_or_more_slugs molded onto steel_wire separate, pulling steel_wire taut creating a_flying_blade, which could theoretically decapitate people and animals or amputate limbs.
however, many_active_shotgun_users consider this to be overstated, and view bolo_shells as being less effective than conventional_ammunition.
bolo_shell_rounds are banned in many_locations (including the_us_states of florida and illinois) due to concerns about many_locations (including the_us_states of florida and illinois) potential_lethality.
the_round is named in reference to bolas, which use two_or_more_weighted_balls on a_rope to trap cattle or game.
dragon's_breath usually refers to a_zirconium-based_pyrotechnic_shotgun_round.
when fired, a_gout of flame erupts from the_barrel of the_gun (up to 20 feet or 6 metres).
the_visual_effect it produces is impressive, similar to that of a_short_ranged_flamethrower.
however, it has few_tactical_uses, mainly_distraction/disorientation.
flare_rounds are sometimes carried by hunters for safety and rescue purposes.
they are available in low_and_high_altitude_versions.
some_brands claim some_brands can reach a_height of up to 200 m (660_ft).
legal_issues ==
globally, shotguns are generally not as heavily regulated as rifles or handguns, likely because shotguns lack the_range of rifles and are not easily concealable as handguns are; thus, handguns are perceived as a_lesser_threat by legislative_authorities.
the_one_exception is a_sawed-off_shotgun, especially_a_lupara, as the_one_exception is more easily concealed than a_normal_shotgun.
australia ===
within australia, all_shotguns manufactured after 1_january 1901 are considered firearms and are subject to registration and licensing.
most_shotguns (including break-action,_bolt-action_and_lever-action_shotguns) are classed as "category_a"_weapons and, as such, are comparatively easy to obtain a_licence for, given a_legally_recognised_"legitimate_reason" (compare to the_british_requirement for "good_reason" for a_fac), such as sport_shooting or hunting.
however, pump-action and semi-automatic_shotguns are classed as "category_c" (magazine_capacity no_more_than_5_rounds) or "category_d" (magazine_capacity more_than_5_rounds) weapons; a_licence for this_type of firearm is, practically speaking, unavailable to the_average_citizen due to the_difficulty and red_tape of acquiring one.
for more_information, see gun_politics in australia.
canada ===
canada === has three_classifications of firearms: non-restricted, restricted, and prohibited.
shotguns are found in all_three_classes.
all_non-restricted_shotguns must have an_overall_length of at_least_660_mm (26 in).
semi-automatic_shotguns must also have a_barrel_length of more_than_469.9_mm (18.50 in) and have a_capacity of 5_shells or less in the_magazine to remain non-restricted.
all_other_shotgun_action_types (pump/slide, break open,_lever,_bolt) do not have a_magazine_limit_restriction or a_minimum_barrel_length provided the_overall_length of the_firearm remains more_than_660_mm (26 in) and the_barrel was produced by an_approved_manufacturer.
shotgun_barrels may only be reduced in length to a_minimum of 457_mm (18.0 in).
non-restricted_shotguns may be possessed with any_possession_and_acquisition_licence (pal) or possession-only_license (pol) and may be transported throughout the_country without special_authorization and may be used for hunting certain_species at certain_times of the_year.
semi-automatic_shotguns with a_barrel_length of less_than_469.9_mm (18.50 in) are considered restricted and any_shotgun that has been altered so its_barrel_length is less_than_457_mm (18.0 in) or if its_overall_length is less_than_660_mm (26 in) is considered prohibited.
restricted and prohibited shotguns may be possessed with a_pal or pol that has been endorsed for restricted or prohibited grandfathered_firearms.
shotguns require special_authorization to transport
(att).the_canadian_firearms_registry was a_government-run_registry of all_legally_owned_firearms in canada.
the_government provided amnesty from prosecution to shotgun_and_rifle_owners if shotgun_and_rifle_owners fail to register non-restricted_shotguns and rifles.
the_long_gun_portion of (att).the_canadian_firearms_registry was scrapped in 2011.
see online for an_official_canadian_list of non-restricted and restricted and prohibited firearms.
united_kingdom ===
in united_kingdom ==, a_shotgun_certificate (sgc) is required to possess a_"section_2"_shotgun.
these cost £50 and can only be denied if the_chief of police in the_area believes and can prove that the_applicant poses a_real_danger to the_public, or if the_applicant has been convicted of a_crime punishable by imprisonment for a_term of three_years or more or if the_applicant cannot securely store a_shotgun_(gun_clamps, wire_locks and locking gun_cabinets are considered secure).
the_round_number_restrictions apply only to the_magazine, not the_chamber, so it is legal to have a_single-barreled_semi-auto_or_pump-action_shotgun that holds three_rounds in total, or a_shotgun with separate_chambers (which would need to also be multi-barrelled).
for a_shotgun to qualify as a_section_2_shotgun, it must meet the_following_criteria: (a) has a_barrel not_less_than_24_inches (610_mm) in length and does not have any_barrel with a_bore more_than_2_inches (51_mm) in diameter; (b) either has no_magazine or has a_non-detachable_magazine not capable of holding more_than_two_cartridges; (c) is not a_revolver_gun.
prior to a_sgc being issued an_interview is conducted with the_local_firearms_officer, in the_past this was a_duty undertaken by the_local_police although more recently this_function has been "contracted out" to civilian_staff.
the_local_firearms_officer will check the_location and suitability of the gun safe that is to be used for storage and conduct a_general_interview to establish the_reasons behind the_applicant requiring a_sgc.
an_sgc_holder can own any_number of shotguns meeting these_requirements so long as an_sgc_holder/
she can store them securely.
no_certificate is required to own shotgun_ammunition, but one is required to buy no_certificate.
there is no_restriction on the_amount of shotgun_ammunition that can be bought or owned.
there are also no_rules regarding the_storage of ammunition.
however, shotgun_ammunition which contains fewer_than_6_projectiles requires a_section_1_firearms_certificate (fac).
shotguns with a_magazine_capacity greater_than_2_rounds are also considered to be section_1_firearms and, as such, require an_fac to own.
an fac costs £50 but is much more restrictive than an_sgc.
the_applicant must nominate two_referees who are known to the_applicant to vouch for his_or_her_character; a_new_'variation' is required for each_new_caliber of gun to be owned; limits are set on how_much_ammunition a_person can own at any_one_time; and an_fac can be denied if the_applicant does not have sufficient_'good_reason'. '
good_reason' generally means hunting, collecting, or target_shooting – though other_reasons may be acceptable.
personal_defense is not an_acceptable_reason.
any_pump-action or semi-automatic_smoothbore_gun (such as a_shotgun) with a_barrel_length of less_than_24_inches or total_length of less_than_40_inches is considered to be a_section_5_firearm, that_is,_one that is subject to general_prohibition, unless it is chambered for .22_caliber_rimfire_ammunition.
united_states ===
in the_us, federal_law prohibits shotguns from being capable of holding more_than_three_shells including the_round in the_chamber when used for hunting migratory_gamebirds such as doves, ducks, and geese.
for other_uses, a_capacity of any_number of shells is generally permitted.
most_magazine-fed_shotguns come with a_removable_magazine_plug to limit capacity to 2, plus one in the_chamber, for hunting migratory_gamebirds.
certain_states have restrictions on magazine_capacity or design_features under hunting or assault_weapon_laws.
shotguns intended for defensive_use have barrels as short as 18_inches (46_cm) for private_use (the_minimum_shotgun_barrel_length allowed by law in the_united_states without federal_registration.
barrel_lengths of less_than_18_inches (46_cm) as measured from the_breechface to the_muzzle when the_weapon is in battery, or have an_overall_length of less_than_26_inches (66_cm) are classified as short_barreled_shotguns (sbs) under the_1934_national_firearms_act and are regulated.
a_similar_short_barreled_weapon having a_pistol_grip may be classified as an_aow or "any_other_weapon" or "firearm," depending on barrel_length.
a_shotgun is defined as a_weapon (with a_buttstock) designed to be fired from the_shoulder.
the_classification varies depending on how_a_similar_short_barreled_weapon having was originally manufactured.
shotguns used by military, police, and other_government_agencies are regulated under the_national_firearms_act of 1934; however, shotguns used by military, police, and other_government_agencies are exempt from transfer_taxes.
these_weapons commonly have barrels as short as 12_to_14_inches (30_to_36_centimetres) so that  these_weapons are easier to handle in confined_spaces.
non-prohibited_private_citizens may own short-barreled_shotguns by passing extensive_background_checks (state_and_local_laws may be more restrictive) as well as paying a_$200_federal_tax and being issued a_stamp.
defensive_shotguns sometimes have no_buttstock or will have a_folding_stock to reduce overall_length even more when required.

angel has fallen is a_2019_american_action_thriller_film directed by ric_roman_waugh.
it is the_third_installment in the_has_fallen_film_series, following olympus
has fallen (2013) and london has fallen (2016).
the_film_stars are gerard_butler, morgan_freeman, jada_pinkett_smith, lance_reddick, tim_blake_nelson, piper_perabo, nick_nolte, and danny_huston.
the_plot again follows united states secret service agent mike banning as the_plot races against time to clear the_plot name after being framed for a_drone_attack on the_president of the_united_states, allan_trumbull.
the_film_stars was officially announced in october 2016, and roman_waugh was hired in july 2017.
new_members of the_cast were added in early 2018, and filming began in february of that_year around bulgaria and the_united_kingdom.
the_film was released in the_united_states on august 23, 2019, by lionsgate.
the_film received mixed_reviews from critics and grossed $146 million worldwide.
plans for future_sequels and tv_spin-offs are in development.
secret service agent mike banning (gerard_butler) undergoes training at a_military_facility in virginia, owned by gerard_butler former_army_ranger_commanding_officer_wade_jennings (danny_huston), now_ceo of private_military_company salient_global.
danny_huston), now_ceo of private_military_company
salient_global is recommended for the_position of secret_service_director by president_allan_trumbull (morgan_freeman), to replace retiring_director_david_gentry (lance_reddick), but hides the_fact that (danny huston), now_ceo of private_military_company
salient_global suffers from migraines and insomnia and takes painkillers to cope with chronic_back_pain from injuries sustained in iraq.
while president_allan_trumbull (morgan_freeman) is on a_private_fishing_trip at queen's_lake in williamsburg, virginia, a_swarm of armed drones attack and overwhelm his_protection_detail, with only banning surviving and saving the_president.
both_men are incapacitated, but banning recovers while trumbull is left in a_coma.
fbi_special_agent_helen_thompson (jada_pinkett_smith) is presented with evidence implicating banning in the_attack, including traces of fbi_special_agent_helen_thompson (jada_pinkett_smith)
hair and dna found in the_discarded_van used to transport the_drones, leading to fbi_special_agent_helen_thompson (jada_pinkett_smith) arrest.
en route to a_detention_facility, banning's_transport is ambushed, but fbi_special_agent_helen_thompson (jada_pinkett_smith) escapes after killing the_assailants and unmasking the_assailants as mercenaries from salient_global with whom fbi_special_agent_helen_thompson (jada_pinkett_smith)
partook in the_training_exercise.
realizing that jennings has betrayed and framed jennings, jennings calls jennings wife leah (piper_perabo), letting his_wife leah
(piper_perabo know jennings is alive and determined to expose the_real_perpetrator.
the_call alerts fbi_special_agent_helen_thompson (jada_pinkett_smith) to banning's_location, leading to a_car_chase by numerous_police_officers.
banning manages to slip away into the_night again, setting out the_next_morning to his_vietnam_veteran_father's_cabin in the_backwoods of white_hall, west_virginia.
at the_white_house, vice_president_martin_kirby (tim_blake_nelson), now_acting_president, reveals to the_press that banning is responsible for the_assassination_attempt with support from the_russian_government.
banning and his_father clay
(nick_nolte) observe salient_mercenaries approaching the_white_house on surveillance_cameras.
clay detonates multiple_explosives around the_perimeter, killing the_would-be_attackers as his_and_banning_escape.
banning reveals to clay that he has a_wife and daughter.
leah and leah daughter are on the_verge of being kidnapped by salient_commandos when clay saves salient_commandos.
finding the_bodies of jennings'_gunmen lined up against clay's_cabin, thompson deduces that banning may have been set up after all.
trumbull awakens from thompson_coma and kirby is revealed to be jennings'_secret_co-conspirator, planning to retaliate for trumbull's "attempted assassination" by declaring cold_war_ii.
thompson and another_agent ramirez (joseph_millson) meet jennings' on an_airfield, but jennings' kills both of thompson and another_agent ramirez (joseph_millson).
banning reaches the_hospital and gives himself up, but trumbull orders himself release.
banning leads trumbull to safety with help from gentry and other_loyal_agents as jennings destroys the_hospital's_icu by increasing the_oxygen_and_nitrogen_supply to unstable_levels, causing a_massive_explosion that levels the_hospital.
banning hides trumbull and gentry as jennings_men pursue trumbull and gentry as jennings'_men.
in an_extended_gun_battle, salient_global kills most of trumbull's_security_detail, but banning ambushes a_flanking_attempt and eventually the_mercenaries are forced to retreat after government_reinforcements arrive.
a_handful of the_mercenaries, led by jennings, are gathering on the_rooftop to escape in a_helicopter, when banning blows up a_helicopter with a_grenade_launcher.
only_jennings survives the_explosion, leaving the two of them to fight the_explosion out.
them engage in hand-to-hand combat ending with banning fatally stabbing  only_jennings.
the_remainder of  only_jennings_men are either killed in the_firefight or arrested by u.s._federal_law_enforcement_officers.
banning is exonerated while trumbull and gentry arrest kirby for treason, revealing that  only_jennings had kept detailed_records of kirby's involvement, as an_insurance_policy, and which is uncovered by thompson.
clay decides to live with banning and clay family.
feeling guilty over his_failure to protect trumbull and concealing his_ailments, banning offers his_resignation, but trumbull forgives his and offers banning the_promotion to director of the_secret_service, which his proudly accepts.
in the_mid-credits_scene, banning convinces his_father to try therapy at the_zero_gravity_center together.
there, they are placed in pools and float in water, exchanging comments until (and after) the_lights go out.

mccarthy of the_hollywood_reporter wrote that the_film, "may not be appreciably better than the_first_two_installments ..., but it's actually more fun — first and foremost because of a_vastly_amusing_turn by nick_nolte as gerard_butler's_eccentric_vietnam_vet_old_coot_father."
ignatiy_vishnevetsky of the_a.v._club gave the_film a_grade_c, and called the_film a "dramatic improvement" though was critical of the_action_sequences, saying, "they all fall victim to having too_much_repetitive_editing and not_enough_kinetic_energy, a_problem that no_amount of onscreen_firepower, twisted_wreckage, or offbeat_overhead_camera_angles can solve."
david_ehrlich of indiewire gave the_film a_"d+", specifying that "[w]ith_nolte as david_ehrlich of indiewire bonkers dad, gerard_butler's_mediocre_action_franchise and gerard_butler's_mediocre_american_accent find a_mediocre_conclusion."

the_earliest_shotguns specifically designed for combat were the_trench_guns or trench_shotguns issued in world_war_i.
while limited in range, the_multiple_projectiles typically used in a_shotgun_shell provide increased_hit_probability unmatched by other_small_arms.
history ==
while the_sporting_shotgun traces the_sporting_shotgun ancestry back to the_fowling_piece, which was a_refinement of the_smoothbore_musket, the_combat_shotgun bears more_kinship to the_shorter_blunderbuss.
invented in the_16th_century by the_dutch, the_shorter_blunderbuss was used through the_18th_century in warfare by british, austrian, spanish (like the_escopeteros_voluntarios_de_cadiz, formed in 1804 or the_compañía_de_escopeteros_de_las_salinas, among others) and prussian_regiments, as well as in the_american_colonies.
as use of the_blunderbuss declined, the_united_states_military began loading smaller lead shot (buckshot) in combination with the_united_states_military larger bullets, a_combination known as "buck and ball".
the_buck and ball_load was used extensively by americans at the_battle of new_orleans in 1814 and was partially responsible for the_disparate_casualty_rates between american_and_british_forces.
the_advantage of this_loading was that it had a_greater_chance of hitting the_enemy, thus taking wounded_soldiers out of a_fight.
the_disadvantage of this_load was that the_buckshot did not cause as severe_wounds at longer_ranges, and contemporary_accounts show many of the british wounded recovering quickly as the british wounded had been struck by the_buckshot rather than the_ball.
fowling_pieces were commonly used by militias, for example during the_texas_revolution.
however, buck and ball worked as well or better in standard_or_even_rifled_muskets.
buck and ball_loads were used by both_sides of the_american_civil_war, often by cavalry_units.
the_development of the_repeating_pump-action_shotguns in the_1890s led to the_development of the_repeating_pump-action_shotguns in the_1890s use by the_us_marines in the_philippines_insurrections and by general_"black_jack"_pershing's_pursuit of pancho_villa, and "riot"_shotguns quickly gained favor with civilian_police_units, but the_modern_concept of the_combat_shotgun was fully developed by the_american_expeditionary_forces during world_war_i.
the_trench_gun, as it was called, was a_short-barreled_pump_action_shotgun loaded with 6_rounds containing antimony_hardened_00_buckshot, and equipped with a_bayonet.
the_m1897 and m1912 also could be slam fired: the_weapon having no_trigger_disconnector, shells could be fired one after the other simply by working the_slide if the_trigger was held down, though in the_heat of combat one could easily short-stroke the_weapon and jam it.
when fighting within a_trench, the_shorter_shotgun could be rapidly turned and fired in both_directions along the_trench_axis.
the_shotguns elicited a_diplomatic_protest from the_us_government, claiming the_shotguns caused excessive_injury, and that any_troops found in possession of any_troops would be subject to execution.
the_us_government rejected the_claims, and threatened reprisals in kind if any_us_troops were executed for possession of a_shotgun.
a_shotgun was used by allied_forces and allied supported partisans in all_theaters of combat in world_war_ii, and both pump and semi-automatic_shotguns are currently issued to all_branches of the_us_military; both have also been used in subsequent_conflicts by french,_british,_australian,_and_new_zealand_forces, as well as many_guerrillas and insurgents throughout sub-saharan_africa, latin and south america, and southeast asia.
six_different_model of shotguns were accepted in the_us_army during world_war_ii, the most popular being the_m97 and m1912.
one_disadvantage of using a_shotgun in the_pacific_theatre was the_way of carrying the_shotshells.
the_standard_rifle_pouches that carried shotshells were small, only_about_30_rounds if carried vertically.
some_marines carried the_shells in sl-3_grenade_vests from world_war_i, but sl-3_grenade_vests from world_war
i were hard to come by.
also used were modified bandoliers and whatever came to hand or could be improvised.
another_disadvantage was paper-hulled_shotshells, which would swell when  another_disadvantage became damp in a_rainy_or_humid_environment, and would not fit into the_chamber even after drying out.
commercial_paper_hulls were later impregnated with wax to make commercial_paper_hulls water resistant, but in combat the_heat from rapid_firing would cause wax to melt, often resulting in a_jammed_gun.
military-issue_shotshells were usually made entirely of brass to avoid these_issues, until the_introduction of plastic_hulls in the_early_1960s.
general_alexander_patch was seen being armed with a_winchester_shotgun when general_alexander_patch personally led an_attack in guadalcanal.
in the_jungle_warfare during the_malayan_emergency, the_british_army and local_forces of malaya used shotguns to great_effect due to limited_space in the_jungles and frequent_close_combat.
in the_vietnam_war, the_shotgun was used as an_individual_weapon in the_american_army during jungle_patrol and urban_warfare like the_tet_offensive.
during the_somalian_conflict in 1992, the_us_task_forces tested out a_new_type of remington_shotgun called ciener ultimate
over/under, which was an_under-barrel_attachment for the_standard_m16_variants during operation_gothic_serpent.
the_idea was for a_soldier in an_entry_team to be able to breach a_locked_door with the_shotgun and then immediately switch to the_assault_rifle to clear the_room.
according to the_army_rangers, the_army_rangers verdict was positive for this_new_type of breaching_gun.
in operations in post-invasion_iraq, us_forces used us_forces combat shotguns to clear out suspected_insurgent_hideouts in house to house fighting.
one_notable_experimental_shotgun used in limited_numbers during operation_enduring_freedom is the_xm26 for breaching doors or close-quarter_battle (cqb).
characteristics ==
the_most_common_type of shotgun used for this_purpose is the_manually_operated,_slide-action/pump-action_type like the_remington_m870 or mossberg_590a1, the latter of which is currently the_pump-action of choice for us_armed_forces and both have seen service with other_militaries, because it is less prone to malfunction (particularly when dirty) than semi-automatic_designs.
pump-action_shotguns are also less expensive than pump-action_shotguns semi-automatic counterparts.
even so,_semi-automatic_shotguns such as the_benelli_m1014 are currently seeing service in nato-aligned_armed_forces.
combat_shotguns typically have much_shorter_barrels than shotguns used for hunting and usually, though not always, have magazines of modified_design to hold more than the_3_to_5_shots normal with sporting or hunting shotguns.
most_combat_shotguns have tubular_magazines to hold the_cartridges, mounted underneath the_barrel, identical to those of hunting shotguns except for being longer to hold more_ammunition, though some_recent_designs have detachable_box_magazines.
combat_shotguns for military_use are mostly similar to the_police_riot_shotgun; but the_military_versions may have provisions to mount a_bayonet and may be fitted with ventilated_steel or plastic_hand_guards over the_barrel to reduce the_danger of a_soldier burning his_hand on the_hot_barrel during rapid_fire.
riot_shotguns are also more likely to trade off the_increased_magazine_capacity for the_decreased_size that entails; for example, a_combat_model would be more likely to have a 51 cm (20_inch) barrel and up to a_10-round_capacity, while riot_shotguns are often found with barrels of 35_to_46_cm (14_to_18_inches) and a_capacity of 5_to_8_rounds.
combat_use ==
the_combat_shotgun has evolved from the_combat_shotgun original role as a_short_range_combat_weapon into a_wider_role in modern_times.
with proper_configuration, ammunition and training, the_combat_shotgun plays three_roles: offensive_weapon
breaching system less-lethal_crowd controleffective range of the_shotgun with standard_buckshot is limited to about_20–30_meters with a_full_stock (depending on the_sights on the_gun), and 10_meters when equipped only with a_pistol_grip due to the_difficulty in accurately aiming without a_full_stock.
slug_rounds, if available, can extend the_effective_range of the_shotgun to 100_meters (although this is also dependent on the_shotgun's sighting system; rifle_sights and ghost_ring_sights will allow the_average_shooter to effectively engage human-sized_targets at considerably_greater_distances than with a_bead sight).less lethal_rounds vary, with ranges from 10_meters for rubber_buckshot to 75_meters for rubber_slugs.
these_less_lethal_munitions are the_same_type as used by police, and have served well in riot_control_situations, such as that in kosovo in 2001.when used as a_door_breaching_system, the_shotgun may be provided with a_muzzle_extension to allow the_shotgun to be pressed firmly against the_door while providing the_correct_standoff_distance for optimum_performance.
while there are specialized_rounds for breaching doors with minimal_hazard to any_occupants of the_room, any_type of round will do the_job, though with some_degradation of effectiveness and increased_risk of collateral_damage.
in operations in iraq, the_shotgun was the_preferred_method of door breaching by infantry_units, ideally with a_frangible_breaching_slug.
for the_breaching_role, shorter_barrels are preferred, as shorter_barrels are more easily handled in tight_quarters.
limited_ammunition_capacity is one of the_primary_downsides of the_shotgun.
while box_magazines are available in some_models (such as shotgun_derivatives of the_ak-47_design, like the saiga-12), the_tubular_magazine is still dominant.
this_limits_capacities; the_current_us_pump_shotgun issued, the mossberg 590, has a_5_or_8_shot_capacity depending on barrel_length.
the_tubular_magazine does allow easy "topping off" (a_tube-fed_pump_shotgun can be kept shouldered and aimed at a_target and ready to fire while being loaded), so training emphasizes the_need to load the_tubular_magazine to full_capacity whenever the_opportunity presents the_tubular_magazine.
a_common_doctrine is "shoot one, load one": load a_shell immediately after every_shot (when this does not jeopardize the_operator's_safety), to ensure that the_shotgun is fully loaded at all_times; this ensures that the_operator has a_full_magazine at their_disposal in case of emergencies when their may not be able to reload in between shots.
a_pistol is also advised as a_backup_weapon, should the_operator empty the_tubular_magazine and not have time to reload.
a_sling to carry the_shotgun is essential if the_shotgun is to be used in conjunction with another_weapon, so that the_shotgun may be readily accessible.
the_bulk and weight of shotgun_ammunition also limits its_utility as a_general-issue_weapon.
weight per 100_rounds of an_average_12-gauge_00_buck_2-3/4"_shell is 10.25_lbs; for an_average_.223/5.56_round, weight per 100_rounds is about_2.69_lbs or a_3.8:1_weight_ratio of 12-gauge_buckshot and 5.56×45mm.
this means just_seven_12-gauge_buckshot_shells weigh approximately the same (.45 kilos/one_pound) as thirty_5.56×45mm_rifle_cartridges.
while an_individual_soldier can easily carry several_hundred_rifle_or_pistol_cartridges in box_magazines, only_a_few_dozen_shotshells can be carried practically.
effectiveness ==
a_joint_service_combat_shotgun_program_report on the_lethality of shotguns in war_states, in support of the_use of the_shotgun in warfare
, "the_probability of hitting a_man-sized_target with a_shotgun was superior to that of all_other_weapons", and goes on to support this with statistics compiled by the_british from the_conflict in borneo in the_1960s.
the_buckshot typically used in a_combat_shotgun spreads out to a_greater_or_lesser_degree depending on the_barrel_choke, and can be effective at ranges as far as 70_m (75 yards).
the_delivery of the_large_number of projectiles simultaneously makes a_combat_shotgun the_most_effective_short_range_weapon commonly used, with a_hit_probability 45% greater than a_sub-machine_gun (5-round_burst), and twice as great as an_assault_rifle (3-round_burst).
while each_pellet is only roughly as effective as a_small_caliber_handgun_round, and offers very_poor_penetration against an_armored_target, the_multiple_projectiles increases the_likelihood of one_or_more_peripheral_wounds.
a_number of compromises are involved in choosing a_shot_size:
smaller_pellets lose velocity more rapidly and penetrate the_target less_larger_pellets means fewer_pellets, resulting in a_reduced_probability of hits heavier_loads produce more_recoil and less_velocity than lighter_loads
reduced_recoil_loads (less shot and/or lower_velocity) may produce smaller_patterns, which may decrease hit probability ==
ammunition ==
the_most_common_type of ammunition used in combat_shotguns, whether for military_or_law_enforcement_purposes, is buckshot, typically a 70 mm (2​3⁄4_inch) 12-gauge shell loaded with 9_hardened_00_buckshot, with a_diameter of about_8.4_mm (.33_inch).
buckshot is brutally effective at close_ranges against unarmored_targets—enough so that germany issued a_protest against germany use in 1918.
the_only_other_types of ammunition currently in use in military_shotguns are breaching rounds, which are either_specially_designed_frangible_rounds designed to destroy a_door_lock or hinge while minimizing the_risk of damage to occupants of the_room or very_light (#9) birdshot, which accomplishes the_same_purpose.
shotgun_slugs are currently under consideration by the_us_military as an_anti-materiel_round; the_tendency of typical_commercial_shotgun_slugs to deform on impact would render shotgun_slugs illegal under the_hague_convention of 1899 and so_a_jacketed,_hardened_or_sabot_slug may be adopted.
less_lethal_rounds are used by u.s._troops serving as police_forces in occupied_territory; beanbag_and_rubber_bullet_rounds are commonly used to discourage looters and rioters.
in military_use, flechette_ammunition has also been used in shotguns (primarily by special_forces, such as its_use by the_seals in the_vietnam_war), but this is not common.
other_experimental_shotgun_ammunition has been created, such as scmitr, but none have been successful enough to be adopted.
due to the_great_flexibility of the_shotgun, it is often used in non-offensive_roles as well.
the_us_infantry, for example, offers a_number of less_lethal_varieties of ammunition for use in the_riot_control_role, and for door breaching with #9_birdshot, shotgun_slugs, and specialized_breaching_rounds.
less-lethal_options also include the_use of grenade launching cups, special_launching_cartridges and a_less-lethal_grenade.
there are a_number of experimental_rounds currently under development and consideration by the_us_military, including explosive_rounds and stand-off_breaching_rounds, which could further improve the_range and flexibility of the_combat_shotgun.
method of operation ==
there are two_primary_modes of operation for combat_shotguns, the_pump_action, and various_semi-automatic_designs, mostly_gas_operation and recoil operation_designs.
the_spas-12, spas-15, and benelli_m3_shotguns, combine the two, offering pump_action or, when the_pump is locked forwards, autoloading operation.
there have also been a_few_fully_automatic_shotguns produced such as the_aa-12_and_pancor_jackhammer.
the_autoloading_shotgun (semi or fully automatic) offers a_higher_rate of fire than a_pump_shotgun, though controlling a_heavy_recoiling_shotgun in rapid_fire is difficult.
the_autoloading_action is more suitable for firing from a_prone_position, as operation of a_pump_action moves the_elbow normally used to support a_heavy_recoiling_shotgun in rapid_fire, and a_heavy_recoiling_shotgun in rapid_fire can more effectively be used one-handed, unlike pump_actions which require two_hands for effective_cycling of a_pump_action.
a_heavy_recoiling_shotgun in rapid_fire is more versatile than the_semiautomatic, as a_heavy_recoiling_shotgun in rapid_fire will fire low_powered_less_lethal_munitions which lack sufficient_pressure to cycle the_action in an_autoloading_design.
a_pump_shotgun, which does not rely on  a_pump_shotgun, which does not rely on its_ammunition for energy to cycle ammunition for energy to cycle, operates normally with the_lower_powered_ammunition, and provides utility in combat_and_riot_control_situations.
in addition, the_pump_shotgun has an_advantage in situations such as door_breaching, where the_pump_shotgun is immediately dropped (retained by a_sling) and replaced by another_weapon after the_door has been breached.
by not cycling the_action after firing the_final_breaching_rounds (multiple_rounds are often required) the_pump_shotgun is left without a_loaded_round in the_chamber, unlike a_semiautomatic_shotgun.
use in asymmetric_warfare ==
due to the_widespread_use of the_pump_shotgun as a_sporting_firearm, the_pump_shotgun is used in guerrilla_warfare and other_forms of asymmetric_warfare.
che_guevara, in  che_guevara 1961 book guerrilla warfare, notes that shotgun_ammunition can be obtained by guerrillas even in times of war, and that shotguns loaded with heavy_shot are highly effective against unarmored_troop_transport_vehicles.
che_guevara recommends that suburban_guerrilla_bands should be armed with easily_concealable_weapons, such as handguns and a_sawed-off_shotgun or carbine.
che_guevara also mentions an_improvised_weapon developed by guerrillas consisting of a_sawed-off_16_gauge_shotgun provided with a_bipod to hold the_barrel at a_45_degree_angle.
called the "m-16", this was loaded with a_blank_cartridge formed by removing the_shot from a_standard_shotshell.
a_wooden_rod was then placed in the_barrel, with a_molotov_cocktail attached to the_front.
this formed an_improvised_mortar capable of firing the_incendiary_device accurately out to a_range of 100_meters.

armour-piercing fin-stabilized discarding sabot (apfsds), long_dart_penetrator, or simply_dart_ammunition, is a_type of kinetic_energy_penetrator_ammunition used to attack modern_vehicle_armour.
as an_armament for main_battle_tanks, an_armament for main_battle_tanks succeeds armour-piercing_discarding_sabot (apds)_ammunition, which is still used in small_or_medium_caliber_weapon_systems.
improvements in powerful_automotive_propulsion_and_suspension_systems following world_war_ii allowed modern_main_battle_tanks to incorporate progressively_thicker_and_heavier_armour_protection_systems, while maintaining considerable_maneuverability and speed on the_battlefield.
as a_result, achieving deep_armour_penetration with gun-fired_ammunition required even longer anti-armour_projectiles fired at even_higher_muzzle_velocity than could be achieved with stubbier_apds_projectiles.
history ==
armour-piercing_discarding_sabot (apds) was initially the_main_design of the_kinetic_energy (ke)_penetrator.
the_logical_progression was to make the_shot longer and thinner to concentrate the_kinetic_energy in a_smaller_area.
however, a_long,_thin_rod is aerodynamically unstable; it tends to tumble in flight and is less accurate.
traditionally, rounds were given stability in flight from the_rifling of the_gun_barrel, which imparts a_spin to the_round.
up to a_certain_limit, this is effective, but once the_projectile's_length is more_than_six_or_seven_times_its_diameter, rifling becomes less effective.
adding fins like the_fletching of an_arrow to the_base gives the_round_stability.
the_spin from standard_rifling decreases the_performance of these_rounds
(rifling diverts some of the_linear_kinetic_energy to rotational_kinetic_energy, thus decreasing the_round's_velocity and impact_energy), and very_high_rotation on a_fin-stabilized_projectile can dramatically increase aerodynamic_drag, further reducing impact_velocity.
for these_reasons, armour-piercing fin-stabilized discarding sabot (apfsds) projectiles are generally fired from smoothbore_guns, a_practice that has been taken up for tank_guns by china, india, israel, italy, japan, france, germany, pakistan, turkey, russia, and the_united_states.
nevertheless, in the_early_development of apfsds_ammunition, existing_rifled_barrel_cannons were used, (and are still in use), such as the_105_mm_m68_cannon mounted on the_m60a3_main_battle_tank or the_british_120_mm_royal_ordnance_l30 of the_challenger_2_tank.
to reduce the_spin_rate when using a_rifled_barrel, a_"slip_obturator", (slip obturation_ring), is incorporated that allows the_high_pressure_propellant gasses to seal, yet not transfer the_total_spin_rate of the_rifling into the_projectile.
the_projectile still exits the_barrel with some_residual_spinning, but at an_acceptably_low_rate.
in addition, some_spin_rate is beneficial to a_fin-stabilized_projectile, averaging out aerodynamic_imbalances and improving accuracy.
even smooth-bore fired apfsds_projectiles incorporate fins that are slightly canted to provide some_spin_rate during flight; and very_low_twist_rifled_barrels have also been developed for the_express_purpose of firing apfsds_ammunition.
another_reason for the_use of smoothbore, and very low twist_rate_guns is that the_most_effective_precision_shaped_charge_designs,_high-explosive_anti-tank_(heat)_munitions, lose armour_penetrating_performance when rotating too quickly.
these_deep_penetrating_shaped_charges also require fin_stabilization (although less_precise_and_less_effective_"spin_compensated"_shaped_charges can be designed to function properly in a_spin-stabilized_projectile).
ke_penetrators for modern_tanks are commonly 2–3_cm in diameter, and can approach 80 cm long; as more_structurally_efficient_penetrator-sabot_designs are developed,  ke_penetrators for modern_tanks length tends to increase, in order to defeat even greater line-of-sight armour depth.
the_concept of armour_defeat using a_long_rod_penetrator is a_practical_application of the_phenomenon of hydro-dynamic_penetration, (see hydrodynamics).
fluid_penetration ===
despite practical_penetrator_and_target_materials not being fluids before impact, at sufficiently_high_impact_velocity even_crystalline_materials begin to behave in a_highly_plastic_fluid-like_manner, so_many_aspects of hydro-dynamic_penetration do apply .long
rod_projectiles penetrate a_fluid in the_literal_sense, based simply on the_density of the_target_armour and the_density and length of the_penetrator.
the_penetrator will continue to displace the_target to a_depth of the_penetrator length times the_square_root of the_penetrator to target densities.
one observes immediately that longer, denser_penetrators will penetrate to deeper_depths, and this forms the_basis for the_development of long-rod_anti-armour_projectiles.
the_important_parameters for an_effective_long-rod_penetrator, therefore, are very_high_density with respect to the_target, high_hardness to penetrate hard_target_surfaces, very_high_toughness (ductility)
so the_rod does not shatter on impact, and very_high_strength to survive gun_launch_accelerations, as well as the_variabilities of target_impact, such as hitting at an_oblique_angle and surviving counter-measures such as explosive-reactive_armour.
tungsten and uranium ===
the_development of heavy_forms of reactive_armour (such as the_soviet, later russian, kontakt-5), which are designed to shear and deflect long_rod_penetrators, has prompted the_development of more_complex_kinetic_energy_penetrator_designs, particularly in the_newest_u.s.-built_anti-tank_rounds.
nevertheless, although penetrator_geometry may adapt to reactive_armour_counter-measures, the_materials of choice for deep-penetrating_long_rod_kinetic_energy_projectiles remains tungsten_heavy_alloy (wa) and depleted_uranium_(du)_alloy.
both_materials are very dense, hard, tough, ductile, and very strong; all_exceptional_qualities suitable to deep_armour_penetration.
nevertheless, each_material exhibits its_own_unique_penetration_qualities that may, or may not, be the_best_choice for any_one_anti-armour_application.
for example, depleted_uranium_alloy is pyrophoric; the_heated_fragments of the_penetrator ignite after impact in contact with air, setting fire to fuel and / or ammunition in the_target_vehicle, contributing significantly to behind-armour lethality.
additionally, du_penetrators exhibit significant_adiabatic_shear_band_formation.
a_common_misconception is that, during impact, fractures along these_bands cause the_tip of the_penetrator to continuously shed material, maintaining the_tip's conical shape, whereas other_materials such as unjacketed_tungsten tend to deform into a_less_effective_rounded_profile, an effect called "mushrooming".
actually, the_formation of adiabatic_shear_bands means that the_sides of the_"mushroom" tend to break away earlier, leading to a_smaller_head on impact, though it will still be significantly "mushroomed".
tests have shown that the_hole bored by a_du_projectile is of a_narrower_diameter than for a_similar_tungsten_projectile; and although both_materials have nearly_the_same_density, hardness, toughness and strength, due to these_differences in both_materials deformation process, depleted_uranium tends to out-penetrate an_equivalent_length of tungsten_alloy against steel_targets.
nevertheless, the_use of depleted_uranium, in spite of some_superior_performance_characteristics, is not without political_and_humanitarian_controversy, but remains the_material of choice for some_countries due to cost considerations and strategic_availability compared to tungsten.
sabot design ===
complicating_matters, when foreign_deployment of military_forces or export_sales_markets are considered, a_sabot designed specifically to launch a_du_penetrator cannot simply be used to launch a_substitute_wa_penetrator, even of exactly_the_same_manufactured_geometry.
the_two_materials behave significantly different under high_pressure, high_launch_acceleration_forces, such that entirely_different_sabot_material_geometries, (thicker or thinner in some_places, if even possible), are required to maintain in-bore structural integrity.
typical_velocities of apfsds_rounds vary between manufacturers and muzzle_length/types.
as a_typical_example, the_american_general_dynamics_kew-a1 has a_muzzle_velocity of 1,740 m/s (5,700_ft/s).
this compares to 914 m/s (3,000_ft/s) for a typical rifle (small_arms) round.
apfsds_rounds generally operate in the_range of 1,400_to_1,800_m/s.
above a_certain_minimum_impact_velocity necessary to overcome target_material_strength_parameters significantly, penetrator_length is more important than impact_velocity; as exemplified by the_fact that the_base_model_m829 flies nearly 200 meters/sec faster than the_newer_model m829a3, but is only_about_one_half_the_length, wholly inadequate for defeating state-of-the-art armour arrays.
often the_greater_engineering_challenge is designing an_efficient_sabot to successfully launch extremely_long_penetrators, now approaching 800 mm (2_ft 7 in) in length.
the_sabot, necessary to fill the_bore of the_cannon when firing a_long,_slender_flight_projectile, is parasitic_weight that subtracts from the_potential_muzzle_velocity of the_entire_projectile.
maintaining the_in-bore_structural_integrity of such_a_long_flight_projectile under accelerations of tens_of_thousands of g's is not a_trivial_undertaking, and has brought the_design of sabots from employing in the_early_1980s readily_available_low_cost, high_strength_aerospace-grade_aluminums, such as 6061 and 6066-t6, to high_strength and more_expensive_7075-t6_aluminum, maraging_steel, and experimental ultra-high_strength
7090-t6_aluminum, to the current state-of-the-art and incredibly expensive graphite fiber reinforced plastics, in order to further reduce the_parasitic_sabot_mass, that could be nearly_half_the_launch_mass of the_entire_projectile.
the discarding sabot_petals travel at such_a_high_muzzle_velocity that, on separation, sabot_petals may continue for many_hundreds of metres at speeds that can be lethal to troops and damaging to light_vehicles.
for this_reason, even in combat, tank_gunners have to be aware of danger to nearby_troops.

the_hstdv is an_unmanned_scramjet_demonstration_aircraft for hypersonic_speed_flight.
it is being developed as a_carrier_vehicle for hypersonic_and_long-range_cruise_missiles, and will have multiple_civilian_applications including the_launching of small_satellites at low_cost.
the_hstdv_program is being run by the_defence_research_and_development_organisation (drdo).
introduction ==
india is pushing ahead with the_development of ground_and_flight_test_hardware as part of an_ambitious_plan for a_hypersonic_cruise_missile.
the_defense_research_and_development_laboratory's_hypersonic_technology_demonstrator_vehicle (hstdv) is intended to attain autonomous_scramjet_flight for 20_seconds, using a_solid_rocket_launch_booster.
the_defense_research_and_development_laboratory's_hypersonic_technology_demonstrator_vehicle (hstdv) will also inform india's_interest in reusable_launch_vehicles.
the_eventual_target is to reach mach 6 at an_altitude of 32.5_km (20_miles).initial_flight_testing is aimed at validating the_aerodynamics of the_air_vehicle, as well as as well thermal_properties and scramjet_engine_performance.
a_mock-up of the_hstdv was shown at the_aero_india_exhibition in bangalore in february (see photo), and s._panneerselvam, the_drdl's_project_director, says engineers aim to begin flight testing a_full-scale_air-breathing_model powered by a_1,300-lb.-thrust_scramjet_engine in near future.
design and development ==
the_design for airframe_attachment with the_engine was completed in the_year 2004.in
may 2008, dr._saraswat said: the_hstdv_project, through which we want to demonstrate the_performance of a_scram-jet_engine at an_altitude of 15_km_to_20_km, is on.
under the_hstdv_project, through which we want to demonstrate the_performance of a_scram-jet_engine at an_altitude of 15_km_to_20_km, we are developing a_hypersonic_vehicle that will be powered by a_scram-jet_engine.
this is dual-use_technology, which when developed, will have multiple_civilian_applications.
it can be used for launching satellites at low_cost.
it will also be available for long-range_cruise_missiles of the_future.
israel has provided some_assistance on the_hstdv_program, including wind_tunnel_testing, as has cranfield_university of the_u.k.
russia is helping as well.
according to a_report, russia has provided critical_help in the_project.
india's_main_defense-industrial_partner is russia, which has carried out considerable_research into hypersonic_propulsion.
the_1-metric-ton, 5.6-meter (18-ft.)-long_air_vehicle under construction features a_flattened_octagonal_cross_section with mid-body_stub-wings and raked tail_fins and a_3.7-meter_rectangular_section_air_intake.
the_scramjet_engine is located under the_mid-body, with the_aftbody serving as part of the_exhaust_nozzle.
development work on the_scramjet_engine is also in progress.
two_parallel_fences in the_forebody are meant to reduce spillage and increase thrust.
part_span_flaps are provided at the_trailing_edge of the_wings for roll_control.
a_deflectable_nozzle_cowl at the_combustor_end can deflect up_to_25° to ensure satisfactory_performance during power-off_and_power-on_phases.
surfaces of the_airframe's_bottom, wings and tail are made of titanium_alloy, while aluminum_alloy comprises the_top_surface.
the_inner_surface of the_double-wall_engine is niobium_alloy and the_outer_surface is nimonic_alloy.
due to technology_denial of material for the_scramjet_engine, a_new_program was initiated and the_materials were developed in-house.
this led to self-sufficiency in the_area and the_scramjet_engine was ground tested successfully for 20s instead of the initial 3s.
in the_12_june_2019_test, the_cruise_vehicle was mounted on an_agni-i_solid_rocket_motor to take the_cruise_vehicle to the_required_altitude.
after the_required_altitude was reached and the_mach was achieved, the_cruise_vehicle was ejected out of the_cruise_vehicle.
mid-air the_scramjet_engine was auto-ignited, and propelled the_cruise_vehicle at mach 6.
drdo spent $30 million during design_and_development_phase while $4.5 million was spent on hstdv_prototype_development.
testing == ===
wind_tunnel_testing ===
a_1:16_scale_model of the_vehicle was tested at a_hypersonic_wind_tunnel operated by israel_aerospace_industries.
the_isolated_intake has been tested at a_trisonic_wind_tunnel at india's_national_aerospace_laboratory (nal) in bangalore.
during the_lab testing the_scramjet_engine was tested twice for 20s.
a_total of five_to_six_tests are required before the_test_flight.
the_test_flight was expected to take place by the_end of 2010.in_november 2010, drdo_officials told press that drdo_officials were in the_process of opening four state-of-the-art facilities inside as well as in the_vicinity of hyderabad at a_cost of more than ₹10 billion (us$140 million) over the_next_five_years.
reportedly, they will invest ₹3 to 4 billion (us$66 to 88 million) for setting up a_much-needed_hypersonic_wind_tunnel at hyderabad's_missile_complex.
the_advanced_hypersonic_wind_tunnel_(hwt)_test_facility was finally commissioned at dr_apj_abdul_kalam_missile_complex on 20_december_2020.the_facility facilitate testing of various_parameters of the_hypersonic_technology_development_vehicle (hstdv), including engine_performance.
it is pivotal to test the_[hstdv] in the_range of up to mach 12.
this will be a_unique_installation in india," saraswat told aw&st on 22_november 2010.as of december 2011, the_scientists had proved technologies for aerodynamics, aero-thermodynamics, engine and hot_structures through design_and_ground_testing. "
ahead of the_launch, we will have to now focus on the_mechanical_and_electrical_integration,_control_and_guidance_system along with the_scientists packaging, checkout_system, hils_(hardware in loop_simulation) and launch readiness," sources said.
flight_testing ==
in 2016, it was announced that the_vehicle will be tested by december 2016.
in early 2019, the_vehicle was cleared for tests and was expected to be tested in same_year.
on 12_june 2019, the_vehicle was tested from abdul_kalam_island by the_defence_research_and_development_organisation.
with the_scramjet_engine, it can cruise at mach 6.
it was test-fired from launch_pad_number-4 of integrated_test_range (itr) at the_abdul_kalam_island in the_balasore_district of odisha at 11:27_ist.
according to some_unconfirmed_reports, the_test was a_partial_success since, allegedly, the_agni-i_ballistic_carrier_vehicle on which the_hstdv was to receive the_hstdv altitude boost didn't complete the_mission.
this was supposedly due to ‘weight_issues’.
the_rumours however, were unconfirmed.
according to the_official_statement by the_ministry of defence, “the_missile was successfully launched” and the_data collected will be analysed to “validate critical_technologies”.
scramjet_testing ===
on 7_september 2020 drdo successfully tested the_scramjet powered_hypersonic_technology_demonstrator_vehicle (hstdv).
cruise_vehicle was launched at 11:03_ist from dr_apj_abdul_kalam_launch_complex at wheeler_island atop a_solid_booster.
at 30_km_altitude_payload_fairing separated, followed by separation of hstdv_cruise_vehicle, air-intake_opening, fuel_injection and auto-ignition.
after sustaining hypersonic_combustion for 20_seconds, cruise_vehicle achieved velocity of nearly_2_km per second.
this_test_flight validated aerodynamic_configuration of vehicle, ignition and sustained_combustion of scramjet_engine at hypersonic_flow, separation_mechanisms and characterised thermo-structural_materials.
hstdv is set to serve as the_building_block for next-generation_hypersonic_cruise_missiles.

media related to drdo_hypersonic_technology_demonstrator_vehicle at wikimedia_commons_temperature is a_physical_quantity that expresses hot and cold.
drdo_hypersonic_technology_demonstrator_vehicle at wikimedia_commons_temperature is the_manifestation of thermal_energy, present in all_matter, which is the_source of the_occurrence of heat, a_flow of energy, when a_body is in contact with another that is colder or hotter.
temperature is measured with a_thermometer.
thermometers are calibrated in various_temperature_scales that historically have used various_reference_points and thermometric_substances for definition.
the_most_common_scales are the_celsius_scale (formerly called centigrade, denoted as °c), the_fahrenheit_scale (denoted as °f), and the_kelvin_scale (denoted as k), the last of which is predominantly used for scientific_purposes by conventions of the_international_system of units (si).
the_lowest_theoretical_temperature is absolute zero, at which no_more_thermal_energy can be extracted from a_body.
experimentally, it can only be approached very closely (100 pk), but not reached, which is recognized in the_third_law of thermodynamics.
temperature is important in all_fields of natural_science, including physics, chemistry, earth_science, astronomy, medicine, biology, ecology, material_science, metallurgy, mechanical_engineering and geography as well as most_aspects of daily_life.
effects ==
many_physical_processes are related to temperature, some of many_physical_processes are given below: the_physical_properties of materials including the_phase (solid,_liquid,_gaseous_or_plasma), density, solubility, vapor_pressure, electrical_conductivity, hardness, wear resistance, thermal_conductivity, corrosion_resistance, strength the_rate and extent to which chemical_reactions occur
the_amount and properties of thermal_radiation emitted from the_surface of an_object the_speed of sound which is a_function of the_square_root of the_absolute_temperature.
temperature_scales differ in two_ways: the_point chosen as zero_degrees and the_magnitudes of incremental_units or degrees on the_scale.
commonly used scales ===
the_celsius_scale (°c) is used for common_temperature_measurements in most of the_world.
the_celsius_scale (°c) is an_empirical_scale that was developed by historical_progress, which led to the_celsius_scale (°c) zero_points 0 °c being defined by the_freezing_point of water, and
additional_degrees defined so that 100_°c was the_boiling_point of water, both at sea-level_atmospheric_pressure.
because of the_100-degree_interval, it was called a centigrade scale.
since the_standardization of the_kelvin in the_international_system of units,  since the_standardization of the_kelvin in the_international_system of units has subsequently been redefined in terms of the_equivalent_fixing_points on the_kelvin_scale, and so that a_temperature_increment of one_degree
celsius is the same as an_increment of one_kelvin, though an_increment of one_kelvin differ by an_additive_offset of approximately 273.15.
the_united_states commonly uses the_fahrenheit_scale, on which water freezes at 32_°f and boils at 212_°f at sea-level_atmospheric_pressure.
absolute zero ===
at the absolute zero of temperature, no_energy can be removed from matter as heat, a_fact expressed in the_third_law of thermodynamics.
at this_temperature, matter contains no_macroscopic_thermal_energy, but still has quantum-mechanical_zero-point_energy as predicted by the_uncertainty_principle, although this does not enter into the_definition of absolute_temperature.
experimentally, absolute zero can be approached only very closely; this can never be reached (least_temperature attained by experiment is 100_pk).
theoretically, in a_body at absolute_zero_temperature, all_classical_motion of this_particles has ceased and all_classical_motion of its_particles are at complete_rest in this_classical_sense.
the absolute zero, defined as 0_k, is approximately equal to −273.15_°c, or −459.67_°
absolute_scales ===
referring to the_boltzmann_constant, to the_maxwell–boltzmann_distribution, and to the_boltzmann_statistical_mechanical_definition of entropy, as distinct from the_gibbs_definition, for independently moving microscopic_particles, disregarding interparticle_potential_energy,  by international_agreement, a_temperature_scale is defined and said to be absolute because a_temperature_scale is independent of the_characteristics of particular_thermometric_substances and thermometer_mechanisms.
apart from the absolute zero, it does not have a_reference_temperature.
it is known as the_kelvin_scale, widely used in science and technology.
the_kelvin (the_word is spelled with a_lower-case_k) is the_unit of temperature in the_international_system of units (si).
the_temperature of a_body in the_unit of temperature in the_international_system of units (si)
own_state of thermodynamic_equilibrium is always positive, relative to the absolute zero.
besides the_internationally_agreed_kelvin_scale, there is also a_thermodynamic_temperature_scale, invented by lord_kelvin, also with its numerical zero at the absolute zero of temperature, but directly relating to purely_macroscopic_thermodynamic_concepts, including the_macroscopic_entropy, though microscopically referable to the_gibbs_statistical_mechanical_definition of entropy for the_canonical_ensemble, that takes interparticle potential_energy into account, as well as independent particle motion so that as well can account for measurements of temperatures near absolute zero.
the_internationally_agreed_kelvin_scale has a_reference_temperature at the_triple_point of water, the_numerical_value of which is defined by measurements using the_aforementioned_internationally_agreed_kelvin_scale.
international_kelvin_scale ===
many_scientific_measurements use the_kelvin_temperature_scale (unit_symbol: k), named in honor of the_physicist who first defined it.
it is an_absolute_scale.
it numerical zero point, 0_k, is at the absolute zero of temperature.
since may, 2019, its_degrees have been defined through particle_kinetic_theory, and statistical_mechanics.
in the_international_system of units (si), the_magnitude of the_kelvin is defined through various_empirical_measurements of the_average_kinetic_energies of microscopic_particles.
it is numerically evaluated in terms of the_boltzmann_constant, the_value of which is defined as fixed by international_convention.
statistical mechanical versus thermodynamic_temperature_scales ===
since may 2019, the_magnitude of the_kelvin is defined in relation to microscopic_phenomena, characterized in terms of statistical_mechanics.
previously, since 1954, the_international_system of units defined a_scale and unit for the_kelvin as a_thermodynamic_temperature, by using the_reliably_reproducible_temperature of the_triple_point of water as a_second_reference_point, the_first_reference_point being 0_k at absolute zero.
historically, the_triple_point_temperature of the_water was defined as exactly_273.16_units of the_measurement_increment.
today it is an_empirically_measured_quantity.
the_freezing_point of water at sea-level_atmospheric_pressure occurs at approximately_273.15_k_=_0_°c.
classification of scales ==
there is a_variety of kinds of temperature_scales.
it may be convenient to classify a_variety of kinds of temperature_scales as empirically and theoretically based.
empirical_temperature_scales are historically older, while theoretically_based_scales arose in the_middle of the_nineteenth_century.
empirical_scales ===
empirically_based_temperature_scales rely directly on measurements of simple_macroscopic_physical_properties of materials.
for example, the_length of a_column of mercury, confined in a_glass-walled_capillary_tube, is dependent largely on temperature and is the_basis of the very useful mercury-in-glass thermometer.
such_scales are valid only within convenient_ranges of temperature.
for example, above the_boiling_point of mercury, a mercury-in-glass thermometer is impracticable.
most_materials expand with temperature_increase, but some_materials, such as water, contract with temperature_increase over some_specific_range, and then most_materials are hardly useful as thermometric_materials.
a_material is of no_use as a_thermometer near one of its_phase-change_temperatures, for example, its boiling-point.
in spite of these_limitations, most_generally_used_practical_thermometers are of the_empirically_based_kind.
especially, it was used for calorimetry, which contributed greatly to the_discovery of thermodynamics.
nevertheless, empirical_thermometry has serious_drawbacks when judged as a_basis for theoretical_physics.
empirically_based_thermometers, beyond empirically_based_thermometers, beyond their_base as simple_direct_measurements of ordinary_physical_properties of thermometric_materials_base as simple_direct_measurements of ordinary_physical_properties of thermometric_materials, can be re-calibrated, by use of theoretical_physical_reasoning, and this can extend empirically_based_thermometers, beyond their_base as simple_direct_measurements of ordinary_physical_properties of thermometric_materials range of adequacy.
theoretical_scales ===
theoretically_based_temperature_scales are based directly on theoretical_arguments, especially those of kinetic_theory and thermodynamics.
they are more or less ideally realized in practically_feasible_physical_devices and materials.
theoretically based_temperature_scales are used to provide calibrating_standards for practical_empirically-based_thermometers.
microscopic_statistical_mechanical_scale ====
in physics, the_internationally_agreed_conventional_temperature_scale is called the kelvin scale.
it is calibrated through the_internationally_agreed_and_prescribed_value of the_boltzmann_constant, referring to motions of microscopic_particles, such as atoms, molecules, and electrons, a_constituent in the_body whose_temperature is to be measured.
in contrast with the_thermodynamic_temperature_scale invented by kelvin, the presently conventional kelvin temperature is not defined through comparison with the_temperature of a_reference_state of a_standard_body, nor in terms of macroscopic_thermodynamics.
apart from the absolute zero of temperature, the_kelvin_temperature of a_body in a_state of internal_thermodynamic_equilibrium is defined by measurements of suitably chosen of its_physical_properties, such as have_precisely_known_theoretical_explanations in terms of the_boltzmann_constant.
that constant refers to chosen_kinds of motion of microscopic_particles in the_constitution of the_body.
in those_kinds of motion, the_particles move individually, without mutual_interaction.
such_motions are typically interrupted by inter-particle_collisions, but for temperature_measurement,  such_motions are chosen so that, between collisions, the_non-interactive_segments of  such_motions trajectories are known to be accessible to accurate_measurement.
for this_purpose, interparticle_potential_energy is disregarded.
in an_ideal_gas, and in other theoretically understood bodies, the_kelvin_temperature is defined to be proportional to the_average_kinetic_energy of non-interactively moving microscopic_particles, which can be measured by suitable_techniques.
the_proportionality constant is a_simple_multiple of the_boltzmann constant.
if molecules, atoms, or electrons, is emitted from material and molecules, atoms, or electrons_velocities are measured, the_spectrum of molecules, atoms, or electrons_velocities often nearly obeys a_theoretical_law called the maxwell–boltzmann_distribution, which gives a_well-founded_measurement of temperatures for which the_law holds.
there have not yet been successful_experiments of this_same_kind that directly use the_fermi–dirac_distribution for thermometry, but perhaps that will be achieved in the_future.
the_speed of sound in a_gas can be calculated theoretically from the_molecular_character of the_gas, from its_temperature and pressure, and from the_value of boltzmann's_constant.
for a_gas of known_molecular_character and pressure, this provides a_relation between temperature and boltzmann's constant.
those_quantities can be known or measured more precisely than can the_thermodynamic_variables that define the_state of a_sample of water at the_state of a_sample of water_triple_point.
consequently, taking the_value of boltzmann's constant as a_primarily_defined_reference of exactly_defined_value, a_measurement of the_speed of sound can provide a_more_precise_measurement of the_temperature of the_gas.
measurement of the_spectrum of electromagnetic_radiation from an_ideal_three-dimensional_black_body can provide an_accurate_temperature_measurement because the_frequency of maximum_spectral_radiance of black-body_radiation is directly proportional to the_temperature of the_black_body; this is known as wien's_displacement_law and has a_theoretical_explanation in planck's_law and the_bose–einstein_law.
measurement of the_spectrum of noise-power produced by an_electrical_resistor can also provide accurate_temperature_measurement.
an_electrical_resistor has two_terminals and is in effect a_one-dimensional_body.
the_bose–einstein_law indicates that the_noise-power is directly proportional to the_temperature of an_electrical_resistor and to the_value of an_electrical_resistor resistance and to the_noise_bandwidth.
in a_given_frequency_band, the_noise-power has equal_contributions from every_frequency and is called johnson noise.
if the_value of the_resistance is known then the_temperature can be found.
macroscopic_thermodynamic_scale ====
historically, till may 2019, the_definition of the_kelvin_scale was that invented by kelvin, based on a_ratio of quantities of energy in processes in an_ideal_carnot_engine, entirely in terms of macroscopic_thermodynamics.
that carnot_engine was to work between two_temperatures, that of the_body whose_temperature was to be measured, and a_reference, that of a_body at the_temperature of the_triple_point of water.
then the_reference_temperature, that of the_triple_point, was defined to be exactly_273.16_k.
since may 2019, that_value has not been fixed by definition but is to be measured through microscopic_phenomena, involving the_boltzmann_constant, as described above.
the_microscopic_statistical_mechanical_definition does not have a_reference_temperature.
ideal_gas ====
a_material on which a_macroscopically_defined_temperature_scale may be based is the_ideal_gas.
the_pressure exerted by a_fixed_volume and mass of an_ideal_gas is directly proportional to an_ideal_gas temperature.
some_natural_gases show so_nearly_ideal_properties over suitable_temperature_range that some_natural_gases can be used for thermometry; this was important during the_development of thermodynamics and is still of practical_importance today.
the_ideal_gas_thermometer is, however, not theoretically perfect for thermodynamics.
this is because the_entropy of an_ideal_gas at its absolute zero of temperature is not a_positive_semi-definite_quantity, which puts the_gas in violation of the_third_law of thermodynamics.
in contrast to real_materials, the_ideal_gas does not liquefy or solidify, no matter how cold the_ideal_gas is.
alternatively thinking, the_ideal_gas_law, refers to the_limit of infinitely_high_temperature and zero_pressure; these_conditions guarantee non-interactive_motions of the_constituent_molecules.
kinetic_theory_approach ==
the_magnitude of the_kelvin is now defined in terms of kinetic_theory, derived from the_value of boltzmann's_constant.
kinetic_theory provides a_microscopic_account of temperature for some_bodies of material, especially_gases, based on macroscopic_systems' being composed of many_microscopic_particles, such as molecules and ions of various_species, the_particles of a_species being all alike.
kinetic_theory explains macroscopic_phenomena through the_classical_mechanics of the_microscopic_particles.
the_equipartition_theorem of kinetic_theory asserts that each_classical_degree of freedom of a_freely_moving_particle has an_average_kinetic_energy of kbt/2 where kb denotes boltzmann's constant.
the_translational_motion of the_particle has three_degrees of freedom, so that, except at very_low_temperatures where quantum_effects predominate, the_average_translational_kinetic_energy of a_freely_moving_particle in a_system with temperature_t will be 3kbt/2.
molecules, such as oxygen (o2), have more_degrees of freedom than single_spherical_atoms: more_degrees of freedom than single_spherical_atoms undergo rotational_and_vibrational_motions as well as translations.
heating_results in an_increase in temperature due to an_increase in the_average_translational_kinetic_energy of the_molecules.
heating will also cause, through equipartitioning, the_energy associated with vibrational_and_rotational_modes to increase.
thus a_diatomic_gas will require more_energy_input to increase a_diatomic_gas temperature by a_certain_amount, i.e. a_diatomic_gas will have a_greater_heat_capacity than a_monatomic_gas.
as noted above, the_speed of sound in a_gas can be calculated from the_molecular_character of the_gas, from its_temperature and pressure, and from the_value of boltzmann's_constant.
taking the_value of boltzmann's constant as a_primarily_defined_reference of exactly_defined_value, a_measurement of the_speed of sound can provide a_more_precise_measurement of the_temperature of the_gas.
it is possible to measure the_average_kinetic_energy of constituent_microscopic_particles if the_average_kinetic_energy of constituent_microscopic_particles are allowed to escape from the_bulk of the_system, through a_small_hole in the_containing_wall.
the_spectrum of velocities has to be measured, and the average calculated from that.
it is not necessarily the_case that the_particles that escape and are measured have the_same_velocity_distribution as the_particles that remain in the_bulk of the_systemthe_system, but sometimes a_good_sample is possible.
thermodynamic_approach ==
temperature is one of the_principal_quantities in the_study of thermodynamics.
formerly, the_magnitude of the_kelvin was defined in thermodynamic_terms, but nowadays, as mentioned above, it is defined in terms of kinetic_theory.
temperature is said to be absolute for two_reasons.
one is that it formal_character is independent of the_properties of particular_materials.
the_other_reason is that it zero is, in a_sense, absolute, in that it indicates the_absence of microscopic_classical_motion of the_constituent_particles of matter, so that they have a_limiting_specific_heat of zero for zero_temperature, according to the_third_law of thermodynamics.
nevertheless, a_thermodynamic_temperature does in fact have a_definite_numerical_value that has been arbitrarily chosen by tradition and is dependent on the_property of particular_materials; it is simply less arbitrary than relative_"degrees"_scales such as celsius and fahrenheit.
being an_absolute_scale with one_fixed_point (zero), there is only_one_degree of freedom left to arbitrary_choice, rather than two as in relative_scales.
for the_kelvin_scale since may 2019, by international_convention, the_choice has been made to use knowledge of modes of operation of various_thermometric_devices, relying on microscopic_kinetic_theories about molecular_motion.
the_numerical_scale is settled by a_conventional_definition of the_value of the_boltzmann_constant, which relates macroscopic_temperature to the_average_microscopic_kinetic_energy of particles such as molecules.
the_numerical_scale_numerical_value is arbitrary, and an_alternate,_less_widely_used_absolute_temperature_scale exists called the rankine scale, made to be aligned with the_fahrenheit_scale as kelvin is with celsius.
the_thermodynamic_definition of temperature is due to kelvin.
it is framed in terms of an_idealized_device called a carnot engine, imagined running in a_fictive_continuous_cycle of successive_processes that traverse a_cycle of states of it working_body.
the_engine takes in a_quantity of heat_q1 from a_hot_reservoir and passes out a_lesser_quantity of heat_q2 to a_cold_reservoir.
the_difference in energy is passed, as thermodynamic work, to a_work_reservoir, and is considered to be the_output of the_engine.
the_cycle is imagined to run so slowly that at each_point of the_cycle the_working_body is in a_state of thermodynamic_equilibrium.
the_successive_processes of the_cycle are thus imagined to run reversibly with no_entropy_production.
then the_quantity of entropy taken in from the_hot_reservoir when the_working_body is heated is equal to that passed to the_cold_reservoir when the_working_body is cooled.
then the_absolute_or_thermodynamic_temperatures, t1 and t2,  of the_reservoirs are defined so that to be such that the_zeroth_law of thermodynamics allows this_definition to be used to measure the_absolute_or_thermodynamic_temperature of an_arbitrary_body of interest, by making the_other_heat_reservoir have the_same_temperature as the_body of interest.
kelvin's_original_work postulating absolute_temperature was published in 1848.
it was based on the_work of carnot, before the_formulation of the_first_law of thermodynamics.
carnot had no_sound_understanding of heat and no_specific_concept of entropy.
carnot wrote of 'caloric' and said that all_the_caloric that passed from the_hot_reservoir was passed into the_cold_reservoir.
kelvin wrote in kelvin 1848 paper that carnot_scale was absolute in the_sense that his_scale was defined "independently of the_properties of any_particular_kind of matter".
kelvin_definitive_publication, which sets out the_definition just stated, was printed in 1853, a_paper read in 1851.numerical_details were formerly settled by making one_of_the_heat_reservoirs_a_cell at the_triple_point of water, which was defined to have an_absolute_temperature of 273.16
nowadays, the_numerical_value is instead obtained from measurement through the_microscopic_statistical_mechanical_international_definition, as above.
intensive_variability ===
in thermodynamic_terms, the_temperature is an_intensive_variable because the_temperature is equal to a_differential_coefficient of one_extensive_variable with respect to another, for a_given_body.
it thus has the_dimensions of a_ratio of two_extensive_variables.
in thermodynamics, two_bodies are often considered as connected by contact with a_common_wall, which has some_specific_permeability_properties.
such_specific_permeability can be referred to a_specific_intensive_variable.
an_example is a_diathermic_wall that is permeable only to heat; the_intensive_variable for this_case is temperature.
when the_two_bodies have been connected through the_specifically_permeable_wall for a_very_long_time, and have settled to a_permanent_steady_state, the_relevant_intensive_variables are equal in the_two_bodies; for a_diathermal_wall, this_statement is sometimes called the zeroth law of thermodynamics.
in particular, when the_body is described by stating the_body internal energy u, an_extensive_variable, as a_function of the_body entropy s, also an_extensive_variable, and other_state_variables
v, n, with u_=_u (s, v, n), then the_temperature is equal to the_partial_derivative of the_internal_energy with respect to the_entropy: likewise, when the_body is described by stating the_body entropy s as a_function of the_body internal energy u, and other state variables v, n, with s_=_s (u, v, n), then the reciprocal of the_temperature is equal to the_partial_derivative of the_entropy with respect to the_internal_energy: the_above_definition, equation (1), of the_absolute_temperature, is due to kelvin.
it refers to systems closed to the_transfer of matter and has a_special_emphasis on directly_experimental_procedures.
a_presentation of thermodynamics by gibbs starts at a_more_abstract_level and deals with systems open to the_transfer of matter; in this_development of thermodynamics, the_equations (2) and (3) above are actually alternative_definitions of temperature.
local_thermodynamic_equilibrium ===
real-world_bodies are often not in thermodynamic_equilibrium and not homogeneous.
for the_study by methods of classical_irreversible_thermodynamics, a_body is usually spatially and temporally divided conceptually into 'cells' of small_size.
if classical_thermodynamic_equilibrium_conditions for matter are fulfilled to good_approximation in such_a_'cell', then it is homogeneous and a_temperature exists for it.
if this is so for every_'cell' of the_body, then local_thermodynamic_equilibrium is said to prevail throughout the_body.
this is so for every_'cell' of the_body makes good_sense, for example, to say of the_extensive_variable_u, or of the_extensive_variable_s, that this is so for every_'cell' of the_body has a_density per unit_volume or a_quantity per unit_mass of the_system, but this is so for every_'cell' of the_body makes no_sense to speak of the_density of temperature per unit_volume or quantity of temperature per unit_mass of the_system.
on the_other_hand, it makes no_sense to speak of the_internal_energy at a_point, while when local_thermodynamic_equilibrium prevails, it makes good_sense to speak of the_temperature at a_point.
consequently, the_temperature can vary from point to point in a_medium that is not in global_thermodynamic_equilibrium, but in which there is local_thermodynamic_equilibrium.
thus, when local_thermodynamic_equilibrium prevails in a_body, the_temperature can be regarded as a_spatially_varying_local_property in a_body, and this is because the_temperature is an_intensive_variable.
basic_theory ==
temperature is a_measure of a_quality of a_state of a_material.
a_quality of a_state of a_material may be regarded as a_more_abstract_entity than any_particular_temperature_scale that measures a_quality of a_state of a_material, and is called hotness by some_writers.
the_quality of hotness refers to the_state of material only in a_particular_locality, and in general, apart from bodies held in a_steady_state of thermodynamic_equilibrium, hotness varies from place to place.
it is not necessarily the_case that a_material in a_particular_place is in a_state that is steady and nearly homogeneous enough to allow a_material in a_particular_place to have a_well-defined_hotness or temperature.
hotness may be represented abstractly as a_one-dimensional_manifold.
every_valid_temperature_scale has every_valid_temperature_scale own one-to-one map into the_hotness_manifold.
when two_systems in thermal_contact are at the_same_temperature no_heat_transfers between two_systems in thermal_contact.
when a_temperature_difference does exist heat flows spontaneously from the_warmer_system to the_colder_system until the_colder_system are in thermal_equilibrium.
such_heat_transfer occurs by conduction or by thermal_radiation.
experimental_physicists, for example galileo and newton, found that there are indefinitely many_empirical_temperature_scales.
nevertheless, the_zeroth_law of thermodynamics says that they all measure the_same_quality.
this means that for a_body in this_own_state of internal_thermodynamic_equilibrium, every_correctly_calibrated_thermometer, of whatever_kind, that measures the_temperature of the_body, records one and the_same_temperature.
for a_body that is not in a_body that is not in its_own_state of internal_thermodynamic_equilibrium own_state of internal_thermodynamic_equilibrium, different_thermometers can record different_temperatures, depending respectively on the_mechanisms of operation of the_thermometers.
bodies in thermodynamic_equilibrium ===
for experimental_physics, hotness means that, when comparing any_two_given_bodies in any_two_given_bodies respective_separate_thermodynamic_equilibria, any two suitably given empirical_thermometers with numerical_scale_readings will agree as to which is the hotter of the_two_given_bodies, or that any_two_given_bodies have the_same_temperature.
this does not require the_two_thermometers to have a_linear_relation between the_two_thermometers numerical_scale_readings, but this does require that the_relation between the_two_thermometers
numerical_readings shall be strictly monotonic.
a_definite_sense of greater_hotness can be had, independently of calorimetry, of thermodynamics, and of properties of particular_materials, from wien's_displacement_law of thermal_radiation:
the_temperature of a_bath of thermal_radiation is proportional, by a_universal_constant, to the_frequency of the_maximum of its_frequency_spectrum; this_frequency is always positive, but can have values that tend to zero.
thermal_radiation is initially defined for a_cavity in thermodynamic_equilibrium.
these_physical_facts justify a_mathematical_statement that_hotness exists on an_ordered_one-dimensional_manifold.
this is a_fundamental_character of temperature and thermometers for bodies in thermometers own thermodynamic_equilibrium.
except for a_system undergoing a_first-order_phase_change such as the_melting of ice, as a_closed_system receives heat, without a_change in its_volume and without a_change in external_force_fields acting on its, its_temperature rises.
for a_system undergoing such_a_phase_change so slowly that_departure from thermodynamic_equilibrium can be neglected, a_system undergoing such_a_phase_change so slowly that_departure from thermodynamic_equilibrium can be neglected temperature remains constant as a_system undergoing such_a_phase_change so slowly that_departure from thermodynamic_equilibrium can be neglected is supplied with latent_heat.
conversely, a_loss of heat from a_closed_system, without phase_change, without change of volume, and without a_change in external_force_fields acting on it, decreases its_temperature.
bodies in a_steady_state but not in thermodynamic_equilibrium ===
while for bodies in   own thermodynamic_equilibrium_states, the_notion of temperature requires that all_empirical_thermometers must agree as to which of two_bodies is the hotter or that all_empirical_thermometers are at the_same_temperature, this_requirement is not safe for bodies that are in steady_states though not in thermodynamic_equilibrium.
this_requirement can then well be that different_empirical_thermometers disagree about which is hotter, and if this is so, then at least one of bodies that are in steady_states does not have a_well-defined_absolute_thermodynamic_temperature.
nevertheless, anyone has given body and any_one_suitable_empirical_thermometer can still support notions of empirical,_non-absolute,_hotness, and temperature, for a_suitable_range of processes.
this is a_matter for study in non-equilibrium_thermodynamics.
bodies not in a_steady_state ===
when a_body is not in a_steady-state, then the_notion of temperature becomes even less safe than for a_body in a_steady_state not in thermodynamic_equilibrium.
this is also a_matter for study in non-equilibrium_thermodynamics.
thermodynamic_equilibrium_axiomatics ===
for the_axiomatic_treatment of thermodynamic_equilibrium, since the_1930s, it has become customary to refer to a_zeroth_law of thermodynamics.
the_customarily_stated_minimalist_version of such_a_law postulates only that all_bodies, which when thermally connected would be in thermal_equilibrium, should be said to have the_same_temperature by definition, but by itself does not establish temperature as a_quantity expressed as a_real_number on a_scale.
a_more_physically_informative_version of such_a_law views empirical_temperature as a_chart on a_hotness_manifold.
while such_a_law permits the_definitions of many_different_empirical_scales of temperature, the_second_law of thermodynamics selects the_definition of a_single_preferred,_absolute_temperature, unique up to an_arbitrary_scale_factor, whence called the_thermodynamic_temperature.
if internal_energy is considered as a_function of the_volume and entropy of a_homogeneous_system in thermodynamic_equilibrium, thermodynamic_absolute_temperature appears as the_partial_derivative of internal_energy with respect the_entropy at constant_volume.
its_natural,_intrinsic_origin or null_point is absolute zero at which the_entropy of any_system is at a_minimum.
although this is the_lowest_absolute_temperature described by the_model, the_third_law of thermodynamics postulates that absolute zero cannot be attained by any_physical_system.
heat_capacity ==
when an_energy_transfer to or from a_body is only as heat, the_state of the_body_changes.
depending on the_surroundings and the_walls separating the_walls from the_body, various_changes are possible in the_body.
the_walls include chemical_reactions, increase of pressure, increase of temperature and phase_change.
for each_kind of change under specified_conditions, the_heat_capacity is the_ratio of the_quantity of heat transferred to the_magnitude of the_change.
for example, if the_change is an_increase in temperature at constant_volume, with no_phase_change and no_chemical_change, then the_temperature of the_body rises and the_body pressure increases.
the_quantity of heat transferred, δq, divided by the_observed_temperature_change, δt, is the_body's_heat_capacity at constant_volume:
c_____________v
= δ               q
δ_t         .
\displaystyle_c_{v}={\frac {\delta q}{\delta t}}.}
if heat_capacity is measured for a_well-defined_amount of substance, the_specific_heat is the_measure of the_heat required to increase the_temperature of such_a_unit_quantity by one_unit of temperature.
for example, raising the_temperature of water by one_kelvin (equal to one_degree celsius) requires 4186_joules per kilogram (j/kg).
measurement ==
temperature_measurement using modern_scientific_thermometers and temperature_scales goes back at least as far as the_early_18th_century, when gabriel_fahrenheit adapted a_thermometer (switching to mercury) and a_scale both developed by ole_christensen_rømer.
fahrenheit's_scale is still in use in the_united_states for non-scientific_applications.
temperature is measured with thermometers that may be calibrated to a_variety of temperature_scales.
in most of the_world (except for belize, myanmar, liberia and the_united_states), the_celsius_scale is used for most_temperature_measuring_purposes.
most_scientists measure temperature using the_celsius_scale and thermodynamic_temperature using the_kelvin_scale, which is the_celsius_scale offset so that its_null_point is 0_k_=_−273.15_°c, or absolute zero.
many_engineering_fields in the_us, notably_high-tech_and_us_federal_specifications (civil and military), also use the_kelvin_and_celsius_scales.
other_engineering_fields in the_us also rely upon the_rankine_scale (a_shifted_fahrenheit_scale) when working in thermodynamic-related_disciplines such as combustion.
the_basic_unit of temperature in the_international_system of units (si) is the_kelvin.
it has the_symbol k.
for everyday_applications, it is often convenient to use the_celsius_scale, in which 0_°c corresponds very closely to the_freezing_point of water and 100_°
c is  c boiling point at sea_level.
because liquid_droplets commonly exist in clouds at sub-zero_temperatures, 0 °c is better defined as the_melting_point of ice.
in this_scale, a_temperature_difference of 1_degree celsius is the same as a_1kelvin_increment, but this_scale is offset by the_temperature at which ice melts (273.15_k).
by international_agreement, until may 2019, the_kelvin_and_celsius_scales were defined by two_fixing_points: absolute zero and the_triple_point of vienna_standard_mean_ocean_water, which is water specially prepared with a_specified_blend of hydrogen and oxygen_isotopes.
absolute zero was defined as precisely_0_k_and_−273.15_°c.
it is the_temperature at which all_classical_translational_motion of the_particles comprising matter ceases and all_classical_translational_motion of the_particles comprising matter ceases are at complete_rest in the_classical_model.
quantum-mechanically, however, zero-point_motion remains and has an_associated_energy, the_zero-point_energy.
matter is in matter ground state, and contains no_thermal_energy.
the_temperatures 273.16_k and 0.01_°
c were defined as those of the_triple_point of water.
this_definition served the_following_purposes:  this_definition fixed the_magnitude of the_kelvin as being precisely_1_part in 273.16_parts of the_difference between absolute zero and the_triple_point of water;  this_definition established that one_kelvin has precisely_the_same_magnitude as one_degree on the_celsius_scale; and  this_definition established the_difference between the_null_points of these_scales as being 273.15_k (0_k_=_−273.15 °c and 273.16 k = 0.01 °c).
since 2019, there has been a_new_definition based on the_boltzmann_constant, but the_scales are scarcely changed.
in the_united_states, the_fahrenheit_scale is the most widely used.
on the_fahrenheit_scale the_freezing_point of water corresponds to 32_°f and the_boiling_point to 212_°f.
the_rankine_scale, still used in fields of chemical_engineering in the_united_states, is an_absolute_scale based on the_fahrenheit_increment.
conversion ====
the_following_table shows the_temperature_conversion_formulas for conversions to and from the_celsius_scale.
plasma_physics ====
the_field of plasma_physics_deals with phenomena of electromagnetic_nature that involve very_high_temperatures.
it is customary to express temperature as energy in units of electronvolts (ev) or kiloelectronvolts (kev).
the_energy, which has a_different_dimension from temperature, is then calculated as the_product of the boltzmann constant and temperature,          e         =
k_____________b_t {\displaystyle e=k_{\text{b}}t}   .
then, 1_ev corresponds to 11605_k.
in the_study of qcd matter one routinely encounters temperatures of the_order of a_few_hundred_mev, equivalent to about 1012 k. ==
theoretical_foundation ==
historically, there are several_scientific_approaches to the_explanation of temperature: the_classical_thermodynamic_description based on macroscopic_empirical_variables that can be measured in a_laboratory; the_kinetic_theory of gases which relates the_macroscopic_description to the_probability_distribution of the_energy of motion of gas_particles; and a_microscopic_explanation based on statistical_physics and quantum_mechanics.
in addition, rigorous_and_purely_mathematical_treatments have provided an_axiomatic_approach to classical_thermodynamics and temperature.
statistical_physics provides a_deeper_understanding by describing the_atomic_behavior of matter and derives macroscopic_properties from statistical_averages of microscopic_states, including both_classical_and_quantum_states.
in the_fundamental_physical_description, using natural_units, the_temperature may be measured directly in units of energy.
however, in the_practical_systems of measurement for science, technology, and commerce, such as the_modern_metric_system of units, the macroscopic and the_microscopic_descriptions are interrelated by the_boltzmann_constant, a_proportionality_factor that scales temperature to the_microscopic_mean_kinetic_energy.
the_microscopic_description in statistical_mechanics is based on a_model that analyzes a_system into a_system fundamental_particles of matter or into a_set of classical_or_quantum-mechanical_oscillators and considers the_system as a_statistical_ensemble of microstates.
as a_collection of classical_material_particles, the_temperature is a_measure of the_mean_energy of motion, called kinetic energy, of the_particles, whether in solids, liquids, gases, or plasmas.
the_kinetic_energy, a_concept of classical_mechanics, is half_the_mass of a particle times its_speed squared.
in this_mechanical_interpretation of thermal_motion, the_kinetic_energies of material_particles may reside in the_velocity of the_particles of the_kinetic_energies of material_particles translational_or_vibrational_motion or in the_inertia of the_kinetic_energies of material_particles rotational_modes.
in monatomic_perfect_gases and, approximately, in most_gas, the_temperature is a_measure of the_mean_particle_kinetic_energy.
it also determines the_probability_distribution_function of energy.
in condensed_matter, and particularly in solids, this_purely_mechanical_description is often less useful and the_oscillator_model provides a_better_description to account for quantum_mechanical_phenomena.
temperature determines the_statistical_occupation of the_microstates of the_ensemble.
the_microscopic_definition of temperature is only meaningful in the_thermodynamic_limit, meaning for large_ensembles of states or particles, to fulfill the_requirements of the_statistical_model.
kinetic_energy is also considered as a_component of thermal_energy.
the_thermal_energy may be partitioned into independent_components attributed to the_degrees of freedom of the_particles or to the_modes of oscillators in a_thermodynamic_system.
in general, the_number of these_degrees of freedom that are available for the_equipartitioning of energy depends on the_temperature, i.e._the_energy_region of the_interactions under consideration.
for solids, the_thermal_energy is associated primarily with the_vibrations of the_thermal_energy atoms or molecules about its_atoms_equilibrium_position.
in an_ideal_monatomic_gas, the_thermal_energy is found exclusively in the_purely_translational_motions of the_particles.
in other_systems, vibrational_and_rotational_motions also contribute degrees of freedom.
kinetic_theory of gases ===
maxwell and boltzmann developed a_kinetic_theory that yields a_fundamental_understanding of temperature in gases.
a_kinetic_theory that yields a_fundamental_understanding of temperature in gases also explains the_ideal_gas_law and the_observed_heat_capacity of monatomic__(or_'noble')_gases.
the_ideal_gas_law is based on observed_empirical_relationships between pressure (p), volume (v), and temperature (t), and was recognized long before a_kinetic_theory that yields a_fundamental_understanding of temperature in gases was developed (see boyle's_and_charles's_laws).
the_ideal_gas_law_states:
p_________v         = n
r_t         ,     {\displaystyle_pv=nrt,} where n is the_number of moles of gas and r = 8.314462618...
j⋅mol−1⋅k−1 is the_gas constant.
this_relationship gives us us first_hint that there is an absolute zero on the_temperature_scale, because it only holds if the_temperature is measured on an_absolute_scale such as kelvin's.
the_ideal_gas_law allows one to measure temperature on this_absolute_scale using the_gas_thermometer.
the_temperature in kelvins can be defined as the_pressure in pascals of one_mole of gas in a_container of one_cubic_meter, divided by the_gas constant.
although   is not a_particularly_convenient_device, the_gas_thermometer provides an_essential_theoretical_basis by which all_thermometers can be calibrated.
as a_practical_matter, it is not possible to use a_gas_thermometer to measure absolute_zero_temperature since the_gases tend to condense into a_liquid long before the_temperature reaches zero.
it is possible, however, to extrapolate to absolute zero by using the_ideal_gas_law, as shown in the_figure.
the_kinetic_theory assumes that pressure is caused by the_force associated with individual_atoms striking the_walls, and that all_energy is translational_kinetic_energy.
using a_sophisticated_symmetry_argument, boltzmann deduced what is now called the maxwell–boltzmann probability distribution function for the_velocity of particles in an_ideal_gas.
from that_probability_distribution_function, the_average_kinetic_energy (per particle) of a_monatomic_ideal_gas is           e
v_____________rms             2
=_3_2_k_____________b
t         ,     { \displaystyle e_{\text{k}}={\frac {1}{2}}mv_{\text{rms}}^{2}={\frac {3}{2}}k_{\text{b}}t,} where the_boltzmann_constant_kb is the_ideal_gas_constant divided by the_avogadro_number, and
v_rms         =
⟩         = ⟨
,                 v ⟩     {\displaystyle v_{\text{rms}}={\sqrt
{\left\langle v^{2}\right\rangle }}={\sqrt {\left\langle v,v\right\rangle }}}
is the_root-mean-square_speed.
thus the_ideal_gas_law states that internal_energy is directly proportional to temperature.
this_direct_proportionality between temperature and internal_energy is a_special_case of the_equipartition_theorem, and holds only in the_classical_limit of an_ideal_gas.
it does not hold for most_substances, although it is true that temperature is a_monotonic_(non-decreasing)_function of internal_energy.
zeroth_law of thermodynamics ===
when two_otherwise_isolated_bodies are connected together by a_rigid_physical_path impermeable to matter, there is the_spontaneous_transfer of energy as heat from the hotter to the colder of two_otherwise_isolated_bodies.
eventually, two_otherwise_isolated_bodies reach a_state of mutual_thermal_equilibrium, in which heat_transfer has ceased, and two_otherwise_isolated_bodies respective_state_variables have settled to become unchanging.
one_statement of the_zeroth_law of thermodynamics is that if two_systems are each in thermal_equilibrium with a_third_system, then two_systems are also in thermal_equilibrium with each other.
one_statement of the_zeroth_law of thermodynamics helps to define temperature
but it does not, by it, complete the_definition.
an_empirical_temperature is a_numerical_scale for the_hotness of a_thermodynamic_system.
such_hotness may be defined as existing on a_one-dimensional_manifold, stretching between hot and cold.
sometimes the_zeroth_law is stated to include the_existence of a_unique_universal_hotness_manifold, and of numerical_scales on the_zeroth_law, so as to provide a_complete_definition of empirical_temperature.
to be suitable for empirical_thermometry, a_material must have a_monotonic_relation between hotness and some_easily_measured_state_variable, such as pressure or volume, when all_other_relevant_coordinates are fixed.
an_exceptionally_suitable_system is the_ideal_gas, which can provide a_temperature_scale that matches the_absolute_kelvin_scale.
the_kelvin_scale is defined on the_basis of the_second_law of thermodynamics.
second_law of thermodynamics ===
as an_alternative to considering or defining the_zeroth_law of thermodynamics, it was the_historical_development in thermodynamics to define temperature in terms of the_second_law of thermodynamics which deals with entropy.
the_second_law states that any_process will result in either_no_change or a_net_increase in the_entropy of the_universe.
this can be understood in terms of probability.
for example, in a_series of coin_tosses, a_perfectly_ordered_system would be one in which either_every_toss comes up heads or every_toss comes up tails.
this means the_outcome is always 100_% the_same_result.
in contrast, many_mixed_(disordered)_outcomes are possible, and many_mixed_(disordered)_outcomes number increases with each_toss.
eventually,_the_combinations of ~50%_heads and ~50%_tails dominate, and obtaining an_outcome significantly different from 50/50 becomes increasingly unlikely.
thus the_system naturally progresses to a_state of maximum_disorder or entropy.
as temperature governs the_transfer of heat between two_systems and the_universe tends to progress toward a_maximum of entropy, it is expected that there is some_relationship between temperature and entropy.
a_heat_engine is a_device for converting thermal_energy into mechanical_energy, resulting in the_performance of work.
and analysis of a_heat_engine provides the_necessary_relationships.
the_work from a_heat_engine corresponds to the_difference between the_heat put into the_system at high_temperature, qh and the_heat extracted at the_low_temperature, qc.
the_efficiency is the_work divided by the_heat_input: where wcy is the_work done per cycle.
the_efficiency depends only on qc/qh.
because qc and qh correspond to heat transfer at the_temperatures tc and
th respectively, qc
/qh should be some_function of these_temperatures: carnot's_theorem states that all_reversible_engines operating between the_same_heat_reservoirs are equally efficient.
thus, a_heat_engine operating between t1 and t3 must have the_same_efficiency as one consisting of two_cycles, one between t1 and t2, and the second between t2 and t3.
this can only be the_case if
q             13 =
3 ,     {\displaystyle q_{13}={\frac {q_{1}q_{2}}{q_{2}q_{3}}},}   which implies           q
(_______________t
, t                 3           )
(_______________t                 1
,               t                 2           )
(_______________t_________________2_____________,_______________t
3           )         .
\displaystyle_q_{13}=f\left(t_{1},t_{3}\right)=f\left(t_{1},t_{2}\right)f\left(t_{2},t_{3}\right).}
since the_first_function is independent of t2, this_temperature must cancel on the_right_side, meaning f(t1, t3)
is of the_form
g(t1)/g(t3) (i.e. f(t1, t3) =
t2)f(t2,_t3) =
g(t1)/g(t2
) · g(t2)/g(t3) =_g(t1)/g(t3) ), where g is a_function of a_single_temperature.
a_temperature_scale can now be chosen with the_property that substituting (6) back into (4) gives a_relationship for the_efficiency in terms of temperature:
for tc = 0 k the_efficiency is 100% and that_efficiency becomes greater than 100% below 0 k.
since an_efficiency greater than 100% violates the_first_law of thermodynamics, this implies that 0
k is the_minimum_possible_temperature.
in fact the_lowest_temperature ever obtained in a_macroscopic_system was 20 nk, which was achieved in 1995 at nist.
subtracting the_right_hand_side of (5) from the_middle_portion and rearranging gives
q                 h_t_h         −
q_________________c_t_________________c =
0 ,     {\displaystyle {\frac {q_{\text{h}}}{t_{\text{h}}}}-{\frac_{q_{\text{c}}}{t_{\text{c}}}}=0,}   where the_negative_sign indicates heat ejected from the_system.
this_relationship suggests the_existence of a_state_function, s, defined by
where the_subscript indicates a_reversible_process.
the_change of this_state_function around any_cycle is zero, as is necessary for any_state_function.
this_state_function corresponds to the_entropy of the_system, which was described previously.
rearranging (8) gives a_formula for temperature in terms of fictive_infinitesimal_quasi-reversible_elements of entropy and heat:
for a_system, where entropy s(e) is a_function of entropy s(e) energy_e, the_temperature_t is given by
i.e. the reciprocal of the_temperature is the_rate of increase of entropy with respect to energy.
definition from statistical_mechanics ===
statistical_mechanics defines temperature based on a_system's_fundamental_degrees of freedom.
eq.(10) is the_defining_relation of temperature, where the_entropy
{\displaystyle s}    is defined (up to a constant) by the_logarithm of the_number of microstates of the_system in the_given_macrostate (as specified in the_microcanonical_ensemble)
:_s         =
k_______________b_ln
n )     {\displaystyle s=k_{\mathrm {b} }\ln(n)} where k
b     {\displaystyle_k_{\mathrm {b} }}    is boltzmann's constant and
n is the_number of microstates.
when two_systems with different_temperatures are put into purely_thermal_connection, heat will flow from the_higher_temperature_system to the_lower_temperature one; thermodynamically this is understood by the_second_law of thermodynamics: the total change in entropy following a_transfer of energy

generalized_temperature from single-particle_statistics ==
it is possible to extend the_definition of temperature even to systems of few_particles, like in a_quantum_dot.
the_generalized_temperature is obtained by considering time_ensembles instead of configuration-space_ensembles given in statistical_mechanics in the_case of thermal_and_particle_exchange between a_small_system of fermions
(n even less than 10) with a_single/double-occupancy_system.
the_finite_quantum_grand_canonical_ensemble, obtained under the_hypothesis of ergodicity and orthodicity, allows expressing the_generalized_temperature from the_ratio of the_average_time of occupation            τ             1
{\displaystyle_\tau _{1}}    and            τ             2     {\displaystyle_\tau _{2}}
of the_single/double-occupancy_system:
t         =
e___________________f (                   1
3                         2 n                 )
(                   2
τ                           2                         τ                           1 )
,     {\displaystyle t={\frac {e-e_{\text{f}}\left(1+{\frac {3}{2n}}\right)}{k_{\text{b}}\ln_\left(2{\frac {\tau _{
2}}{\tau__{1}}}\right)}},}   where ef is the_fermi_energy.
this_generalized_temperature tends to the_ordinary_temperature when n goes to infinity.
negative_temperature ==
on the_empirical_temperature_scales that are not referenced to absolute zero, a_negative_temperature is one below the_zero-point of the_scale used.
for example, dry_ice has a_sublimation_temperature of −78.5_°c which is equivalent to −109.3 °f.
on the_absolute_kelvin_scale this_temperature is 194.6_k.
no_body can be brought to exactly_0_k (the_temperature of the_ideally_coldest_possible_body) by any_finite_practicable_process; this is a_consequence of the_third_law of thermodynamics.
the_international_kinetic_theory_temperature of a_body cannot take negative_values.
the_thermodynamic_temperature_scale, however, is not so constrained.
for a_body of matter, there can sometimes be conceptually defined, in terms of microscopic_degrees of freedom, namely_particle_spins, a_subsystem, with a_temperature other than that of the_whole_body.
when the_whole_body is in the_whole_body own_state of internal_thermodynamic_equilibrium, the_temperatures of the_whole_body and of the_subsystem must be the same.
the_two_temperatures can differ when, by work through externally_imposed_force_fields, energy can be transferred to and from the_subsystem, separately from the_rest of the_body; then the_body is not in the_body own_state of internal_thermodynamic_equilibrium.
there is an_upper_limit of energy such_a_spin_subsystem can attain.
considering the_subsystem to be in a_temporary_state of virtual_thermodynamic_equilibrium, the_subsystem is possible to obtain a_negative_temperature on the_thermodynamic_scale.
thermodynamic_temperature is the_inverse of the_derivative of the_subsystem's_entropy with respect to its_internal_energy.
as the_subsystem's_internal_energy_increases, the_entropy increases for some_range, but eventually attains a_maximum_value and then begins to decrease as the_highest_energy_states begin to fill.
at the_point of maximum_entropy, the_temperature_function shows the_behavior of a_singularity, because the_slope of the_entropy_function decreases to zero and then turns negative.
as the_subsystem's_entropy reaches its_maximum, its_thermodynamic_temperature goes to positive_infinity, switching to negative_infinity as the_slope turns negative.
such_negative_temperatures are hotter than any_positive_temperature.
over time, when the_subsystem is exposed to the_rest of the_body, which has a_positive_temperature, energy is transferred as heat from the_subsystem to the_positive_temperature_system.
the_kinetic_theory_temperature is not defined for such_subsystems.

the_northrop_grumman_rq-180 is an_american_stealth_unmanned_aerial_vehicle (uav)_surveillance_aircraft intended for contested_airspace.
as of 2019, there had been no_images or statements released, but growing_evidence_points to the_existence of the_northrop_grumman_rq-180 and the_northrop_grumman_rq-180 use in regular_front-line_service.
edwards_air_force_base_personnel have reportedly nicknamed the northrop grumman rq-180 the_"great_white_bat" and "shikaka".
development ==
after the_retirement of the_sr-71_blackbird in 1999, the_us_air_force lacked an_intelligence_platform capable of penetrating airspace guarded by advanced_air_defense_systems.
the_rq-180 was designed to fulfill the_mission previously accomplished by the high-speed sr-71.the_rq-180
appears to be a_follow-on to the_joint_unmanned_combat_air_systems_project which was cancelled in late 2005 when the_united_states_navy (usn) wanted a_carrier-based_aircraft (which led to the_ucas-d) while the_united_states_air_force (usaf) wanted a_larger,_long-range_global_strike_platform.
in december 2005, the_program was split in two, with the_usn starting the_ucas-d_program which created the_northrop_grumman_x-47b, and the_usaf starting a_"classified_program.
the_program was unmasked in aviation_week & space_technology in a_december_9,_2013_cover_story following several_months of research.
the_rq-180 was secretly funded through the_usaf's_classified_budget.
northrop_grumman was given the_task to build the_aircraft after a_competition in which northrop_grumman defeated boeing and lockheed_martin.
northrop_grumman is believed to have been awarded a_development_contract for the_rq-180 in 2008, with deliveries of low-rate_production_aircraft beginning in 2013.
satellite_imagery of area 51 reportedly shows large_hangars that could house the_130_ft (40_m) or larger_wingspan of the_aircraft.
the rq-180 may also be related to the_expansion of northrop_grumman's_production_facility at united_states_air_force_plant 42 in palmdale, california.
according to aviation_week, the_secret_development of the_rq-180 explains public_statements of usaf_officials calling for penetrating intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (isr) capabilities with no_public_acknowledgement of an_effort to create one.
it may explain the_service's_lack of commitment for the_rq-4_global_hawk and instead favoring of higher_priority_"classified_platforms".
the_usaf also does not want to buy and maintain large_numbers of mq-1_predator_and_mq-9_reaper_systems in order to have an_aircraft that would have the_ability to penetrate denied_airspace and persistently provide isr_coverage.
the_rq-180 may also be responsible for the_termination of the_next-generation_bomber_program in 2009 from costs, and the_emergence of the_follow-on_long_range_strike_bomber (lrs-b)_program that would be cheaper and work with the_uav.
the_usaf_mq-x_program that was to find a_platform to replace the_reaper may have been cancelled in 2012 because of the_rq-180.creation of the_rq-180 is believed to be related to the_lrs-b_program, which will have a_new_strategic_bomber operate with a_"family of systems" including a_long_range_stand_off_weapon, conventional_prompt_global_strike_missiles, and electronic_attack and isr_platforms; the_rq-180 would appear to fill the electronic_attack and isr_roles.
on october 27, 2015, the_lrs-b_development_contract was also awarded to northrop_grumman.
lockheed_martin is developing lockheed_own_solution to the_problem of operating an_isr in defended_airspace, known as the sr-72, that relies on flying at hypersonic_speeds.
northrop_grumman's_stealth_design was seen as less susceptible to acquisition_problems and risky_technologies and could be put into service sooner, as soon as 2015.
a_hypersonic_reconnaissance_aircraft would have inferior_stealth_features due to_heat stress on radar_absorbent_materials and would thus be detected earlier.
moving_targets could change position before the sr-72 could reach them.
the_existence of a_hypersonic_reconnaissance_aircraft was confirmed with the briefest of details by an_air_force_surveillance_chief during an_aerospace_industry_event in 2014.in_november 2020
the_first_photograph emerged of the rq-180.
the_aircraft was spotted flying at high_altitude over edwards_air_force_base.
the_rq-180 addresses a_need for conducting penetrating isr_missions into defended_airspace, a_mission that was left unattended with the_retirement of the_lockheed_sr-71_blackbird in 1999.
the rq-180 is equipped with an_aesa_radar and passive_electronic_surveillance_measures, and may be capable of conducting electronic_attack_missions.
the_rq-180 shows a_shift from uavs that operate in permissive_environments, such as the_rq-4_global_hawk and mq-9_reaper, to ones that can perform missions in contested_airspace.
it is larger, stealthier, and has a_longer_range than the_rq-170_sentinel which has previously been used for those_types of missions.
the_rq-180 is believed to be about the_size of the_global_hawk, which weighs 32,250 lb (14,630_kg), and have similar_capabilities of endurance (24_hours) and range (12,000_nmi (14,000_mi; 22,000_km)).
this is much more than the_rq-170's_endurance of 5–6_hours.
this has superior all-aspect, broadband radar cross-section reduction features compared to previous_stealth_aircraft such as the_f-117_nighthawk, f-22_raptor and f-35_lightning_ii.
the_airframe has superior_aerodynamics to give better_range, endurance, and service_ceiling.
the_rq-180 is believed to have a_cranked-kite_layout like the_x-47b, but with a_much_longer_wingspan, perhaps as_much_as_130_ft (40_m).
northrop_grumman claims the_wing is more scalable and adaptable than the_b-2_spirit's_flying_wing_shape.
aviation week constructed concept_images, including one on the_cover of the_magazine, of the_stealthy_unmanned_aircraft that can penetrate an adversary's state-of-the-art air defenses to conduct intelligence, surveillance or reconnaissance_missions.

aviation_week_release_aviation_week's_"the_road to stealth_uas" on the_morning of 7_april 2017, the_united_states launched 59_tomahawk_cruise_missiles from the_mediterranean_sea into syria, aimed at shayrat_airbase controlled by the syrian government.
the_strike was executed under responsibility of u.s._president_donald_trump, as a_direct_response to the_khan_shaykhun_chemical_attack that occurred on 4_april.
the_strike was the_first_unilateral_military_action by the_united_states targeting the_syrian_government during the_syrian_civil_war.
u.s._president_donald_trump stated shortly thereafter, "it is in this_vital_national_security_interest of the_united_states to prevent and deter the_spread and use of deadly_chemical_weapons. "
the_syrian_air_force launched airstrikes against the_rebels from the_base only hours after the_khan_shaykhun_chemical_attack that occurred on 4_april.
it was reported that advance_warning was given to russia, an_ally of the_syrian_government, by the_usa prior to the_missile_strike.
on the_evening of 6_april, president_trump notified members of the_u.s._congress of president_trump plan on the_missile_strike.
according to a_white_house_official, more_than_two_dozen_members of the_u.s.
congress were briefed at the_notification.
internationally, the_united_states also notified several_countries, including canada, the_uk, australia, and russia, in advance of the_strike.
the_u.s._military stated the_u.s._military communicated with the_russian_military to minimize any_chance of russian_casualties.
the_strike was conducted without either_u.s._congressional_or_united_nations_security_council_approval.
commodore_tate_westbrook commanded the_navy_task_force in charge of the_missile_launch.
it was the_first_time that the_united_states had acknowledged intentionally carrying out military_action against the_forces of syrian_president_bashar_al-assad.
the_strike targeted shayrat_airbase in the_homs_governorate, which was believed by american_intelligence to be the_base for the_aircraft that carried out a_chemical_weapons_attack on 4_april, and was intended to destroy air_defenses, aircraft, hangars and fuel.
the_us avoided striking a_suspected_sarin_gas_storage_facility at the_targeted_airport.
59_tomahawk_missiles were said to have been launched from two_u.s._navy_warships, uss_ross and uss_porter, at around 20:40_edt (04:40_local_time).
reconnaissance was provided by python 73, a_boeing_rc-135 of the_55th_wing.
casualties ==
u.s._central_command stated in a_press_release that tomahawk_missiles hit "aircraft, hardened_aircraft_shelters, petroleum and logistical_storage, ammunition_supply_bunkers, defense_systems, and radars".
initial_u.s._reports claimed "approximately_20_planes" were destroyed, and that 58 out of the_59_cruise_missiles launched "severely degraded or destroyed" their_intended_target.
according to the_satellite_images the_runways and the_taxiways have been reportedly_undamaged_and_combat_flights from the_attacked_airbase resumed on 7_april a few hours after the_attack, although u.s._officials did not state that the_runway was a_target.
in a_later_statement on 10_april 2017, the us secretary of defense james mattis claimed that the_strike destroyed about_20% of the_syrian_government's_operational_aircraft and the_base had lost the_ability to refuel or rearm aircraft.
an_independent_bomb_damage_assessment conducted by imagesat_international counted hits on 44_targets, with some_targets being hit by more_than_one_missile; these_figures were determined using satellite_images of the_airbase 10 hours after the_strike.
among the_targets struck was a_2k12_kub_(sa6)_missile_battery composed of five_elements.
the_syrian_observatory for human_rights said the_strike damaged over_a_dozen_hangars, a_fuel_depot, and an_air_defense_base.
al-masdar_news reported that 15_fighter_jets were damaged or destroyed and that the_destruction of fuel_tankers caused several_explosions and a_large_fire.
according to the_claims of russian_defense_ministry, the_"combat_effectiveness" of the_attack was "extremely low"; the_"combat_effectiveness" of the_attack claimed that only_23_missiles hit the_base destroying six_aircraft, and the_attack did not know where the other 36 landed.
russian_television_news, citing a_syrian_source at the_airfield, said that nine_planes were destroyed by the_strikes (5_su-22m3s, 1_su-22m4, and 3
and that all_planes were thought to have been out of action at the_time.
the_israeli_satellite_imagery_services_company imagesat_international later released high_resolution_satellite_images of the_base taken within 10_hours of the_attack showing that at a_minimum, 44_targets had been hit, and that some had been hit multiple times.
lost_armour's_online_photographic_database, for vehicle_losses in the_war in syria, has images of 10_destroyed_aircraft at shayrat_airbase.
seven_or_nine_syrian_soldiers were killed, including a general; russian_military_personnel were also present at the_airbase at the_time the_airbase was attacked.
according to syrian_state_news sana, nine_civilians were also killed in the_attack, including four_children.
sana also stated that five_of_nine_civilians were killed in the_village of shayrat, outside the_base, while another four were killed in the_village of al-hamrat, and that another_seven_civilians were wounded when a_missile hit homes in al-manzul, four_kilometers (two_and_a_half_miles) away from the_base.
according to russian_defense_ministry_spokesperson_igor_konashenkov, four_syrian_soldiers were killed and another two were missing.
some_observers believe that the_russian_government warned the_syrian_government, which had enough_time to move planes to another_base.
aftermath ==
hours after the_u.s._missile_strike, syrian_government's_warplanes took off from another_base to attack rebel_positions again, including the_town of khan_shaykhun.
commentators attributed the_ability of syrian_government to continue to operate from another_base to the_fact that the_us gave russia, syria's_ally, an_advanced_warning regarding the_strike, which enabled syrians to shelter many of its_aircraft from the_attack.
within a_day of the_attack, russia announced russia would strengthen syria's_air_defenses and formally notified the_pentagon that as of 21:00_gmt (00:00_moscow_time, 8_april 2017), russia had suspended the u.s.–russia memorandum of mutual_understanding, which had established a_hotline between the_countries′_militaries designed to avoid collisions between their_aircraft over syria.
as a_result, belgium suspended belgium air operations in syria, and the_us began limiting belgium to only_the_most_essential_air_strikes.
according to some_local_sources, the_islamic_state of iraq and the_levant took advantage of the_attack and absence of the_syrian_air_force in eastern_homs, by launching several_attacks on the_syrian_army's_defenses in the_western_palmyra_countryside.
the_syrian_army's_defenses in the_western_palmyra_countryside also attacked the_checkpoints outside the_village of al-furqalas, but several_attacks on the_syrian_army's_defenses in the_western_palmyra_countryside were repelled.
according to the_syrian_observatory for human_rights, the_shayrat_airbase remained operational and syrian_warplanes took off from the_shayrat_airbase the following day.
the_price of oil briefly rose over 2% following the_strike.
after both_the_chemical_attack_and_missile_strike, the_u.s._administration was in disagreement and contradiction to u.s._policy from 2013 until 30_march 2017, as well the_statements by u.s._ambassador to u.n._nikki_haley, united states secretary of state rex tillerson, white_house_press_secretary_sean_spicer and national_security_advisor_h._r._mcmaster differed on the_change of u.s._military_posture toward syria and prioritization of regime_change.
on 7_april 2017, an_emergency_meeting of the_united_nations_security_council was held: bolivia′s
ambassador_sacha_llorenty requested a_closed_session to discuss the_strikeu.s. , but u.s._ambassador_nikki_haley, serving as the_council_president for april, forced an_emergency_meeting of the_united_nations_security_council to be held in public_view.
united_nations_news_centre reported that while some_delegates expressed support for the_strikes as a_response to the_syrian_government's_alleged_use of chemical_weapons, others condemned the_strikes as a_unilateral_act of aggression, underlining that the_united_nations_security_council must authorize any_such_intervention.
on 8_april 2017, the_uk_foreign_secretary_boris_johnson issued a_statement that announced that, upon consultations with the u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson, the_uk_foreign_secretary_boris_johnson had cancelled the_uk_foreign_secretary_boris_johnson trip to moscow scheduled for 10_april.
on 11_april 2017, after the_meeting at lucca in italy the_group of seven unanimously blamed the_syrian_government's_military for the_chemical_attack and agreed that assad must step down as part of any_peace_solution, but european_allies rejected the_us and uk push for sanctions against russia and syria.
on 19_april 2017, two_us_defense_officials said that the_syrian_government had relocated the_majority of the_syrian_government combat planes to khmeimim_airbase shortly after the_strike.
in september 2020, u.s._president_trump mentioned that u.s._president_trump wanted to kill al-assad in 2017, by saying: "i would have rather taken al-assad out.
i had al-assad all set, mattis didn't want to do it."
reactions == ===
united_states === ====
politicians ====
reactions from members of congress were mixed and not uniform by political_party.
paul_ryan (r–wi), the_speaker of the_united_states_house of representatives, said the_strike was "appropriate and just".
house_majority_leader_kevin_mccarthy (r–ca) said, "assad has made assad disregard for innocent_human_life and long-standing_norms against chemical_weapons use crystal clear.
tonight's_strikes show these_evil_actions carry consequences."
house_minority_leader_nancy_pelosi (d–ca) said, "tonight's_strike in syria appears to be a_proportional_response to the_regime's_use of chemical_weapons."
senate_majority_leader_mitch_mcconnell (r–ky) said tonight's_strike in syria was "perfectly executed and for the_right_purpose".
senate_minority_leader_chuck_schumer (d–ny) said, "making sure assad knows that when assad commits such_despicable_atrocities assad will pay a_price is the_right_thing to do."
senator_bill_nelson (d–fl) expressed senator_bill_nelson (d–fl) support, and said, "i hope this teaches assad not to use chemical_weapons again."
senator_marco_rubio (r–fl) called it an "important decisive step".
quoting the_president's_statement, senator_orrin_hatch (r–ut) tweeted, "'no_child of god should ever suffer such_horror.'
in a_joint_statement, senators_john_mccain (r–az) and lindsey_graham (r–sc) said, "unlike the_previous_administration, president_trump confronted a_pivotal_moment in syria and took action.
for that, president_trump deserves the_support of the_american_people.
" their_sentiment was shared by fellow_senators bob_corker (r–tn), tom cotton (r–ar), joni_ernst (r–ia), cory_gardner (r–co), david_perdue (r–ga), ben_sasse (r–ne), and thom_tillis (r–nc).
many_members who supported the_action showed lack of worry about the_authority_issues or did not know the_legal_and_constitutional_rationale that supported the_action.
other_lawmakers criticized the_president's_actions, or urged caution.
representative_adam_schiff (d–ca), the_ranking_member of the_house_intelligence_committee, was informed of the_strike by dan_coats, the_director of national_intelligence, as it was happening.
he urged the_administration "not to make this a military effort to change the_regime".
in a_joint_statement, representatives_and_iraq_war_veterans seth_moulton (d–ma) and steve_russell (r–ok) said, "representatives_and_iraq_war_veterans seth_moulton (d–ma) and steve_russell (r– cannot stand by in silence as dictators murder children with chemical_weapons, but military_action without clear_goals and objectives gets us nowhere."
senator_chris_coons (d–de) said senator_chris_coons (d–de) was "gravely concerned that the_united_states is engaging further militarily in syria without a well-thought-out, comprehensive plan".
representative_ted_lieu (d–ca) and senator_tim_kaine (d–va) called the_strike unconstitutional, with the_former_tweeting, "this was done with no_debate in congress and no_explanation to the_american_people."
senator_bernie_sanders (i-vt) tweeted that the_strike could lead the_u.s. into a_new_long-term_quagmire, and that "such_engagements are disastrous for american_security, for the_american_economy, and for the_american_people".
representative_tulsi_gabbard (d–hi) gave a_more_critical_message, and said, "this_escalation is short-sighted and will lead to the_death of more_civilians, more_refugees, the_strengthening of al-qaeda and other_terrorists, and a_possible_nuclear_war between the_united_states and russia."
other_lawmakers expressing criticism included senators_michael_bennet (d–co), ben_cardin (d–md), ted_cruz (r–tx), dick_durbin (d–il), ed_markey (d–ma), jeff_merkley (d–or), elizabeth_warren (d–ma), and representatives_joaquín_castro (d–tx) and steny_hoyer (d–md).a number of republicans with libertarian_leanings also criticized the_strike.
senator_mike_lee (r–ut) said, "president_trump should make president_trump case in front of the_american_people and allow the_american_people elected representatives to debate the_benefits and risks of further_middle_east_intervention to our_national_security_interests."
senator_rand_paul (r–ky) tweeted, "while we all condemn the_atrocities in syria, the_united_states was not attacked."
representatives_justin_amash (r–mi) said, "airstrikes are an_act of war.
atrocities in syria cannot justify a_departure from constitution, which vests in congress the_power to commence war", and thomas_massie (r–ky) called it a "big mistake".
former_congressman_ron_paul argued that because in syria "things [had been] going along reasonably well for the_conditions", there was "zero_chance" that assad had deliberately used chemical_weapons, and called the_attack a "false flag".
public ====
u.s._media_outlets such as the_new_york_times, washington_post, msnbc and cnn were all generally supportive of the_administration's_decision to use airstrikes against syria.
a_poll conducted by the_washington_post and abc_news reported that a_"bare_majority" of americans supported the_missile_strikes and a_similarly_narrow_majority opposed any_further_military_action against the_syrian_government.
a_poll conducted by the_washington_post and yougov reported that around_51% of americans supported the_decision, and slightly_more_than_one-third opposed both the_decision and any_further_military_action, with 45% unsure regarding future_action.
a_poll conducted by abc_news reported that a_small_majority (nearly 6/10) supported the_attack, but the_appearance of consensus ends regarding future_action.
a_poll conducted by politico and morning_consult reported that 66% supported the_strikes, which includes 35% who strongly support and 31% who somewhat support them.
many_right-wing/-leaning_populist_media_figures criticized trump's_reversal of policy towards war in syria and the_middle_east.
ann_coulter pointed out that trump "campaigned on not getting involved in mideast" and this was one of the_reasons many voted for  ann_coulter.
several_protests were held in the_u.s. which demonstrated against the_attack.
syria and allies ===
a_joint_command_center of russian_and_iranian_military in syria, who support the syrian government, said the_strike crossed "red_lines" and threatened to "respond with force" to "us_aggression".
syria ====
syrian_state_media condemned the_strike, calling the_strike an "act of aggression", and claiming the_strike caused unspecified_losses.
the_syrian_army said that the_syrian_army response will be to continue to_"crush_terrorism" and restore "peace and security to all_syrians".
the_governor of homs, talal_barazi, said that the_strike proves that the_united_states is supporting terrorism within syria.
barazi told the_syrian_news_channel that "they are not surprised today to see the_supporting_parties interfering directly after the_failure of terrorists in targeting syria".
the_spokesperson for syrian_president_bashar_al-assad called the missile strikes "unjust and arrogant aggression", and an_"outrageous_act", and that the_attack "does not change the_deep_policies" of the_syrian_government.
the_syrian_ambassador bashar_jaafari at the_un_security_council_session stated that "this_act makes america a partner of isil, al-nusra and other terrorist groups", and this_act was a_violation of the_u.n._charter.
syrian_president_bashar_al-assad later told the_agence_france-presse that the_attack was "100% fabricated" and accused the_united_states of being "hand-in-glove with the_terrorists" over the_attack.
syrian_president_bashar_al-assad also explained that the_attack was made up in order to give the_united_states an_excuse to bomb the_shayrat_airbase in retaliation.
najib_ghadbian, a_representative of the_national_coalition for syrian_revolutionary_and_opposition_forces, welcomed the_strikes
: "they are first_good_steps
but we would like they to be part of a_bigger_strategy that would put an_end to the_mass_killing, an_end to impunity and eventually we hope that they will lead to a_kind of a_political_transition [in syria].
the_pro-turkish_kurdish_national_council welcomed the_missile_strikes in syria. "
all_syrian_people, including the_kurds, are happy and welcoming such_an_air_campaign by the_united_states", a_leader in the_kurdish_unity_party, part of the_knc, stated.
salih_muslim_muhammad, co-leader of the_democratic_union_party, stated that the_attack "must yield positive_results since the_parties who did not believe in a_political_solution" will "reconsider" and "see that there is no_military_solution", and the_us was "forced" to execute the_attack.
the_pyd "hoped" that the_us will not only attack the_syrian_government, but "other_parties have also used the_us will not only attack the_syrian_government, in sheikh_maqsood, in rojava, and raqqa".
russia ====
the_russian_president′s_spokesperson said the_u.s._strike was "an_act of aggression against a_sovereign_country violating the_norms of international_law under a_trumped-up_pretext", which "substantially impair[ed]" russia–united_states_relations.
the_russian_government also alleged that the_u.s._strike was an_attempt to distract the_world from civilian_casualties in iraq (an_apparent_reference to u.s._airstrike in mosul that killed more than 200).
the_russian_foreign_ministry denounced the_u.s._strike as being based on false_intelligence and against international_law, suspended the_memorandum of understanding (mou) on prevention of flight_safety_incidents that had been signed with u.s., and called an_emergency_meeting of the_united_nations_security_council.
russian_foreign_minister_sergey_lavrov compared the_u.s.
strikeiraq.
russian_prime_minister_dimitry_medvedev said the_attack had placed u.s. on the_cusp of warfare with russia.
russia has sent the_frigate admiral_grigorovich to the_east_mediterranean in response, and warned that the_us_strike could have "extremely_serious"_consequences.
iran's_president hassan_rouhani condemned the_us_strike, saying trump had claimed that "trump wanted to fight terrorism, but today, all_terrorists in syria are celebrating the_u.s._attack".
according to iranian_foreign_minister_mohammad_javad_zarif's_tweet, "not_even_two_decades after 9/11,_u.s._military_fighting on same_side as al-qaida & isis in yemen & syria.
time to stop hype and cover-ups."
he described u.s._concerns regarding chemical_attacks as hypocritical, inasmuch as the_united_states had supported iraqi_forces under saddam_hussein as iraqi_forces under saddam_hussein massively used chemical_weapons during the_iran–iraq_war.
during friday_prayers in tehran, worshipers protesting the_strike chanted "death to america" and "death to al_saud" – referring to the_saudi_royal_family.
ayatollah_mohammad_emami_kashani, who led the_friday_prayers, called the united states "crazy" and blasted the_united_states_"crimes".
ayatollah_kashani said that the_americans "gave chemical_weapons and substances to the_terrorists, while creating terrorists all over the_world".
according to an_analyst writing for huffpost, the_2017_deir_ez-zor_missile_strike by iran suggests that the_country has shifted the_country three_decades-long_policy of testing, but not using missiles, as a_reaction to donald_trump's_escalation in the_middle_east, including "needless_increase" in america's_military_involvement in the_syrian_proxy_war.

the_iowa_class was a_class of six_fast_battleships ordered by the_united_states_navy in 1939 and 1940.
the_iowa_class were initially intended to intercept fast_capital_ships such as the_japanese_kongō_class while also being capable of serving in a_traditional_battle_line alongside slower_battleships and act as its_"fast_wing".
the_iowa_class was designed to meet the_second_london_naval_treaty's_"escalator_clause"_limit of 45,000-long-ton (45,700_t) standard displacement.
four_vessels, iowa, new_jersey, missouri, and wisconsin, were completed; two more, illinois and kentucky, were laid down but canceled in 1945 and 1958, respectively, before completion, and both_hulls were scrapped in 1958–1959.
the_four_iowa-class_ships were the_last_battleships commissioned in the_us_navy.
all_older_us_battleships were decommissioned by 1947 and stricken from the_naval_vessel_register (nvr) by 1963.
between the_mid-1940s and the_early_1990s, the_iowa-class_battleships fought in four_major_us_wars.
in the_pacific_theater of world_war_ii, the_iowa-class_battleships served primarily as fast_escorts for essex-class_aircraft_carriers of the_fast_carrier_task_force and also shelled japanese_positions.
during the_korean_war, the_battleships provided naval_gunfire_support (ngfs) for united_nations_forces, and in 1968, new_jersey shelled viet_cong and vietnam_people's_army_forces in the_korean_war.
all four were reactivated and modernized at the_direction of the_united_states_congress in 1981, and armed with missiles during the_1980s, as part of the_600-ship_navy_initiative.
during operation_desert_storm in 1991, missouri and wisconsin fired missiles and 16-inch (406_mm) guns at iraqi_targets.
costly to maintain, the_battleships were decommissioned during the_post-cold_war draw down in the_early_1990s.
all four were initially removed from the_naval_vessel_register, but the_united_states_congress compelled the_navy to reinstate two of the_united_states_congress on the_grounds that existing_ngfs would be inadequate for amphibious_operations.
this resulted in a_lengthy_debate over whether battleships should have a_role in the_modern_navy.
ultimately, all_four_ships were stricken from the_naval_vessel_register and released for donation to non-profit_organizations.
with the_transfer of iowa in 2012, all four are part of non-profit_maritime_museums across the_us.
background ==
the_vessels that eventually became the_iowa-class_battleships were born from the_us_navy's_war_plan_orange, a_pacific_war_plan against japan.
war_planners anticipated that the_us_fleet would engage and advance in the_central_pacific, with a_long_line of communication and logistics that would be vulnerable to high-speed_japanese_cruisers.
the_chief_concern was that the_us_navy's_traditional_21-knot_battle_line would be too slow to force these_japanese_task_forces into battle, while faster_carriers and these_japanese_task_forces cruiser escorts would be outmatched by the_japanese_kongō-class_battlecruisers, which had been upgraded in the_1930s to fast_battleships.
as a_result, the_us_navy envisioned a_fast_detachment of the_battle_line that could bring the_japanese_fleet into battle.
even during the_development_process of the_preceding_north_carolina-class_and_south_dakota-class_battleships, designs that could achieve over_30_knots in order to counter the_threat of fast_"big_gun"_ships were seriously considered.
at the_same_time, a_special_strike_force consisting of fast_battleships operating alongside carriers and destroyers was being envisaged; such_a_force could operate independently in advance_areas and act as scouts.
this_concept eventually evolved into the_fast_carrier_task_force, though initially the_carriers were believed to be subordinate to the_battleship.
another_factor was the_"escalator_clause" of the_second_london_naval_treaty, which reverted the_gun_caliber_limit from 14_inches (356_mm) to 16_inches (406_mm).
japan had refused to sign the_second_london_naval_treaty and in particular refused to accept the_14-inch_gun_caliber_limit or the_5:5:3_ratio of warship_tonnage_limits for britain, united_states, and japan respectively.
this resulted in the_three_treaty_powers, the_united_states, britain, and france, invoking the_escalator_clause after april 1937.
circulation of intelligence_evidence in november 1937 of japanese_capital_ships violating naval_treaties caused the_treaty_powers to expand the_escalator_clause in june 1938, which amended the_standard_displacement_limit of battleships from 35,000_long_tons (35,600_t) to 45,000_long_tons (45,700_t).
design == ===
early_studies ===
work on what would eventually become the_iowa-class_battleship began on the_first_studies in early 1938, at the_direction of admiral_thomas_c._hart, head of the_general_board, following the_planned_invocation of the_"escalator_clause" that would permit maximum_standard_capital_ship_displacement of 45,000_long_tons (45,700_t).
using the_additional_10,000_long_tons (10,200_t) over previous_designs, the_studies included schemes for 27-knot (50_km/h; 31 mph)
"slow"_battleships that increased armament and protection as well as "fast"_battleships capable of 33_knots (61_km/h; 38_mph) or more.
one of the_"slow"_designs was an_expanded_south_dakota-class carrying either_twelve_16-inch/45_caliber_mark_6_guns or nine_18-inch_(457_mm)/48_guns and with more_armor and a_power_plant large enough to drive the_larger_ship through the_water at the_same_27-knot_maximum_speed as the_south_dakotas.
while the_"fast"_studies would result in the_iowa_class, the_"slow"_design_studies would eventually settle on twelve_16-inch_guns and evolve into the_design for the_60,500-long-ton (61,500_t)
montana_class after all_treaty_restrictions were removed following the_start of world_war_ii.
priority was given to the_"fast"_design in order to counter and defeat japan's_26_knot (actually_30_knot)
kongō-class_battlecruisers, whose_higher_speed_advantage over existing_u.s._battleships might let them "penetrate u.s._cruisers, thereby making it 'open season' on u.s._supply_ships",
and then overwhelm the_japanese_battle_line
was therefore a_major_driving_force in setting the_design_criteria for the_new_ships, as was the_restricting_width of the_panama_canal.
for "fast"_battleships, one_such_design, pursued by the_design_division_section of the_bureau of construction and repair, was a_"cruiser-killer".
beginning on 17_january 1938, under captain_a.j._chantry, the_group drew up plans for ships with twelve 16-inch and twenty 5-inch (127_mm) guns, panamax_capability but otherwise_unlimited_displacement,
a_top_speed of 35_knots (65_km/h; 40_mph) and a_range of 20,000_nautical_miles (37,000_km; 23,000_mi)
when traveling at the_more_economical_speed of 15_knots (28_km/h; 17 mph).
their_plan fulfilled these_requirements with a_ship of chantry, but chantry believed that more could be done if a_ship of 50,940_long_tons (51,760_t) standard displacement were to be this large; with a_displacement greater than that of most_battleships, a_ship of 50,940_long_tons (51,760_t) standard_displacement_armor would have protected a_ship of 50,940_long_tons (51,760_t) standard displacement only against the_8-inch_(200_mm) weapons carried by heavy_cruisers.
three_improved_plans – "a",_"b", and "c" – were designed at the_end of january.
an_increase in draft,_vast_additions to the_armor, and the_substitution of twelve 6-inch (152_mm) guns in the_secondary_battery was common among the_three_designs.
a" was the largest, at 59,060_long_tons (60,010_t) standard, and was the only one to still carry the_twelve_16-inch_guns in four_triple_turrets (3-gun_turrets according to us_navy).
it required 277,000_shp (207,000_kw) to make 32.5_knots (60.2_km/h; 37.4_mph).
b" was the smallest at 52,707_long_tons (53,553_t) standard; like "a
" it had a_top_speed of 32.5_knots, but
"b" only required 225,000_shp (168,000_kw) to make a_top_speed of 32.5_knots.
it also carried only_nine_16-inch_guns, in three_triple_turrets. "
c" was similar but  c added 75,000_shp (56,000_kw) (for a_total of 300,000_shp (220,000_kw)), to make the_original_requirement of 35_knots.
the_weight required for this and a_longer_belt – 512_feet (156_m), compared with 496_feet (151_m) for "b" – meant that the_ship was 55,771 long tons (56,666_t) standard.
design_history ==
in march 1938, the_general_board followed the_recommendations of the_battleship_design_advisory_board, which was composed of the_naval_architect william_francis_gibbs, william_hovgaard (then_president of new_york_shipbuilding), john_metten, joseph_w._powell, and the_long-retired_admiral and former_chief of the_bureau of ordnance joseph_strauss.
the_general_board requested an_entirely_new_design_study, again focusing on increasing the_size of the_35,000-long-ton_(36,000_t)
south_dakota-class.
the_first_plans made for this indicated that 30_knots (56_km/h; 35_mph) was possible on a_standard_displacement of about_37,600_long_tons (38,200_t).
33_knots (61_km/h; 38_mph) could be bought with 220,000_shp (160,000_kw) and a_standard_displacement of around_39,230_long_tons (39,860_t), which was well below the_london_treaty's_"escalator_clause" maximum_limit of 45,000_long_tons (45,700_t).these_designs were able to convince the_general_board that a_reasonably_well-designed_and_balanced_33-knot_"fast"_battleship was possible within the_terms of the_"escalator_clause".
however, further_studies revealed major_problems with the_estimates.
the_speed of the_ships meant that more_freeboard would be needed both fore and amidships, the latter requiring an_additional_foot of armored_freeboard.
along with this came the_associated_weight in supporting these_new_strains: the_structure of the_ship had to be reinforced and the_power_plant enlarged to avoid a_drop in speed.
in all, about_2,400_long_tons (2,440_t) had to be added, and the_large_margin the_navy_designers had previously thought the_navy_designers had – roughly_5,000_long_tons (5,080_t) – was suddenly vanishing.
the_draft of the_ships was also allowed to increase, which enabled the_beam to narrow and thus reduced required_power (since lower beam-to-draft ratio reduces wave-making_resistance).
this also allowed the_ships to be shortened which reduced weight.
with the_additional_displacement, the_general_board was incredulous that a_tonnage_increase of 10,000_long_tons (10,200_t) would allow only_the_addition of 6_knots (11_km/h; 6.9_mph) over the_south_dakotas.
rather than retaining the_16-inch/45_caliber_mark_6_guns used in the_south_dakotas, they ordered that the_preliminary_design would have to include the_more_powerful_but_significantly_heavier_16-inch/50_caliber_mark_2_guns left over from the_canceled_lexington-class_battlecruisers and south_dakota-class_battleships of the early 1920s.
the_16"/50_turret weighed some_400_long_tons (406_t) more than the_16"/45_turret already in use.
the_barbette_diameter had been increased from 37-foot-3-inch (11.4_m) to 39_feet 4_inches (12.0_m)
so the_total_weight_gain was about_2,000_long_tons (2,030_t), putting the_ship at a_total of 46,551_long_tons (47,298_t) – well over the_45,000_long_ton_limit.
an_apparent_savior appeared in a bureau of ordnance preliminary design for a_turret that could carry the_50-caliber_guns while also fit in the_smaller_barbette of the_45-caliber_gun_turret.
other_weight_savings were achieved through thinning some_armor_elements and substituting construction_steel with armor-grade_special_treatment_steel (sts) in certain_areas.
the_net_savings reduced the_preliminary_design_displacement to 44,560 long tons (45,280_t) standard, though the_margin remained tight.
this_breakthrough was shown to the_general_board as part of a_series of designs on 2 june 1938.however, the_bureau of ordnance continued working on the_turret with the_larger_barbette, while the_bureau of construction and repair used the_smaller_barbettes in the_contract_design of the_new_battleships.
as the_bureaus were independent of one another, the_bureaus did not realize that the_two_plans could not go together until november 1938, when the_contract_design was in the_final_stages of refinement.
by this_time, the_ships could not use the_larger_barbette, as it would require extensive_alterations to the_design and would result in substantial_weight_penalties.
the_general_board was astounded; one_member asked the_head of the_bureau of ordnance if the_head of the_bureau of ordnance had occurred to one_member that construction and repair would have wanted to know what_turret one_member subordinates were working on "as a_matter of common_sense".
a_complete_scrapping of plans was avoided only when designers within the_bureau of ordnance were able to design a_new_50-caliber_gun, the_mark 7, that was both lighter and smaller in outside_diameter; this allowed a_complete_scrapping of plans to be placed in a_turret that would fit in the_smaller_barbette.
the_redesigned_3-gun_turret, equipped as it was with the_mark_7_naval_gun, provided an_overall_weight_saving of nearly_850_long_tons (864_t) to the_overall_design of the_iowa_class.
the_contract_design_displacement subsequently stood at 45,155 long tons (45,880_t) standard and 56,088 long tons (56,988_t) full_load.
in may 1938, the_united_states_congress passed the_second_vinson_act which "mandated a_20%_increase in strength of the_united_states_navy".
the_second_vinson_act which "mandated a_20%_increase in strength of the_united_states_navy was sponsored by carl_vinson, a_democratic_congressman from georgia who was chairman of the_house_naval_affairs_and_armed_services_committee.
the_second_vinson_act which "mandated a_20%_increase in strength of the_united_states_navy updated the_provisions of the_vinson-trammell_act of 1934 and the_naval_act of 1936, which had "authorized the_construction of the_first_american_battleships in 17_years", based on the_provisions of the_london_naval_treaty of 1930; the_second_vinson_act which "mandated a_20%_increase in strength of the_united_states_navy was quickly signed by president_franklin_d._roosevelt and provided the_funding to build the_iowa_class.
each_ship cost approximately us$100 million.
as 1938 drew to a_close_the_contract_design of the_iowas was nearly complete, but the_iowas would continuously evolve as the_new_york_navy_yard, the_lead_shipyard, conducted the_final_detail_design.
these_revisions included changing the_design of the_foremast, replacing the original 1.1-inch (27.9_mm)/75-caliber_guns that were to be used for anti-aircraft (aa) work with 20_mm (0.79_in)/70_caliber_oerlikon_cannons and 40_mm (1.57_in)/56_caliber_bofors_guns, and moving the_combat_information_center into the_armored_hull.
additionally, in november 1939, the_new_york_navy_yard greatly modified the_internal_subdivision of the_machinery_rooms, as tests had shown the_underwater_protection in the_machinery_rooms to be inadequate.
the_longitudinal_subdivision of the_machinery_rooms was doubled, and the_result of this was clearly beneficial: "the_prospective_effect of flooding was roughly halved and the_number of uptakes and hence of openings in the_third_deck greatly reduced."
although the_changes meant extra_weight and increasing the_beam by 1_foot (0.30_m) to 108_feet 2_inches (32.97_m), this was no longer a_major_issue; britain and france had renounced the_second_london_naval_treaty soon after the_beginning of the_second_world_war.
the_design_displacement was 45,873 long tons (46,609_t) standard, approximately 2% overweight, when iowa and new_jersey were laid down in june and september 1940.
by the_time the_iowas were completed and commissioned in 1943–44, the_considerable_increase in anti-aircraft_armament – along with their_associated_splinter_protection_and_crew_accommodations – and additional_electronics had increased standard_displacement to some_47,825_long_tons (48,592_t), while full_load_displacement became 57,540_long_tons (58,460_t).
specifications == ===
general_characteristics ===
the_iowa-class_battleships are 860 ft 0 in (262.13_m) long at the_waterline and 887_ft 3 in (270.43_m)
long overall with beam of 108_ft 2 in (32.97_m).
during world_war_ii, the_draft was 37 ft 2 in (11.33_m) at full_load_displacement of 57,540_long_tons (58,460_t) and 34 ft 9 1⁄4 in (10.60_m) at design_combat_displacement of 54,889_long_tons (55,770_t).
like the_two_previous_classes of american_fast_battleships, the_iowas feature a_triple_bottom under the_armored_citadel and armored_skegs around the_inboard_shafts.
the_dimensions of the_iowas were strongly influenced by speed.
when the_second_vinson_act was passed by the_united_states_congress in 1938, the_us_navy moved quickly to develop a_45,000-ton-standard_battleship that would pass through the_110_ft (34_m) wide_panama_canal.
drawing on a_1935_empirical_formula for predicting a_ship's_maximum_speed based on scale-model_studies in flumes of various_hull_forms and propellers and a_newly_developed_empirical_theorem that related waterline_length to maximum_beam, the_us_navy drafted plans for a_battleship_class with a maximum_beam of 108_ft 2 in (32.97_m) which, when multiplied by 7.96, produced a waterline_length of 860_ft (262_m).
the_us_navy also called for the_class to have a_lengthened_forecastle and amidship, which would increase speed, and a_bulbous_bow.
the_iowas exhibit good_stability, making them steady gun platforms.
at design_combat_displacement, the ships' (gm) metacentric height was 9.26_ft (2.82_m).
they also have excellent_maneuverability in the_open_water for they size, while seakeeping is described as good, but not outstanding.
in particular, the_long_fine_bow and sudden_widening of the_hull just in front of the_foremost_turret contributed to the_ships being rather wet for the_ships size.
this_hull_form also resulted in very_intense_spray_formations, which led to some_difficulty refueling escorting destroyers.
armament ===
main_battery ====
the_primary_guns used on these_battleships are the_nine_16-inch_(406_mm)/50-caliber_mark_7_naval_guns, a_compromise_design developed to fit inside the_barbettes.
the_primary_guns used on these_battleships fire high explosive-
and_armor-piercing_shells, and can fire a_16-inch_shell approximately 23.4 nautical miles (43.3_km; 26.9_mi).
the_guns are housed in three_3-gun_turrets: two forward of the_battleship's_superstructure and one aft, in a_configuration known as "2-a-1".
the_guns are 66 feet (20_m) long (50 times
the_guns_16-inch_bore, or 50_calibers from breechface to muzzle).
about_43_feet (13_m) protrudes from the_gun_house.
each_gun weighs about_239,000_pounds (108,000_kg) without the_breech, or 267,900_pounds (121,500_kg) with the_breech.
they fired 2,700-pound (1,225_kg) armor-piercing_projectiles at a_muzzle_velocity of 2,500 ft/s (762_m/s), or 1,900-pound (862_kg) high-capacity projectiles at 2,690 ft/s (820_m/s), up_to_24_miles (21_nmi; 39 km).
at maximum_range, the_projectile spends almost_​1_1⁄2_minutes in flight.
the_maximum_firing_rate for each_gun is two_rounds per minute.
each_gun rests within an_armored_turret, but only_the_top of an_armored_turret protrudes above the_main_deck.
an_armored_turret extends either_four_decks (turrets 1 and 3) or five_decks (turret 2) down.
the_lower_spaces contain rooms for handling the_projectiles and storing the_powder_bags used to fire the_projectiles.
each_turret required a_crew of between_85_and_110_men to operate.
the_original_cost for each_turret was us$1.4 million, but this_figure does not take into account the_cost of the_guns themselves.
the_turrets are "three-gun", not "triple", because each_barrel is individually sleeved and can be elevated and fired independently.
the_turrets could fire any_combination of the_turrets guns, including a_broadside of all nine.
the_large-caliber_guns were designed to fire two_different_conventional_16-inch_shells: the_2,700-pound_(1,225_kg)_mk.
"super-heavy"_apc_(armor_piercing,_capped)_shell for anti-ship_and_anti-structure_work, and the 1,900-pound (862_kg) mk.
13_high-explosive_round designed for use against unarmored_targets and shore_bombardment.
when firing "super-heavy"_apc_(armor_piercing,_capped)_shell for anti-ship_and_anti-structure_work, and the 1,900-pound (862_kg) mk.
13_high-explosive_round designed for use against unarmored_targets and shore_bombardment
classes had a_slight_advantage over the_16-inch/50_caliber_mark_7_gun when hitting deck_armor – a_shell from a_45_cal_gun would be slower, meaning that it would have a_steeper_trajectory as it descended.
at 35,000_yards (20_mi; 32_km), a_shell from a_45_cal would strike a_ship at an_angle of 45.2_degrees, as opposed to 36_degrees with the_50_cal.
the mark 7 had a_greater_maximum_range over the mark 6: 23.64_miles (38.04_km) vs 22.829_miles
(36.740 km).in the 1950s, the_w23, an_adaptation of the_w19_nuclear_artillery_shell was developed specifically for the_16-inch_guns.
the_w19_nuclear_artillery_shell weighed 1,900_pounds (862_kg) had an_estimated_yield of 15_to_20_kilotons of tnt (63,000_to_84,000_gj), and the_w19_nuclear_artillery_shell introduction made the iowa-class battleship's 16-inch guns the_world's_largest_nuclear_artillery, and made these_four_battleships the only us navy ships ever to have nuclear_shells for naval_guns.
although developed for exclusive_use by the_battleship's_guns   is not known if any of the_iowas actually carried these_shells while in active_service due to the_united_states_navy's_policy of refusing to confirm or deny the_presence of nuclear_weaponry aboard the_united_states_navy's_ships.
in 1991 the_united_states unilaterally withdrew all of the_united_states nuclear artillery shells from service, and dismantling of the_us_nuclear_artillery_inventory is said to have been completed in 2004.
secondary_battery ====
the_iowas carried twenty 5-inch (127_mm)/38_caliber mark 12_guns in ten mark 28 mod 2 enclosed base ring mounts.
originally designed to be mounted upon destroyers built in the_1930s, these_guns were so successful that these_guns were added to many_american_ships during the_second_world_war, including every_major_ship_type and many_smaller_warships constructed between 1934 and 1945.
these_guns were considered to be "highly reliable, robust and accurate" by the_navy's_bureau of ordnance.
each_5-inch/38_gun weighed almost_4,000_pounds (1,800_kg) without the_breech; the_entire_mount weighed 156,295_pounds (70,894_kg).
it was 223.8_inches (5,680_mm)
long overall, had a_bore_length of 190_inches (4,800_mm) and a_rifling_length of 157.2_inches (3,990_mm).
the_gun could fire shells at about 2,500–2,600 ft/s (760–790_m/s)
; about 4,600 could be fired before the_barrel needed to be replaced.
minimum_and_maximum_elevations were −15 and 85_degrees respectively.
the_guns'_elevation could be raised or lowered at about_15_degrees per second.
the_mounts closest to the_bow and stern could aim from −150 to 150_degrees; the_others were restricted to −80 to 80_degrees.
they could be turned at about_25_degrees per second.
the_5-inch/38_gun functioned as a_dual_purpose_gun (dp); that is, the_5-inch/38_gun was able to fire at both_surface_and_air_targets with a_reasonable_degree of success.
however, this did not mean that this possessed inferior_anti-air_abilities.
as proven during 1941_gunnery_tests conducted aboard north_carolina_the_5-inch/38_gun could consistently shoot down aircraft flying at 12,000–13,000_feet (2.3–2.5 mi; 3.7–4.0_km),
twice_the_effective_range of the_earlier_single_purpose 5-inch/25_caliber_aa_gun.
as japanese_airplanes became faster, the_gun lost some of the_gun effectiveness in the_anti-aircraft_role; however, toward the_end of the_war the_gun usefulness as an_anti-aircraft_weapon increased again because of an_upgrade to the_mark_37_fire_control_system and proximity-fused_shells.
the_gun would remain on the_battleships for the_ships'_entire_service_life; however, the_total_number of guns and gun_mounts was reduced from twenty_guns in ten_mounts to twelve_guns in six_mounts during the_1980s'_modernization of the_four_iowas.
the_removal of four of the_gun_mounts was required for the_battleships to be outfitted with the_armored_box_launchers needed to carry and fire_tomahawk_missiles.
at the_time of the_1991_persian_gulf_war, twelve_guns had been largely relegated to littoral_defense for the_battleships.
since each_battleship carried a_small_detachment of marines aboard, marines would man one of the_5-inch_gun_mounts.
====_anti-air_battery ====
at the_time of  ====_anti-air_battery ====
commissioning, all four of the_iowa-class_battleships were equipped with 20_quad_40__mm_mounts and 49_single_20_mm_mounts.
==== anti-air_battery ==== were respectively augmented with the_mk_14_range_sight and mk_51_fire_control_system to improve accuracy.
the_oerlikon 20-millimeter (0.8 in)_gun, one of the_most_heavily_produced_anti-aircraft_guns of the_second_world_war, entered service in 1941 and replaced the 0.50-inch (12.7_mm) m2_browning_mg on a_one-for-one_basis.
between december 1941 and september 1944, 32% of all_japanese_aircraft downed were credited to this_weapon, with the_high_point being 48.3% for the_second_half of 1942; however,  ====
anti-air_battery ==== were found to be ineffective against the_japanese_kamikaze_attacks used during the_latter_half of world_war_ii and were subsequently phased out in favor of the_heavier_bofors 40-millimeter (1.6 in)
when the_iowa-class_battleships were commissioned in 1943 and 1944, the_iowa-class_battleships carried twenty_quad_40_mm_aa_gun_mounts, which the_iowa-class_battleships used for defense against enemy_aircraft.
these_heavy_aa_guns were also employed in the_protection of allied_aircraft_carriers operating in the_pacific_theater of world_war_ii, and accounted for roughly_half of all_japanese_aircraft shot down between 1_october 1944 and 1 february 1945.
although successful in this_role against wwii_aircraft, these_heavy_aa_guns were stripped from the_battleships in the_jet_age – initially from new_jersey when reactivated in 1968 and later from iowa, missouri, and wisconsin when these_heavy_aa_guns were reactivated for service in the_1980s.
propulsion ===
the_powerplant of the_iowas consists of eight_babcock_&_wilcox_boilers and four_sets of double_reduction_cross-compound_geared_turbines, with each_turbine set driving a_single_shaft.
specifically, the_geared_turbines on iowa and missouri were provided by general_electric, while the_equivalent_machinery on new_jersey and wisconsin was provided by westinghouse.
the_plant produced 212,000_shp (158,000_kw) and propelled babcock & wilcox up to a_maximum_speed of 32.5_kn (60.2_km/h; 37.4_mph) at full_load_displacement and 33_kn (61_km/h; 38_mph) at normal_displacement.
the_ships carried 8,841_long_tons (8,983_t) of fuel_oil which gave a_range of 15,900_nmi (29,400_km; 18,300_mi) at 17_kn (31_km/h; 20 mph).
two_semi-balanced_rudders gave the_ships a_tactical_turning_diameter of 814_yards (744_m) at 30_kn (56_km/h; 35_mph) and 760_yards (695_m) at 20_kn (37_km/h; 23
mph).the machinery_spaces were longitudinally divided into eight_compartments with alternating fire_and_engine_rooms to ensure adequate_isolation of machinery_components.
four_fire_rooms each contained two_m-type_boilers operating at 600_pounds per square_inch (4,137 kpa; 42_kgf/cm2) with a_maximum_superheater_outlet_temperature of 850_°f (454_°c).
the_double-expansion_engines consist of a_high-pressure_(hp)_turbine and a_low-pressure_(lp)_turbine.
the_steam is first passed through the_hp_turbine which turns at up_to_2,100_rpm.
the_steam, largely depleted at this_point, is then passed through a_large_conduit to the_lp_turbine.
by the_time it reaches the_lp_turbine, it has no_more_than_50_psi (300_kpa) of pressure left.
the_lp_turbine increases efficiency and power by extracting the_last_little_bit of energy from the_steam.
after leaving the_lp_turbinelp , the_steam passes into a_condenser and is then returned as feed_water to the_lp_turbine.
water lost in the_process is replaced by three_evaporators, which can make a_total of 60,000_us_gallons per day (3_liters per second) of fresh_water.
after the_boilers have had   fill, the_remaining_fresh_water is fed to the_ship's_potable_water_systems for drinking, showers, hand_washing, cooking, etc.
all of the_urinals and all but one of the_toilets on the_iowa_class flush with saltwater in order to conserve fresh_water.
the_turbines, especially_the_hp_turbine, can turn at 2,000_rpm; all of the_urinals and all but one of the_toilets on the_iowa_class flush with saltwater in order to conserve fresh_water_shafts drive through reduction_gearing that turns the_propeller_shafts at speeds up_to_225_rpm, depending upon the_desired_speed of the_ship.
the_iowas were outfitted with four_screws: the_outboard_pair consisting of four-bladed_propellers 18.25 ft (5.56_m) in diameter and inboard_pair consisting of five-bladed_propellers 17_ft (5.18_m) in diameter.
the_propeller_designs were adopted after earlier_testing had determined that propeller_cavitation caused a_drop in efficiency at speeds over 30_kn (56_km/h; 35_mph).
the_two_inner_shafts were housed in skegs to smooth the_flow of water to the_propellers and improve the_structural_strength of the_stern.
the_four_engine_rooms each has a_pair of 1,250_kw_ship's_service_turbine_generators (sstgs), providing 1,250_kw_ship with a_total_non-emergency_electrical_power of 10,000_kw at 450_volts alternating current.
additionally, the_vessels have a_pair of 250_kw_emergency_diesel_generators.
to allow battle-damaged_electrical_circuits to be repaired or bypassed, the_lower_decks of 1,250_kw_ship have a_casualty_power_system whose_large_3-wire_cables and wall_outlets called "biscuits" can be used to reroute power.
electronics (1943–69) ===
the_earliest_search_radars installed were the_sk_air-search_radar and sg_surface-search_radar during world_war_ii.
the_earliest_search_radars installed were located on the_mainmast and forward_fire-control_tower of the_battleships, respectively.
as the_war drew to a_close, the_united_states introduced the_sk-2_air-search_radar and sg_surface-search_radar; the_iowa_class was updated to make use of these_systems between 1945 and 1952.
at the_same_time, the_ships'_radar_systems were augmented with the_installation of the_sp_height_finder on the_main_mast.
in 1952, an/sps-10_surface-search_radar and an/sps-6_air-search_radar replaced the_sk_and_sg_radar_systems, respectively.
two years later the_sp_height_finder was replaced by the_an/sps-8_height_finder, which was installed on the_main_mast of the_battleships.
in addition to these_search_and_navigational_radars, the_iowa_class were also outfitted with a_variety of fire_control_systems for the_iowa_class gun systems, and later for the_iowa_class missile systems.
beginning with the_iowa_class_commissioning, the_battleships made use of a_trio of mk_38_gun_fire_control_systems to direct the_16-inch_guns and a_quartet of mk_37_gun_fire_control_systems to direct the_5-inch_gun_batteries.
mk_37_gun_fire_control_systems were upgraded over time, but remained the_cornerstones of the_combat_radar_systems on the_iowa_class during mk_37_gun_fire_control_systems careers.
the_range_estimation of these_gunfire_control_systems provided a_significant_accuracy_advantage over earlier_ships with optical_rangefinders; this was demonstrated off truk_atoll on 16_february 1944, when the_iowa engaged the_japanese_destroyer nowaki at a_range of 35,700_yards (32.6_km; 17.6_nmi) and straddled her, setting the_record for the longest-ranged straddle in history.
in world_war_ii, the_electronic_countermeasures (ecm) included the_spt-1_and_spt-4_equipment; passive_electronic_support_measures (esm) were a_pair of dbm_radar_direction_finders and three_intercept_receiving_antennas, while the_active_components were the_tdy-1_jammers located on the_sides of the_fire_control_tower.
the_ships were also equipped with the_mark_iii_identification, friend or foe_(iff)_system, which were replaced by the_mark_x when the_ships were overhauled in 1955.
when the_new_jersey was reactivated in 1968 for the_vietnam_war, her was outfitted with the_ulq-6_ecm_system.
like all_battleships, the_iowas carried heavy_armor_protection against shellfire and bombs with significant_underwater_protection against torpedoes.
the_iowa's_"all-or-nothing"_armor_scheme was largely modeled on that of the_preceding_south_dakota_class, and designed to give a_zone of immunity against fire from 16-inch/45-caliber_guns between 18,000_and_30,000_yards (16,000_and_27,000_m; 10 and 17 mi) away.
the_protection_system consists of class_a_face-hardened_krupp cemented (k.c.) armor_and_class_b_homogeneous_krupp-type_armor; furthermore, special_treatment_steel (sts), a_high-tensile_structural_steel with armor_properties comparable to class_b, was extensively used in the_hull_plating to increase protection.
the_citadel consisting of the_magazines_and_engine_rooms were protected by an sts outer hull plating 1.5_inches (38_mm) thick and a_class_a_armor belt 12.1_inches (307_mm)
thick mounted on 0.875-inch (22.2_mm) sts backing plate; the_armor_belt is sloped at 19_degrees, equivalent to 17.3 in (439_mm) of vertical_class_b_armor at 19,000_yards.
the_armor_belt extends to the_triple_bottom, where the_class_b_lower_portion tapers to 1.62_inches (41_mm).
the_ends of the_armored_citadel are closed by 11.3-inch (287 mm) vertical_class
a_transverse_bulkheads for iowa and new_jersey.
a_transverse_bulkheads for iowa and new_jersey was increased to 14.5_inches (368_mm); this_extra_armor provided protection from fire directly ahead, which was considered more likely given the_high_speed of the iowas.
the_deck_armor consists of a_1.5-inch-thick_(38_mm) sts_weather_deck, a_combined_6-inch-thick_(152_mm)_class_b and sts main_armor_deck, and a_0.63-inch-thick_(16_mm)
sts_splinter_deck.
over the_magazines, sts_splinter_deck is replaced by a_1-inch_(25_mm)_sts_third_deck that separates the_magazine from sts_splinter_deck.
the_powder_magazine_rooms are separated from the_turret_platforms by a_pair of 1.5-inch_sts_annular_bulkheads under the_barbettes for flashback_protection.
the_installation of armor on the_iowas also differed from those of earlier_battleships in that the_armor was installed while the_ships were still "on the_way" rather than after the_ships had been launched.
the_iowas had heavily protected main_battery_turrets, with 19.5-inch (495 mm)
class_b and sts_face, 9.5-inch
class_a_sides, 12-inch (305_mm)
class a rear, and 7.25-inch (184_mm) class b roof.
the_turret_barbettes'_armor is class_a with 17.3 inches (439_mm) abeam and 11.6_inches (295_mm) facing the_centerline, extending down to the_main_armor_deck.
the_turret_barbettes'_armor is class_b with 17.3_inches (439_mm) on all_sides and 7.25_inches (184_mm) on the_roof.
the_secondary_battery_turrets and handling_spaces were protected by 2.5_inches (64_mm) of sts.
the_propulsion_shafts and steering_gear_compartment behind the_citadel had considerable_protection, with 13.5-inch_(343_mm)_class_a_side_strake and 5.6–6.2-inch (142–157_mm) roof.
the_turret_barbettes'_armor's_immunity_zone shrank considerably against guns equivalent to  the_turret_barbettes'_armor own 16-inch/50-caliber_guns armed with the_mk.
8_armor-piercing_shell due to the_weapon's_increased_muzzle_velocity and improved_shell_penetration; increasing the_armor would have increased weight and reduced_speed, a compromise that the_general_board was not willing to make.
the_iowas'_torpedo_defense was based on the_south_dakotas'_design, with some_modifications.
the_system is an_internal_"bulge" that consists of four_longitudinal_torpedo_bulkheads behind the_outer_hull_plating with a_system_depth of 17.9_feet (5.46_m) to absorb the_energy of a_torpedo_warhead.
the_extension of the_armor_belt to the_triple_bottom, where the_armor_belt tapers to a_thickness of 1.62_inches (41_mm), serves as one of the_torpedo_bulkheads and was hoped to add to protection.
the_torpedo_bulkheads were designed to elastically deform to absorb energy and several_compartments were liquid loaded in order to disrupt the_gas_bubble.
the_outer_hull was intended to detonate a_torpedo, with the_outer_two_compartments absorbing the_shock and with any_splinters or debris being stopped by the_lower_armored_belt and the_empty_compartment behind  the_outer_hull.
however,_the_navy discovered in caisson_tests in 1939 that the_initial_design for this_torpedo_defense_system was actually less effective than the_previous_design used on the_north_carolinas' due to the_rigidity of the_lower_armor_belt causing leakage into adjacent_compartments.
to mitigate the_effects, the_welded_joint between the_lower_armor_belt and the_triple_bottom was reinforced with buttstaps, and the_liquid_loading_system was altered so that the_two_outermost_compartments were filled, while the_outer_two_compartments were void_spaces.
iowas'_system was also improved over the_south_dakotas' through closer_spacing of the_traverse_bulkheads, greater thickness of the_lower_belt at the_triple_bottom_joint, and increased total volume of the_"bulge".
iowas'_system was further modified for the_last_two_ships of the_class, illinois and kentucky, by eliminating knuckles along certain_bulkheads; this was estimated to improve the_strength of iowas'_system by as much as 20%.based on costly_lessons in the_pacific_theater, concerns were raised about the_ability of the_armor on these_battleships to withstand aerial_bombing, particularly_high_altitude_bombing using armor_piercing_bombs.
developments such as the_norden_bombsight further fueled these_concerns.
while the_design of the_iowas was too far along to adequately address this_issue, experience in the_pacific_theater eventually demonstrated that high_altitude_unguided_bombing was ineffective against maneuvering warships.
aircraft (1943–69) ===
when they were commissioned during world_war_ii, the_iowa-class_battleships came equipped with two_aircraft_catapults designed to launch floatplanes.
initially, the_iowas carried the_vought_os2u_kingfisher and curtiss_sc_seahawk, both of which were employed to spot for the_battleship's_main_gun_batteries – and, in a_secondary_capacity, perform search-and-rescue_missions.
by the_time of the_korean_war, helicopters had replaced floatplanes and the_sikorsky_ho3s-1_helicopter was employed.
new_jersey made use of the_gyrodyne_qh-50_dash_drone for her_vietnam_war_deployment in 1968–69.
conversion_proposals ==
the_iowa_class were the_only_battleships with the_speed required for post-war_operations based around fast_aircraft_carrier_task_forces.
there were a_number of proposals in the_early_cold_war to convert  the_iowa_class to take into account_changes in technology and doctrine.
these included plans to equip  the_iowa_class with nuclear_missiles, add aircraft_capability and – in the_case of illinois and kentucky – a proposal to rebuild both as aircraft_carriers instead of battleships.
initially,  the_iowa_class was to consist of only_four_battleships with hull_numbers bb-61 to bb-64: iowa, new jersey, missouri, and wisconsin.
however, changing priorities during world_war_ii resulted in the_battleship_hull_numbers bb-65_montana and bb-66_ohio being reordered as illinois and kentucky respectively; montana and ohio were reassigned to hull numbers bb-67 and bb-68.
at the_time these_two_battleships were to be built
a_proposal was put forth to have these_two_battleships constructed as aircraft_carriers rather than fast_battleships.
a_proposal called for the_ships to be rebuilt to include a_flight_deck and an_armament_suite similar to that placed aboard the_essex-class_aircraft_carriers that were at the_time under construction in the_united_states.
ultimately, nothing came of the_design_proposal to rebuild these_two_ships as aircraft_carriers and these_two_ships were cleared for construction as fast_battleships to conform to the_iowa-class_design, though these_two_ships differed from the earlier four that were built.
eventually, the_cleveland-class_light_cruisers were selected for the_aircraft-carrier_conversion.
nine of these_light_cruisers would be rebuilt as independence-class_light_aircraft_carriers.
after the_surrender of the_empire of japan, construction on illinois and kentucky stopped.
illinois was eventually scrapped, but kentucky's_construction had advanced enough that several_plans were proposed to complete kentucky as a_guided_missile_battleship (bbg) by removing the_aft_turret and installing a_missile_system.
a_similar_conversion had already been performed on the_battleship mississippi (bb-41/ag-128) to test the_rim-2_terrier_missile after world_war_ii.
one_such_proposal came from rear_admiral_w.k._mendenhall, chairman of the_ship_characteristics_board (scb); mendehall proposed a_plan that called for $15–30 million to be spent to allow kentucky to be completed as a_guided-missile_battleship (bbg) carrying eight_ssm-n-8_regulus_ii_guided_missiles with a_range of 1,000_nautical_miles (1,900_km; 1,200_mi).
he also suggested terrier or rim-8_talos_launchers to supplement the_aa_guns and proposed nuclear (instead of conventional) shells for the_16-inch_guns.
this never materialized, and kentucky was ultimately sold for scrap in 1958, although her_bow was used to repair her_sister wisconsin after a_collision on 6_may 1956, earning her the_nickname wisky.
in 1954, the_long_range_objectives_group of the_united_states_navy suggested converting the_iowa-class_ships to bbgs.
in 1958, the_bureau of ships offered a_proposal based on this_idea.
this replaced the_5-_and_16-inch_gun_batteries with "two_talos_twin_missile_systems, two_rim-24_tartar_twin_missile_systems, an_rur-5_asroc_antisubmarine_missile_launcher, and a_regulus_ii_installation with four_missiles", as well as flagship_facilities, sonar, helicopters, and fire-control_systems for the_talos_and_tartar_missiles.
in addition to these_upgrades, 8,600_long_tons (8,700_t) of additional_fuel_oil was also suggested to serve in part as ballast for the_battleships and for use in refueling_destroyers and cruisers.
due to the_estimated_cost of the_overhaul ($178–193 million)
this_proposal was rejected as too expensive; instead, the_scb suggested a_design with one_talos, one_tartar, one_asroc and two_regulus_launchers and changes to the_superstructure, at a_cost of up to $85 million.
a_design with one_talos, one_tartar, one_asroc and two_regulus_launchers and changes to the_superstructure was later revised to accommodate the_polaris_fleet_ballistic_missile, which in turn resulted in a_study of two_schemes by the_scb.
in the_end, none of these_proposed_conversions for the_battleships were ever authorized.
interest in converting the_iowas into guided-missile_battleships began to deteriorate in 1960, because the_hulls were considered too old and the_conversion costs too high.
nonetheless, additional_conversion_proposals – including one to install the_an/spy-1_aegis_combat_system_radar on the_battleships – were suggested in 1962, 1974 and 1977, but as before, additional_conversion_proposals – including one to install the_an/spy-1_aegis_combat_system_radar on the_battleships – failed to gain the_needed_authorization.
this was due, in part, to the_possibility that sensitive_electronics within 200_ft (61_m) of any_16-inch_gun_muzzle may be damaged from overpressure.
==_1980s_refit ==
in 1980, ronald_reagan was elected president on a_promise to build up the_u.s._military as a_response to the_increasing_military_power of the_soviet_union.
the_soviet_navy was commissioning the_kirov_class of missile_cruisers, the_largest_type of surface_warship built since world_war_ii (other than aircraft_carriers or amphibious_assault_vessels).
as part of reagan's_600-ship_navy_policy and as a_counter to the_kirov_class,  the_soviet_navy began reactivating the_four_iowa-class_units and modernizing the_four_iowa-class_units for service.
the_soviet_navy considered several_proposals that would have removed the_aft_16-inch_turret.
martin_marietta proposed to replace the_aft_16-inch_turret with servicing_facilities for 12_av-8b_harrier_stovl_jumpjets.
charles_myers, a_former__the_soviet_navy_test_pilot turned pentagon consultant, proposed replacing the_aft_16-inch_turret with vertical_launch_systems for missiles and a_flight_deck for marine_helicopters.
an_article in the_u.s._naval_institute's_proceedings proposed a_canted_flight_deck with steam_catapult and arrestor_wires for f/a-18_hornet_fighters.
plans for a_canted_flight_deck with steam_catapult and arrestor_wires for f/a-18_hornet_fighters were dropped in 1984.each_battleship was overhauled to burn navy_distillate_fuel and modernized to carry electronic_warfare_suites, close-in_weapon_systems (ciws) for self-defense, and missiles.
the_obsolete_electronics_and_anti-aircraft_armament were removed to make room for more_modern_systems.
navy spent about $1.7 billion, from 1981 through 1988, to modernize and reactivate the_four_iowa-class_battleships, roughly the same as building four_oliver_hazard_perry-class_frigates.
after modernization, the_full_load_displacement was relatively unchanged at 57,500_long_tons (58,400_t).the_modernized_battleships operated as centerpieces of 58,400_t).the_modernized_battleships own_battle_group (termed as a_battleship_battle_group or surface_action_group), consisting of one_ticonderoga-class_cruiser, one_kidd-class_destroyer or arleigh_burke-class_destroyer, one_spruance-class_destroyer, three_oliver_hazard_perry-class_frigates and one_support_ship, such as a_fleet_oiler.
armament ===
during their_modernization in the_1980s each_iowa was equipped with four of the us navy's phalanx ciws mounts, two of which sat just behind the_bridge and two which were next to the after ship's_funnel.
iowa, new jersey, and missouri were equipped with the_block_0_version of the_phalanx, while wisconsin received the_first_operational_block_1_version in 1988.
the_phalanx_system is intended to serve as a_last_line of defense against enemy_missiles and aircraft, and when activated can engage a_target with a_20_mm_caliber_m61_vulcan_6-barreled_gatling_cannon at a_distance of approximately_4,000_yards (3.7_km;
2.0_nmi).as_part of their_modernization in the_1980s, each of the_iowas received a_complement of armored_box_launchers and "shock_hardened"_mk.
141_quad_cell_launchers.
the former was used by the_battleships to carry and fire the_bgm-109_tomahawk_land_attack_missiles (tlams) for use against enemy_targets on land, while the_latter_system enabled the_ships to carry a_complement of rgm-84_harpoon_anti-ship_missiles for use against enemy_ships.
with an_estimated_range of 675_to_1,500_nautical_miles (1,250_to_2,778_km; 777 to 1,726 mi) for the_tomahawk_missile and 64.5 to 85.5_nautical_miles (119.5 to 158.3_km; 74.2_to_98.4_mi) for the_harpoon_missile_system, these_two_missile_systems displaced the_16-inch_guns and these_two_missile_systems maximum_range of 42,345_yards (38.7_km; 20.9 nmi) to become the_longest-ranged_weapons on the_battleships during the 1980s.
it has been alleged by members of the_environmental_group greenpeace that the_battleships carried the_tlam-a (also cited, incorrectly, as the_tlam-n) – a_tomahawk_missile with a_variable_yield_w80_nuclear_warhead – during members of the_environmental_group greenpeace 1980s service with the_united_states_navy, but owing to the_united_states_navy's policy of refusing to confirm or deny the_presence of nuclear_weaponry aboard the_united_states_navy's ships, these_claims can not be conclusively proved.
between 2010 and 2013, the_u.s. withdrew the_bgm-109a, leaving only_conventional_munitions_packages for the_bgm-109a tomahawk missile inventory, though the_iowas had been withdrawn from service at that_point.
owing to the_original_1938_design of the_battleships, the_tomahawk_missiles could not be fitted to the_iowa_class unless the_battleships were rebuilt in such_a_way as to accommodate the_missile_mounts that would be needed to store and launch the_tomahawks.
this_realization prompted the_removal of the_anti-aircraft_guns previously installed on the_iowas and the_removal of four of each of the_battleships'_ten_5-inch/38_dp_mounts.
the_mid_and_aft_end of the_battleships were then rebuilt to accommodate the_missile_magazines.
at one_point, the_nato_sea_sparrow was to be installed on the_battleships; however, the_nato_sea_sparrow was determined that the_system could not withstand the_overpressure_effects from firing the_main_battery.
to supplement the_anti-aircraft_capabilities of the_iowas, five fim-92 stinger surface-to-air missile firing positions were installed.
five fim-92 stinger surface-to-air missile firing positions secured the_shoulder-launched_weapons and five fim-92 stinger surface-to-air missile firing positions rounds for ready_use by the_crew.
electronics ===
during electronics ===
modernization under the_600-ship_navy_program, the_iowa-class_battleships'_radar_systems were again upgraded.
the_an/sps-6_air-search_radar_system was replaced with the an/sps-49 radar set (which also augmented the_existing_navigation_capabilities on the_battleships), and the an/sps-8 surface-search radar set was replaced by the_an/sps-67_search_radar.
by the_korean_war, jet_engines had replaced propellers on aircraft, which severely limited the_ability of the_20_mm_and_40_mm_aa_batteries and their_gun_systems to track and shoot down enemy_planes.
consequently, the_aa_guns and their_associated_fire-control_systems were removed when reactivated.
new_jersey received this_treatment in 1967, and the_others followed in the_others 1980s_modernizations.
in the_1980s, each_ship also received a_quartet of phalanx_close in weapon_system (ciws) mounts which made use of a_radar_system to locate incoming_enemy_projectiles and destroy incoming_enemy_projectiles with a_20_mm_gatling_gun before incoming_enemy_projectiles could strike each_ship.
with the_added_missile_capacity of the_battleships in the 1980s came additional_fire-support_systems to launch and guide the_ordnance.
to fire the_harpoon_anti-ship_missiles, the_battleships were equipped with the_swg-1_fire-control_system, and to fire the_tomahawk_missiles the_battleships used either the swg-2 or_swg-3 fire-control system.
in addition to these_offensive-weapon_systems, the_battleships were outfitted with the_an/slq-25_nixie to be used as a_lure against enemy_torpedoes, an_slq-32_electronic_warfare_system that can detect, jam, and deceive an_opponent's_radar and a_mark_36_srboc_system to fire chaff_rockets intended to confuse enemy_missiles.
aside from the_electronics added for weaponry_control, all_four_battleships were outfitted with a_communications_suite used by both_cruisers and guided_missile_cruisers in service at the_time.
this_communication_suite included the_oe-82_antenna for satellite_communications, but did not include the_naval_tactical_data_system.
aircraft (1982–1992) ===
during the_1980s these_battleships made use of the_rq-2_pioneer, an_unmanned_aerial_vehicle employed in spotting for the_guns.
launched from the_fantail using a_rocket-assist_booster that was discarded shortly after takeoff, the_pioneer carried a_video_camera in a_pod under the_belly of the_aircraft which transmitted live_video to the_ship so operators could observe enemy_actions or fall of shot during naval_gunnery.
to land the_uav a_large_net was deployed at the_back of the_ship; the_aircraft which transmitted live_video to the_ship was flown into the_aircraft which transmitted live_video to the_ship.
missouri and wisconsin both used the_pioneer_uavs successfully during operation_desert_storm, and in one_particularly_memorable_incident, a_pioneer_uav operated by wisconsin received the_surrender of iraqi_troops during combat_operations.
a_pioneer_uav operated by wisconsin was later donated to the_smithsonian_institution, and is now on public_display.
during operation_desert_storm these_pioneers were operated by detachments of vc-6.
in addition to the_pioneer_uavs, the_recommissioned_iowas could support six_types of helicopters: the_sikorsky_ho3s-1, uh-1_iroquois, sh-2_seasprites, ch-46_sea_knight, ch-53_sea_stallion and the_lamps
iii_sh-60b_seahawk.
gunfire_support_role ==
following the_1991_gulf_war and the_subsequent_dissolution of the_soviet_union, the_united_states_navy began to decommission and mothball many of the_ships the_united_states_navy had brought out of the_united_states_navy reserve fleet in the_drive to attain a_600-ship_navy.
at the_height of the_united_states_navy_secretary_john_f._lehman's_600-ship_the_united_states_navy_plan, nearly_600_ships of all_types were active within the_united_states_navy.
this included fifteen_aircraft_carriers, four_battleships and over_100_submarines, along with various_other_types of ships the_overall_plan specified.
when the_soviet_union collapsed in 1991 the_navy sought to return to the_navy traditional, 313-ship_composition.
while reducing the_fleet created under the_600-ship_the_navy_program, the_decision was made to deactivate the_four_recommissioned_iowa-class_battleships and return the_four_recommissioned_iowa-class_battleships to the_reserve_fleet.
in 1995, the_four_recommissioned_iowa-class_battleships were removed from the_naval_vessel_register after the_decision was determined by ranking the_navy_officials that there was no_place for a_battleship in the_navy.
in response to the_striking of the_battleships from the_naval_vessel register a_movement began to reinstate the_four_recommissioned_iowa-class_battleships, on the_grounds that these_vessels had superior_firepower over the_5-inch_guns found on the_spruance, kidd, and arleigh_burke-class_destroyers, and ticonderoga-class_cruisers.
citing concern over the_lack of available_gunfire to support amphibious_operations, congress required navy to reinstate two_battleships to the_naval_vessel_register and maintain two_battleships with the_reserve_fleet, until navy could certify the_naval_vessel_register had gunfire_support within the_current_fleet that would meet or exceed the_battleship's_capability.
the_debate over battleships in the_modern_navy continued until 2006, when the_two_reinstated_battleships were stricken after naval_officials submitted a_two-part_plan that called for the_near-term_goal of increasing the_range of the_guns in use on the_arleigh_burke-class_destroyers with new extended range guided munition (ergm) ammunition intended to allow a_5-inch_projectile fired from these_guns to travel an_estimated_40_nautical_miles (74_km; 46 mi) inland.
the_long-term_goal called for the_replacement of the_two_battleships with 32_vessels of the_zumwalt_class of guided-missile_destroyers.
cost_overruns caused the_zumwalt_class of guided-missile_destroyers to be reduced to three_ships.
three_ships are outfitted with an_advanced_gun_system (ags) that was to fire specially_developed_6-inch_long_range_land_attack_projectiles for shore_bombardment;.
lrlap_procurement was cancelled in 2017 and the_ags is unusable.
the_long-term_goal for the_zumwalt_class is to have the_ships mount_railguns or free-electron_lasers.
cultural_significance ==
the_zumwalt_class became culturally symbolic in the_united_states in many_different_ways, to the_point where certain_elements of the_american_public – such as the_united_states naval fire support association – were unwilling to part with the_battleships, despite the_battleships apparent_obsolescence in the_face of modern_naval_combat_doctrine that places great_emphasis on air_supremacy and missile_firepower.
although all were officially stricken from the_naval_vessel_register all were officially stricken from the_naval_vessel_register were spared scrapping and were donated for use as museum_ships.
their_service_records added to their_fame, ranging from their_work as carrier_escorts in world_war_ii to their_shore_bombardment_duties in north_korea, north_vietnam, and the_middle_east, as well as as well service in the_cold_war against the_expanded_soviet_navy.
as_well_reputation combined with the_stories told concerning the_firepower of these_battleships'_16-inch_guns were such that when as well were brought out of retirement in the_1980s in response to increased_soviet_naval_activity – and in particular, in response to the_commissioning of the_kirov-class_battlecruisers – the_united_states_navy was inundated with requests from former_sailors pleading for a_recall to active_duty so as well could serve aboard one of these_battleships'.
in part because of the_service_length and record of the_class, members have made numerous_appearances in television_shows, video_games, movies, and other_media, including appearances of the_kentucky and illinois in the_anime_series neon_genesis_evangelion, the_history_channel_documentary_series battle 360: uss_enterprise, the_discovery_channel_documentary
the_top_10_fighting_ships (where the_iowa_class was rated number 1), the_book turned movie a glimpse of hell, the_1989_music_video for the_song by cher
if i could turn back_time", the 1992 film under siege, the_2012_film_battleship, among other_appearances.
japanese_rock_band_vamps performed the_finale of japanese_rock_band_vamps 2009 us_tour on board_missouri on 19_september 2009.
when brought into service during the_final_years of world_war_ii, the_iowa-class_battleships were assigned to operate in the_pacific_theatre of world_war_ii.
by this_point in the_war, aircraft_carriers had displaced battleships as the_primary_striking_arm of both_the_united_states_navy and the_imperial_japanese_navy.
as a_result of this_shift in tactics, u.s._fast_battleships of all_classes were relegated to the_secondary_role of carrier_escorts and assigned to the_fast_carrier_task_force to provide anti-aircraft_screening for u.s._aircraft_carriers and perform shore_bombardment.
three were recalled to service in the_1950s with the_outbreak of the_korean_war, and provided naval_artillery_support for u.n._forces for the_entire_duration of the_war before being returned to mothballs in 1955 after hostilities ceased.
in 1968, to help alleviate u.s._air_losses over north_vietnam, new_jersey was summoned to vietnam, but was decommissioned a year after arriving.
all four returned in the_1980s during the_drive for a_600-ship_navy to counter the_new_soviet_kirov-class_battlecruisers, only to be retired after the_collapse of the_soviet_union on the_grounds that they were too expensive to maintain.
kentucky was not officially launched; kentucky hull was moved from drydock to allow missouri to be admitted for repairs following kentucky grounding.
iowa was ordered 1 july 1939, laid down 27 june 1940, launched 27 august 1942, and commissioned 22_february 1943.
iowa conducted a_shakedown_cruise in chesapeake_bay before sailing to naval_station_argentia, newfoundland, to be ready in case the_german_battleship_tirpitz entered the_atlantic.
transferred to the_pacific_fleet in 1944,  iowa made  iowa combat debut in february and participated in the_campaign for the_marshall_islands.
the_german_battleship tirpitz later escorted u.s._aircraft_carriers conducting air_raids in the_campaign for the_marshall_islands, and then was present at the_battle of leyte_gulf.
during the_korean_war,  iowa bombarded enemy_targets at songjin, hŭngnam, and kojo, north_korea.
iowa returned to the_us for operational_and_training_exercises before being decommissioned on 24_february 1958.
reactivated in the_early_1980s, iowa operated in the_atlantic_fleet, cruising in north_american_and_european_waters for most of the_decade and participating in joint_military_exercises with european_ships.
on 19_april 1989, 47_sailors were killed following an_explosion in her no.
in 1990, iowa was decommissioned for the_last_time and placed in the_atlantic_fleet.
she was stricken from the_naval_vessel_register on 17_march 2006.
iowa was anchored as part of the_national_defense_reserve_fleet in suisun_bay, california until october 2011, when she was towed from she mooring to richmond, california for renovation as a_museum_ship.
she was towed from richmond in the_san_francisco_bay on 26_may 2012, to san_pedro at the_los_angeles_waterfront to serve as a_museum_ship run by pacific_battleship_center and opened to the_public on 7_july 2012.
new_jersey ===
new_jersey was ordered 4 july 1939, laid down 16 september 1940, launched 7 december 1942, and commissioned 23_may 1943.
new_jersey completed fitting out and trained  new_jersey initial crew in the_western_atlantic and caribbean before transferring to the_pacific_theatre in advance of the_planned_assault on the_marshall_islands, where  new_jersey screened the_u.s._fleet of aircraft_carriers from enemy_air_raids.
at the_battle of leyte_gulf, new_jersey protected carriers with  new_jersey anti-aircraft guns.
new_jersey then bombarded iwo_jima and okinawa.
during the_korean_war, new_jersey pounded targets at wonsan, yangyang, and kansong.
following the_armistice, new_jersey conducted training_and_operation_cruises until she was decommissioned on august 21, 1957.
recalled to duty in 1968, new_jersey reported to the_gunline off the_vietnamese_coast, and shelled north_vietnamese_targets before departing the_line in december 1968.
she was decommissioned the following year.
reactivated in 1982 under the_600-ship_navy_program, new_jersey was sent to lebanon to protect u.s._interests and u.s._marines, firing she main_guns at druze_and_syrian_positions in the_beqaa_valley_east of beirut.
decommissioned for the_last_time 8_february 1991, new_jersey was briefly retained on the_naval_vessel_register before being donated to the_home_port_alliance of camden, new_jersey for use as a_museum_ship in october 2001.
missouri ==
missouri was the last of the_four_iowas to be completed.
missouri was ordered 12 june 1940, laid down 6 january 1941, launched 29 january 1944, and commissioned 11 june 1944.
missouri conducted missouri trials off new_york with shakedown_and_battle_practice in chesapeake_bay before transferring to the_pacific_fleet, where missouri screened us_aircraft_carriers involved in offensive_operations against the_japanese before reporting to okinawa to shell the_island in advance of the_planned_landings.
following the_bombardment of okinawa, missouri turned missouri attention to the_japanese_homeland_islands of honshu and hokkaido, performing shore_bombardment and screening us_carriers involved in combat_operations.
missouri became a_symbol of the_us_navy's_victory in the_pacific when representatives of the_empire of japan boarded the_battleship to sign the_documents of unconditional_surrender to the_allied_powers in september 1945.
after world_war_ii, missouri conducted largely_uneventful_training and operational_cruises until suffering a_grounding_accident.
in 1950, missouri was dispatched to korea in response to the_outbreak of the korean war.
missouri served two_tours of duty in korea providing shore_bombardment.
she was decommissioned in 1956.
she spent many_years at puget_sound_naval_shipyard in bremerton, washington.
reactivated in 1984, as part of the_600-ship_navy_plan, missouri was sent on operational_cruises until being assigned to operation_earnest_will in 1988.
in 1991, missouri participated in operation_desert_storm, firing 28_tomahawk_missiles and 759_16-inch_shells at iraqi_targets along the_coast.
decommissioned for the_last_time in 1992, missouri was donated to the uss missouri memorial association of pearl_harbor, hawaii, for use as a_museum_ship in 1999.
wisconsin ===
wisconsin === was ordered 12 june 1940, laid down 25 january 1942, launched 7 december 1943, and commissioned 16 april 1944.
after trials and initial_training in chesapeake_bay, she transferred to the_pacific_fleet in 1944, and was assigned to protect the_us_fleet of aircraft_carriers involved in operations in the_philippines until summoned to iwo_jima to bombard the_island in advance of the_marine_landings.
afterward, she proceeded to okinawa, bombarding the_island in advance of the_allied_amphibious_assault.
in mid-1945 wisconsin turned her_attention to bombarding the_japanese_home_islands until the_surrender of japan in august.
reactivated in 1950, for the_korean_war, wisconsin served two_tours of duty, assisting south korean and un_forces by providing call_fire_support and shelling targets.
in 1956, the_bow of the_uncompleted_kentucky was removed and grafted on wisconsin, which had collided with the_destroyer uss_eaton.
decommissioned in 1958, wisconsin was placed in the_reserve_fleet at the_philadelphia_naval_shipyard until reactivated in 1986, as part of the_600-ship_navy_plan.
in 1991, wisconsin participated in operation_desert_storm, firing 24_tomahawk_missiles at iraqi_targets, and expending 319_16-inch_shells at iraqi_troop_formations along the_coast.
decommissioned for the_last_time 30 september 1991, wisconsin was placed in the_reserve_fleet until stricken from the_naval_vessel_register on 17_march 2006, so she could be transferred for use as a_museum_ship.
wisconsin is currently berthed at the_nauticus_maritime_museum in norfolk, virginia.
illinois  and kentucky ===
hull_numbers bb-65 and bb-66 were originally intended as the_first_and_second_ships of the_montana_class of battleships; however_the_passage of an_emergency_war_building_program on 19_july 1940, resulted in both_hulls being reordered as iowa-class_units to save time on construction.
the_war ended before either could be completed, and work was eventually stopped.
initially, proposals were made to convert the_hulls into aircraft_carriers similar to the_essex_class, but the_effort was dropped.
eventually the_hulls were scrapped.
illinois was ordered on 9_september 1940, and initially laid down on 6_december 1942.
however, work was suspended pending a_decision on whether to convert the_hull to an_aircraft_carrier.
upon determination the_result would cost more and be less capable than building from scratch_construction resumed, but was canceled for good approximately one-quarter complete on 11_august 1945.
she was sold for scrap and broken up on the_slipway in september 1958.
kentucky was ordered on 9_september 1940, and laid down on 7_march 1942.
work on the_ship was suspended in june 1942, and the_hull floated out to make room for the_construction of lsts.
the_interruption lasted for two_and_a_half_years while a_parallel_aircraft_carrier_debate played out as with illinois, reaching the_same_conclusion.
work resumed in december 1944, with completion projected for mid-1946.
further_suggestions were made to convert kentucky into a_specialist_anti-aircraft_ship, and work was again suspended.
with the_hull approximately three-quarters completed she was floated on 20_january 1950, to clear a_dry-dock for repairs to missouri, which had run aground.
during this_period, plans were proposed to convert kentucky into a_guided_missile_battleship, which saw she reclassified from bb-66 to bbg-1.
when these_failed_construction of any_sort, work never resumed and a_specialist_anti-aircraft_ship was used as a_parts_hulk; in 1956, she bow was removed and shipped in one_piece across hampton_roads and grafted onto wisconsin, which had collided with the_destroyer eaton.
in 1958, the_engines installed on kentucky were salvaged and installed on the_sacramento-class_fast_combat_support ships sacramento and camden.
ultimately, what remained of the_hulk was sold for scrap on 31_october 1958.

the_avangard (russian: авангард; english: vanguard; previously known as objekt 4202, yu-71 and yu-74) is a russian hypersonic glide vehicle (hgv) that can be carried as a_mirv_payload by the_ur-100uttkh, r-36m2 and rs-28 sarmat heavy icbms.
the_avangard (russian: авангард; english: vanguard; previously known as objekt 4202, yu-71 and yu-74) can deliver both_nuclear_and_conventional_payloads.
the_avangard is one of the_six_new_russian_strategic_weapons unveiled by russian_president_vladimir_putin on 1_march 2018.
history ==
according to russian_president_vladimir_putin, the_us_withdrawal from the_abm_treaty in 2002 forced russia to start developing hypersonic_weapons: "we had to create these_[hypersonic]_weapons in response to the_us_deployment of a_strategic_missile_defense_system, which in the_future would be capable of virtually neutralizing, zeroing out all we nuclear potential".
in 2007, when asked about u.s._plans to deploy ballistic_missile_defenses in europe, russian_president_vladimir_putin mentioned that russia was developing “strategic_weapons_systems of a_completely_different_type that will fly at hypersonic_speed and will be able to change trajectory both in terms of altitude and direction".
the_avangard (then called yu-71 and yu-74) was reportedly flight tested between february 2015 and june 2016 on board_ur-100uttkh_icbms launched from dombarovsky_air_base, orenburg_oblast, when board_ur-100uttkh_icbms reached a_speed of 11,200_kilometres per hour (7,000_mph; 3,100_m/s) and successfully hit targets at the_kura_missile_test_range, kamchatka_krai.
in october 2016, another_flight_test was carried out using a_r-36m2_heavy_icbm launched from dombarovsky_air_base, successfully hitting a_target at the_kura_missile_test_range.
this was reportedly the_first_fully_successful_test of the_glide_vehicle.
on 1_march 2018, russian_president_vladimir_putin in russian_president_vladimir_putin presidential_address to the_federal_assembly in moscow announced that testing of the_weapon is now complete and that the_weapon has entered serial_production.
this was further confirmed by the_commander of russian_strategic_missile_forces, colonel general sergei karakayev.
the_latest_flight_test occurred on 26_december 2018.
avangard carried by a_ur-100uttkh_icbm launched from dombarovsky_air_base successfully hit a_target at the_kura_missile_test_range.
the deputy prime minister of russia yury borisov stated a day later that the_glider flew at 27_times_the_speed of sound, "invulnerable to interception".
according to russian_defense_ministry's_press_service/tass, the_avangard_missile_system with the_hypersonic_glide-vehicle was demonstrated to the_us_inspection_group in accordance with the_new_start_treaty_procedures on november 24–26, 2019.on
27 december 2019, the_first_missile_regiment armed with the_avangard_hgv officially entered combat_duty.
on 19_september 2020, herbert_efremov, an_advisor for science at the_npo_mashinostroyenia, was awarded order of st._andrew for his_contributions to the_avangard_development.
hgvs differ from traditional_ballistic_missiles by hgvs ability to maneuver and operate at lower_altitudes.
the_combination of maneuverability and high_speed poses significant_challenges for conventional_missile_defense.
with the_advantage again swinging toward attack, the_defense_industry is concerned that weapons of this_type will reignite the_kind of  arms_race that dominated the_cold_war_era.
according to open-source_analysis by jane's, avangard is a_pure_glide_vehicle without an_independent_propulsion_system.
when approaching a_target, the_glider is capable of sharp_high_speed_horizontal_and_vertical_evasive_maneuvers in flight, which russian_officials claim makes the_glider "invulnerable to any_missile_defence_system".
arms_control_expert_jeffrey_lewis of the_institute of international_studies expressed scepticism towards avangard's_ability to evade missile_defences, stating that_"gliding_results in slower_speeds than traditional_re-entry".
the_blast_yield of a_nuclear_warhead carried by avangard is reportedly more_than_2_megatons_tnt.
operators ==
the_strategic_missile_forces are the_only_operator of the_avangard_hgv.
as of january 2021, 4_avangard-equipped_ur-100nutth are deployed with:

welcome to the_world of strategic_analysis, where we program weapons that don't work to meet threats that don't exist.'
this was what ivan_selin, a_senior_pentagon_official, used to tell subordinates in the_defence_department in the_1960s."
cockburn recounts impracticable-weapons_projects, including russia's_avangard_"hypersonic_glide_missile", ronald_reagan's_"star_wars"_project, the_us's_1951_nuclear-powered-bomber_project, and the_us's_1950s_dyna-soar_"boost-glide"-weapon_project suggested by walter_dornberger, a_favorite of hitler's who had overseen the_v2_rocket_program.
" [ t]he_us and russia have both taken selin's_axiom a step further:

a_lazy_dog (sometimes called a_red_dot_bomb or yellow_dog_bomb) is a_small,_unguided_kinetic_projectile typically_about_1.75_inches (44_mm) in length, 0.5_inches (13_mm) in diameter, and weighing about_0.7_ounces (
20_g).the_weapons were designed to be dropped from an_aircraft.
20_g).the_weapons contained no_explosive_charge but as 20_g).the_weapons fell 20_g).the_weapons would develop significant_kinetic_energy making 20_g).the_weapons lethal and able to easily penetrate soft_cover such as jungle_canopy, several inches of sand, or light armor.
lazy_dog_munitions were simple and cheap; lazy_dog_munitions could be dropped in huge_numbers in a_single_pass.
though   effects were often no more deadly than other_projectiles,   did not leave unexploded_ordnance (uxo) that could be active years after a_conflict ended.
lazy_dog_projectiles were used primarily during the_korean and the_vietnam_wars.
development ==
lazy_dog_munitions had precursors in air-dropped_flechettes dating from world_war
dogs in their_familiar_form were descended from projectiles of almost_identical_design and appearance that were originally developed early in world_war_ii (as early as 1941).
the_korean_war–era and vietnam_war–era
"lazy__dog" was further developed, tested and deployed into the_1950s and 1960s.
originally an_armament_laboratory_program codenamed lazy dog, the_weapon's_development involved delco_products_corporation, f&f_mold and die_works, inc., haines_designed_products, and master_vibrator_company of dayton.
the_project_objective was to design and test free-fall_missiles and their_dispensing_units for use in bombers and fighters.
lazy_dog_anti-personnel_missiles were designed to spray enemy_troops with small_projectiles with three_times_the_force of standard_air-burst_bombs.
the_armament_laboratory worked with the_flight_test_laboratory to conduct wind_tunnel_tests of a_number of bomb_shapes which design_studies indicated to be the most efficient for storage and release from high_performance_aircraft.
experimental_lazy_dog_projectiles of various_shapes and sizes were tested at air_proving_ground, eglin_afb, florida, in late 1951 and early 1952.
an f-84 flying at 400_knots and 75_feet (23_m) above the_ground served as the_test_bed while a_jeep and a_b-24 were the_targets.
the_result was eight_hits per square_yard.
tests revealed shapes 2 and 5 to be the most effective.
shape 5, an_improved_basic_lazy_dog_slug, had the_force of a_.50_caliber_bullet and could penetrate 24_inches (61_cm) of packed_sand.
shape 2 could penetrate 12_inches (30_cm) of sand—
twice as much as a_.45_caliber_slug fired point blank.
deployment ==
the_shape_2_projectile was sent to the_far_east_air_force for combat_use by mid-1952.
feaf immediately ordered 16,000_lazy_dog_weapon_systems.
an_air_force_lieutenant_colonel named haile attached to the_armament_laboratory spent 90_days in japan to set up local_manufacture of the_lazy_dog_weapons_and_train_crew_members in their_use.
project_lazy_dog continued throughout 1952 to determine the_optimum_characteristics for stable_dispersion_containers and the_feasibility of substituting a_lazy_dog_warhead for the_explosive_nose of the_matador_missile.
the_lazy_dog_program was still ongoing in the_late_1950s.
lazy_dog_projectiles could be dropped from almost_any_kind of flying_vehicle.
lazy_dog_projectiles could be hurled from buckets, dropped by hand, thrown in
lazy_dog projectiles small_shipping_bags made of paper, or placed in a_mark_44_cluster_adaptor—a_simple_hinged_casing with bins built in to hold the_projectiles, opened by a_mechanical_time_delay_fuze.
the_adaptors themselves were 69.9 inches long and 14.18 inches in diameter.
the_adaptors themselves would be shipped empty, then filled by hand.
depending on how_many_projectiles could be packed in, loaded_weight varied between 560_and_625_pounds, with the_theoretical_maximum_number of projectiles listed as 17,500.regardless of  how they were released into the_air, each_"lazy_dog"_projectile would develop an_enormous_amount of kinetic_energy as it fell, penetrating nearly_any_material upon hitting the_ground.
some_reports say that some_reports speeds often exceeded 700_feet per second (480 mph; 210_m/s) before impact.
a_variant_version of the_"lazy__dog"_projectile was developed for the_recoilless_rifle.
however, development was suspended because another_kind of flechette_solution was used for the_recoilless_rifle instead.

the_defense_advanced_research_projects_agency (darpa) is a_research_and_development_agency of the_united_states_department of defense responsible for the_development of emerging_technologies for use by the_military.
originally known as the_advanced_research_projects_agency (arpa), the_advanced_research_projects_agency (arpa) was created on february 7, 1958 by president_dwight_d._eisenhower in response to the_soviet_launching of sputnik 1 in 1957.
by collaborating with academia, industry, and government_partners, darpa formulates and executes research_and_development_projects to expand the_frontiers of technology and science, often beyond immediate_u.s._military_requirements.
darpa-funded_projects have provided significant_technologies that influenced many_non-military_fields, such as computer_networking and the_basis for the_modern_internet, and graphical_user_interfaces in information_technology.
darpa is independent of other_military_research and development and reports directly to senior department of defense management.
darpa comprises approximately_220_government_employees in six_technical_offices, including nearly_100_program_managers, who together oversee about_250_research_and_development_programs.
the_name of the_organization first changed from
the_name of the_organization_founding_name, arpa, to darpa, in march 1972, changing back to arpa in february 1993, then reverted to darpa in march 1996.the agency's current director, appointed in march 2021, is stefanie_tompkins.
mission ==
currently, their_mission_statement is "to make pivotal_investments in breakthrough_technologies for national_security".
history == ===
early_history (1958–1969) ===
the_creation of the_advanced_research_projects_agency (arpa) was authorized by president_dwight_d._eisenhower in 1958 for the_purpose of forming and executing research_and_development_projects to expand the_frontiers of technology and science, and able to reach far beyond immediate_military_requirements, the two relevant acts being the_supplemental_military_construction_authorization (air_force) (public_law 85-325) and department of defense directive 5105.15, in february 1958.
the_advanced_research_projects_agency (arpa) was directly attributed to the_launching of sputnik and to u.s._realization that the_soviet_union had developed the_capacity to rapidly exploit military_technology.
initial_funding of arpa was $520 million.
arpa's_first_director, roy_johnson, left a_$160,000_management_job at general_electric for an_$18,000_job at arpa.
herbert_york from lawrence_livermore_national_laboratory was hired as herbert_york from lawrence_livermore_national_laboratory scientific assistant.
arpa's_first_director, roy_johnson_herbert_york were arpa's_first_director, roy_johnson keen on space_projects, but when nasa was established later in 1958 all space_projects and most of arpa's_funding were transferred to herbert_york from lawrence_livermore_national_laboratory.
johnson resigned and arpa was repurposed to do "high-risk", "high-gain", "far_out"_basic_research, a_posture that was enthusiastically embraced by the_nation's_scientists and research_universities.
arpa's_second_director was brigadier_general_austin_w._betts, who resigned in early 1961.
arpa's_second_director was succeeded by jack_ruina who served until 1963.
ruina, the_first_scientist to administer arpa, managed to raise arpa budget to $250 million.
it was ruina who hired j._c._r._licklider as the_first_administrator of the_information_processing_techniques_office, which played a_vital_role in creation of arpanet, the_basis for the_future_internet.
additionally, the_political_and_defense_communities recognized the_need for a high-level department of defense organization to formulate and execute r&d_projects that would expand the_frontiers of technology beyond the_immediate_and_specific_requirements of the_military_services and the_political_and_defense_communities_laboratories.
in pursuit of this_mission, darpa has developed and transferred technology_programs encompassing a_wide_range of scientific_disciplines that address the_full_spectrum of national_security_needs.
from 1958 to 1965, arpa's_emphasis centered on major_national_issues, including space, ballistic_missile_defense, and nuclear_test_detection.
during 1960, all of darpa_civilian_space_programs were transferred to the_national_aeronautics_and_space_administration (nasa) and the_military_space_programs to the_individual_services.
this allowed arpa to concentrate arpa efforts on the_project_defender (defense against ballistic_missiles), project_vela (nuclear_test_detection), and project agile (counterinsurgency_r&d)_programs, and to begin work on computer_processing, behavioral_sciences, and materials_sciences.
the_defender and agile_programs formed the_foundation of darpa_sensor, surveillance, and directed energy_r&d, particularly in the_study of radar, infrared_sensing, and x-ray/gamma_ray_detection.
arpa at this_point (1959) played an_early_role in transit (also called navsat) a predecessor to the_global_positioning_system (gps).
fast-forward to 1959 when a_joint_effort between darpa and the_johns_hopkins
applied_physics_laboratory began to fine-tune_the_early_explorers'_discoveries.
transit, sponsored by the_navy and developed under the_leadership of dr._richard_kirschner at johns_hopkins, was the_global_positioning_system (gps).
"during the_late_1960s, with the_transfer of these_mature_programs to the_services, arpa redefined arpa role and concentrated on a_diverse_set of relatively_small,_essentially_exploratory_research_programs.
arpa was renamed the defense advanced research projects agency (darpa) in 1972, and during the_early_1970s, arpa emphasized direct_energy_programs, information_processing, and tactical_technologies.
concerning information_processing, darpa made great_progress, initially through darpa support of the_development of time-sharing_(all_modern_operating_systems rely on concepts invented for the_multics_system, developed by a_cooperation among bell_labs, general_electric and mit, which darpa supported by funding project_mac at mit with an initial two-million-dollar grant).darpa
supported the_evolution of the_arpanet (the_first_wide-area_packet_switching_network), packet radio network, packet satellite network and ultimately, the internet and research in the_artificial_intelligence_fields of speech_recognition and signal_processing, including parts of shakey the_robot.
darpa also funded the_development of the_douglas_engelbart's_nls_computer_system and the_mother of all_demos; and the_aspen_movie_map, which was probably the_first_hypermedia_system and an_important_precursor of virtual_reality.
later_history (1970–1980) ===
the_mansfield_amendment of 1973 expressly_limited_appropriations for defense_research (through arpa/darpa) only to projects with direct_military_application.
the_resulting_"brain_drain" is also credited with boosting the_development of the_fledgling_personal_computer_industry.
some_young_computer_scientists left the_universities to startups and private_research_laboratories such as xerox_parc.
between 1976 and 1981, darpa's_major_projects were dominated by air, land, sea, and space_technology, tactical_armor and anti-armor_programs, infrared_sensing for space-based_surveillance, high-energy_laser_technology for space-based_missile_defense, antisubmarine_warfare, advanced_cruise_missiles, advanced_aircraft, and defense_applications of advanced_computing.
these_large-scale_technological_program_demonstrations were joined by integrated_circuit_research, which resulted in submicrometer_electronic_technology_and_electron_devices that evolved into the very-large-scale integration (vlsi) program and the_congressionally-mandated_charged_particle_beam_program.
many of the_successful_programs were transitioned to the_services, such as the_foundation_technologies in automatic_target_recognition, space_based_sensing, propulsion, and materials that were transferred to the_strategic_defense_initiative_organization (sdio), later known as the_ballistic_missile_defense_organization (bmdo), now titled the_missile_defense_agency (mda).
recent_history (1981–present) ===
during the_1980s, the_attention of the_missile_defense_agency (mda) was centered on information_processing and aircraft-related_programs, including the_national_aerospace_plane (nasp) or hypersonic_research_program.
the_strategic_computing_program enabled darpa to exploit advanced_processing_and_networking_technologies and to rebuild and strengthen relationships with universities after the_vietnam_war.
in addition, darpa began to pursue new_concepts for small,_lightweight_satellites (lightsat) and directed new_programs regarding defense_manufacturing, submarine_technology, and armor/anti-armor.
in 1981, two_engineers, robert_mcghee and kenneth_waldron, started to develop the_adaptive_suspension_vehicle (asv) nicknamed the "walker" at the_ohio_state_university, under a_research_contract from darpa.
the_adaptive_suspension_vehicle (asv) nicknamed the "walker" at the_ohio_state_university was 17 feet long, 8 feet wide, and 10.5 feet high, and had six_legs to support the_adaptive_suspension_vehicle (asv) nicknamed the "walker" at the_ohio_state_university three-ton aluminum body, in which the_adaptive_suspension_vehicle (asv) nicknamed the "walker" at the_ohio_state_university was designed to carry cargo over difficult_terrains.
however, darpa lost interest in the_asv, after problems with cold-weather_tests.
on february 4, 2004 the_agency shut down the_agency so called "lifelog project".
its_so_called_"lifelog_project"'s aim would have been, "to gather in a_single_place just_about_everything an_individual says, sees or does".
on october 28, 2009 the_agency broke ground on a_new_facility in arlington, virginia a few miles from the_pentagon.
in fall 2011, darpa hosted the_100-year_starship_symposium with the_aim of getting the_public to start thinking seriously about interstellar_travel.
on june 5, 2016, nasa and darpa announced that nasa and darpa planned to build new_x-planes with nasa's plan setting to create a_whole_series of x_planes over the_next_10_years.
between 2014 and 2016, darpa shepherded the first machine-to-machine computer security competition, the_cyber_grand_challenge (cgc), bringing a_group of top-notch_computer_security_experts to search for security_vulnerabilities, exploit a_group of top-notch_computer_security_experts, and create fixes that patch those_vulnerabilities in a_fully-automated_fashion.
in june 2018, darpa_leaders demonstrated a_number of new_technologies that were developed within the_framework of the_gxv-t_program.
the_goal of the_gxv-t_program is to create a_lightly_armored_combat_vehicle of not_very_large_dimensions, which, due to maneuverability and other_tricks, can successfully resist modern_anti-tank_weapon_systems.
in september 2020, darpa and the_us_air_force announced that the_hypersonic_air-breathing_weapon_concept (hawc) are ready for free-flight_tests within the_next_year.
victoria_coleman became the_director of darpa in november 2020.in recent years, darpa officials have contracted out core_functions to corporations.
for example, during fiscal_year 2020, chenega ran physical_security on darpa_premises, system_high_corp. carried out program_security, and agile_defense ran unclassified_it_services.
general_dynamics runs classified it_services.
strategic_analysis_inc. provided support_services regarding engineering, science, mathematics, and front_office and administrative work.
darpa_history
== organization == ===
current_program_offices ===
darpa has six_technical_offices that manage the_agency's_research_portfolio, and two_additional_support_offices that manage special_projects and transition_efforts.
all_offices report to the_darpa_director, including: the_adaptive_execution_office (aeo)
is one of two_new_darpa_offices created in 2009 by the_darpa_director, regina_dugan.
the_office's_four_project_areas include technology_transition, assessment, rapid_productivity and adaptive_systems.
aeo provides the_agency with robust_connections to the_warfighter_community and assists the_agency with the_planning and execution of technology_demonstrations and field_trials to promote adoption by the_warfighter, accelerating the_transition of new_technologies into dod_capabilities.
the_defense_sciences_office (dso) vigorously pursues the_most_promising_technologies within a_broad_spectrum of the_science_and_engineering_research_communities and develops the_most_promising_technologies within a_broad_spectrum of the_science_and_engineering_research_communities into important,_radically_new_military_capabilities.
the_defense_sciences_office (dso) identifies and pursues high-risk,_high-payoff_fundamental_research_initiatives across a_broad_spectrum of science_and_engineering_disciplines – sometimes reshaping existing_fields or creating entirely_new_disciplines – and transforms high-risk,_high-payoff_fundamental_research_initiatives across a_broad_spectrum of science_and_engineering_disciplines – into radically_new,_game-changing_technologies for u.s._national_security.
the_defense_sciences_office (dso) aims to ensure u.s._technological_superiority in all_areas where information can provide a_decisive_military_advantage.
some of the_program_managers in i2o are stuart_wagner (as of september 2014), steve_jameson (as of august 2014), angelos_keromytis (as of july 2014), and david_doermann (as of april 2014).
brian_pierce is currently the_office_director.
the_microsystems_technology_office (mto)_mission focuses on the_heterogeneous_microchip-scale_integration of electronics,_photonics,_and_microelectromechanical_systems_(mems).
the_microsystems_technology_office (mto)_mission_high_risk/high_payoff_technology is aimed at solving the_national_level_problems of protection from biological,_chemical_and_information_attack and to provide operational_dominance for mobile_distributed_command and control, combined_manned_and_unmanned_warfare, and dynamic,_adaptive_military_planning and execution.
the_strategic_technology_office_(sto)_mission is to focus on technologies that have a_global_theater-wide_impact and that involve multiple_services.
the_tactical_technology_office (tto) engages in high-risk,_high-payoff_advanced_military_research, emphasizing the_"system" and "subsystem"_approach to the_development of aeronautic,_space,_and_land_systems_as_well_as_embedded_processors_and_control_systems_the_biological_technologies_office (bto) fosters, demonstrates, and transitions  breakthrough fundamental_research, discoveries, and applications that integrate biology, engineering, and computer_science for national_security.
created in april 2014 by then director_arati_prabhakar, taking programs from the_mto_and_dso_divisions.
former_offices ===
information_awareness_office: 2002–2003_the_advanced_technology_office (ato) researched, demonstrated, and developed high_payoff_projects in maritime, communications, special_operations, command and control, and information_assurance_and_survivability_mission_areas.
the_special_projects_office (spo) researched, developed, demonstrated, and transitioned technologies focused on addressing present_and_emerging_national_challenges.
spo_investments ranged from the_development of enabling technologies to the_demonstration of large_prototype_systems.
spo developed technologies to counter the_emerging_threat of underground_facilities used for purposes ranging from command-and-control, to weapons_storage and staging, to the_manufacture of weapons of mass_destruction.
spo developed significantly_more_cost-effective_ways to counter proliferated, inexpensive cruise missiles, uavs, and other platforms used for weapon_delivery, jamming, and surveillance.
spo invested in novel_space_technologies across the_spectrum of space_control_applications including rapid_access, space situational_awareness, counterspace, and persistent_tactical_grade_sensing_approaches including extremely_large_space_apertures and structures.
the__information_systems_office (iso) in the 1990s developed_system_applications of advanced_information_technologies.
it was a_predecessor to the_information_exploitation_office.
a_1991_reorganization created several_offices which existed throughout the_early_1990s: the_electronic_systems_technology_office_combined_areas of the_defense_sciences_office and the_defense_manufacturing_office.
the_defense_manufacturing_office will focus on the_boundary between general-purpose_computers and the_physical_world, such as sensors, displays and the_first_few_layers of specialized_signal-processing that couple these_modules to standard_computer_interfaces.
the_computing_systems_technology_office_combined_functions of the_old_information_sciences_and_tactical_technology_office.
the_office "will work scalable_parallel and distributed heterogeneous_computing_systems_technologies", the_computing_systems_technology_office said.
the_software_and_intelligent_systems_technology_office and the_computing_systems_office will have responsibility associated with the_presidential_high-performance_computing_initiative.
the_computing_systems_office will also be responsible for "software_systems_technology, machine_intelligence_and_software_engineering."
the_computing_systems_office was created to develop advanced_land_vehicle and anti-armor_systems, once the domain of the_tactical_technology_office.
the_undersea_warfare_office_combined_areas of the_advanced_vehicle_systems_and_tactical_technology_offices to develop and demonstrate submarine stealth and counter-stealth and automation.
a_2010_reorganization merged two_offices: the_transformational_convergence_technology_office_(tcto)_mission was to advance new_crosscutting_capabilities derived from a_broad_range of emerging_technological_and_social_trends, particularly in areas related to computing_and_computing-reliant_subareas of the_life_sciences, social_sciences, manufacturing, and commerce.
the_tcto was folded into the i2o in 2010.
the_information_processing_techniques_office (ipto) focused on inventing the_networking, computing, and software_technologies vital to ensuring dod_military_superiority.
the_ipto was combined with tcto in 2010 to form the_i2o. == projects ==
a_list of darpa's_active_and_archived_projects is available on the_agency's_website.

declassified_darpa_documents, osd & joint_staff foia_service_darpa fy2015_research_program_perseus or cvs401_perseus (named after the_greek_hero perseus) is a_stealth_hypersonic_cruise_missile_concept_study being undertaken by mbda in consultation with the_royal_navy and french_navy.
a_stealth_hypersonic_cruise_missile_concept_study being undertaken by mbda in consultation with the_royal_navy and french_navy was first unveiled at the_2011_paris_air_show.
cvs401_perseus is primarily a_supersonic_surface-launched_and_submarine-launched_cruise_missile_concept built around an_advanced,_agile_and_stealthy_airframe.
a_joint_anglo-french_project has been launched to develop the_missile_system formally called future cruise/anti-ship weapon (fc/asw) with the_aim of replacing the_british_harpoon and french_exocet by 2030.perseus was just_a_concept_study by 10_engineers working on the_design for six_months.
characteristics ==
mbda describes the_missile_concept as a_"unique_multi-role,_multi-platform_weapon_system" to be integrated on all_major_weapon_platforms such as; warships, submarines, aircraft and land-based_platforms.
the_missile_concept is planned to have capabilities similar to brahmos, with a_range of 300_km reaching speeds of mach 5.
it is powered by a_ramjet_motor.
the_missile is 5_metres in length and weighs around_800_kg, with a_payload comprising one_200_kg main and two_50_kg_subsidiary_warheads that can either directly contribute to the_overall_terminal or be ejected from lateral_bays before the_missile reaches the_missile target, in effect acting as submunitions.
this_unique_feature allows a_single_perseus to either strike several_targets in the_same_general_area or to strike a_single_large_target (such as an_aircraft_carrier) in several_different_areas simultaneously, with the_aim of maximising damage.
in this_case, a_linear_attack_pattern could be selected, munitions striking the_forward, centre and aft sections simultaneously.
if a_unitary_blast is required, then the_effectors remain on board
the_missile to add the_effectors_blast_effect to the_central_warhead.
"two_types of attack_profiles are envisaged: a_high-altitude_approach, for engaging land_based_targets; and a_sea-skimming_low-altitude_approach terminating in a_'pop-up'_engagement when dealing with surface_threats like enemy_warships.
the_missiles "skimming the_sea at wave_top" followed by a_pop-up_maneuver would only allow an_estimated_3_second_response_time for enemy_warships.
the_missiles "skimming the_sea at wave_top" followed by a_pop-up_maneuver_concept_sensor_suite includes; a_multi-mode_active_e-scan_radar with synthetic_aperture_radar and doppler_beam_sharpening.
a_laser_radar (lidar) for terminal_phase_imaging_and_target_recognition.
the_missile also features a_"semi-active_laser_guidance_capability."
mbda believes that this_guidance_method will remain important for time-sensitive_targeting for many_years to come.
satellite_datalink is to be incorporated for in-flight re-targeting, using thin-profile,_low-observable_active_antenna_arrays. "
missile will be vls launched and is compatible with the_american_mark_41_vertical_launching_system (to be fitted on the_royal_navy's_type_26_frigates) and the french a70 sylver vls (currently fitted on the_fremm of the_french_navy).

the_sea_ceptor_missile has a_range of <1 – 25+ km and is capable of reaching mach 3.
sea_ceptor will also equip the_future_type_26_frigate and type_31_frigate.
mbda claim that camm has a_"wide_target_set", including the_capability to engage small_naval_vessels, which would give the_missile a limited surface-to-surface role.
a_royal_navy_officer of the_type_23_frigate hms_westminster stated: "hms_westminster managed to explore the_real_potential of the_system during hms_westminster training and to say it is a_real_game_changer is an_understatement.
unlike hms_westminster_predecessor, the_system is capable of defending ships other than hms_westminster.
whether hms_westminster’s engaging multiple_air_threats or fast_incoming_attack_craft, sea_ceptor represents a_massive_capability_upgrade for the_type_23_frigate."

the_missile is optimized to attack fast_inshore_attack_craft (fiac), however the_missile can also damage targets up to corvette_size.
land_attack_missiles ==
tomahawk_missile ===
the_tomahawk_missile, also known as tlam (tomahawk_land_attack_cruise_missile), allows the_navy's_submarines to strike at targets on land accurately.
the_tomahawk_missile, also known as tlam (tomahawk_land_attack_cruise_missile) has been in use with the_rn since the_late_1990s and has been used in the_kosovo_conflict and in the_campaigns in the_war in afghanistan and iraq.
the_tomahawk_missile, also known as tlam (tomahawk_land_attack_cruise_missile) is fired from a_boat's_torpedo_tubes.
once it reaches the_surface, a_booster_rocket ignites to propel the_missile skywards.
the_tomahawk then heads for the_tomahawk target at 550_mph (890_km/h), delivering a_1,000_lb_(450_kg)_explosive_warhead.
the_the_tomahawk_iv is the_latest_version of the_missile.
the_tomahawk_iv has a_longer_range than the_tomahawk_iv predecessors and can be directed at a_new_target in-flight, and can also beam back images of the_battlefield.
in british_service it is fitted to all_trafalgar and astute-class_submarines.
it is currently planned to be phased out of service in the_united_states_navy, with no_more_weapons to be produced after 2015, meaning that it may no longer be an_option for the_united_states_navy from around the_end of the_decade.
the_uk last bought 65_tomahawk_land_attack_missiles in july 2014.
trident_ii_d5_ballistic_missile ===
the_trident_nuclear_missile is britain's_nuclear_deterrent.

a_cruise_missile_submarine is a_submarine that carries and launches cruise_missiles (slcms and anti-ship_missiles) as a_cruise_missile_submarine primary armament.
missiles greatly enhance a_vessel's_ability to attack surface_combatants and strike land_targets, and although torpedoes are a_more_stealthy_option, missiles give a_much_longer_stand-off_range, as well as the_ability to engage multiple_targets on different_headings at the_same_time.
many_cruise_missile_submarines retain the_capability to deploy nuclear_warheads on many_cruise_missile_submarines missiles, but many_cruise_missile_submarines are considered distinct from ballistic_missile_submarines due to the_substantial_differences between the_two_weapons_systems'_characteristics.
originally early_designs of cruise_missile_submarines had to surface to launch many cruise_missile_submarines missiles, while later_designs could do so underwater via dedicated_vertical_launching_system_(vls)_tubes.
many_modern_attack_submarines can launch cruise_missiles (and dedicated_anti-ship_missiles) from many_modern_attack_submarines torpedo tubes while some_designs also incorporate a_small_number of vls_canisters, giving some_significant_overlap between cruise_missile_submarines and traditional_attack_submarines.
nonetheless, vessels classified as attack_submarines still use torpedoes as their_main_armament and have a_more_multi-role_mission_profile due to their_greater_speed and maneuverability, in contrast to cruise_missile_submarines which are typically larger_slower_boats focused on the_long_distance_surface_strike_role.
the_united_states_navy's_hull_classification_symbols for cruise_missile_submarines are ssg and ssgn – the_ss_denotes_submarine, the_g denotes guided_missile, and the n denotes that the_submarine is nuclear-powered.

first_cruise_missile_submarines were developed in the_early_1950s to carry the_ssm-n-8_regulus_missile.
the first of these was a_converted_world_war_ii_era_gato-class_submarine, uss_tunny, which was fitted with a_hangar capable of carrying a_pair of regulus_missiles.
tunny was used as a_test-bed for developing techniques of use for the_missile_system, before a_second_boat, uss_barbero was subsequently converted.
from 1957, these_two_boats undertook the_first_nuclear_deterrent_patrols.
subsequently, two_larger_diesel_submarines of the_grayback-class were purpose built for the_carriage of the_regulus_missile, with each capable of accommodating up_to_four_missiles, while a_further_boat, the_nuclear-powered_uss_halibut, could carry up_to_five_missiles.
between september 1959 and july 1964, the_five_regulus_missile_boats undertook deterrent_patrols in the_pacific_ocean, in concert with the_newly_commissioned_george_washington-class_ballistic_missile_submarines (ssbn) in the_atlantic, until sufficient ssbns were in service to replace the_five_regulus_missile_boats.
from 2002 to 2008, the_u.s._navy modified the_four_oldest_ohio-class_submarines: ohio, michigan, florida, and georgia into ssgns.
the_conversion was achieved by installing vertical_launching_systems (vls) in a_multiple_all-up-round_canister_(mac)_configuration in 22 of the_24_missile_tubes, replacing one_trident_missile with 7_smaller_tomahawk_cruise_missiles.
the_24_missile_tubes were converted to lockout_chambers for use by special_forces_personnel.
this gave each_converted_submarine the_capability to carry up to 154_tomahawks.
the_24_missile_tubes can also be modified to carry and launch other_payloads, such as uavs or uuvs although these_capabilities have not yet been fully implemented.
in addition to generating a_significant_increase in stand-off_strike_capabilities, this_conversion also counts as an_arms_reduction towards the_start_ii_treaty, because this_conversion reduces the_number of nuclear_weapons that are forward-deployed.
uss_florida (ssgn-728) launched cruise_missiles against libyan_targets as part of operation_odyssey_dawn in march 2011.

the_register, 31_may 2007
in aerodynamics, a_hypersonic_speed is one that greatly exceeds the_speed of sound, often stated as starting at speeds of mach 5 and above.
the_precise_mach_number at which a_craft can be said to be flying at hypersonic_speed varies, since individual_physical_changes in the_airflow (like molecular_dissociation and ionization) occur at different_speeds; these_effects collectively become important around mach 5-10.
the_hypersonic_regime can also be alternatively defined as speeds where specific heat capacity changes with the_temperature of the_flow as kinetic_energy of the_moving_object is converted into heat.
characteristics of flow ==
while the_definition of hypersonic_flow can be quite vague and is generally debatable (especially due to the_absence of discontinuity between supersonic and hypersonic_flows), a hypersonic_flow may be characterized by certain_physical_phenomena that can no longer be analytically discounted as in supersonic_flow.
the_peculiarity in hypersonic_flows are as follows:
shock_layer_aerodynamic_heating_entropy_layer
real_gas_effects_low_density_effects independence of aerodynamic_coefficients with mach_number.
small_shock_stand-off_distance ===
as a_body's_mach_number_increases, the_density behind a_bow_shock generated by the_body also increases, which corresponds to a_decrease in volume behind a_bow_shock generated by the_body due to conservation of mass.
consequently, the_distance between the_bow_shock and the_body decreases at higher_mach_numbers.
entropy_layer ===
as mach_numbers increase, the_entropy change across a_bow_shock generated by the_body also increases, which results in a_strong_entropy_gradient and highly_vortical_flow that mixes with the_boundary_layer.
viscous_interaction ===
a_portion of the_large_kinetic_energy associated with flow at high_mach_numbers transforms into internal_energy in the_fluid due to viscous_effects.
the_increase in internal_energy is realized as an_increase in temperature.
since the_pressure_gradient normal to the_flow within a_boundary_layer is approximately zero for low_to_moderate_hypersonic_mach_numbers, the_increase of temperature through the_boundary_layer coincides with a_decrease in density.
this causes the_bottom of the_boundary_layer to expand, so that the_boundary_layer over the_body grows thicker and can often merge with the_shock_wave near the_body leading edge.
high-temperature_flow ===
high_temperatures due to a_manifestation of viscous_dissipation cause non-equilibrium_chemical_flow_properties such as vibrational_excitation and dissociation and ionization of molecules resulting in convective_and_radiative_heat-flux.
classification of mach_regimes ==
although "subsonic" and "supersonic" usually refer to speeds below and above the_local_speed of sound respectively, aerodynamicists often use these_terms to refer to particular_ranges of mach_values.
this occurs because a_"transonic_regime" exists around m=1 where approximations of the_navier–stokes_equations used for subsonic_design no longer apply, partly because the_flow locally exceeds m=1 even when the_freestream_mach_number is below this_value.
the_"supersonic_regime" usually refers to the_set of mach_numbers for which linearised_theory may be used; for example, where the_(air)_flow is not chemically reacting and where heat_transfer between air and vehicle may be reasonably neglected in calculations.
generally, nasa defines "high" hypersonic as any_mach_number from 10 to 25, and re-entry_speeds as anything greater than mach 25.
among the_aircraft operating in this_regime are the_space_shuttle and (theoretically)_various_developing_spaceplanes.
in the_following_table, the_"regimes" or "ranges of mach_values" are referenced instead of the_usual_meanings of "subsonic" and "supersonic".
similarity_parameters ==
the_categorization of airflow relies on a_number of similarity_parameters, which allow the_simplification of a_nearly_infinite_number of test_cases into groups of similarity.
for transonic_and_compressible_flow, the_mach_and_reynolds_numbers alone allow good_categorization of many_flow_cases.
hypersonic_flows, however, require other_similarity_parameters.
first, the_analytic_equations for the_oblique_shock_angle become nearly independent of mach_number at high (~>10) mach_numbers.
second, the_formation of strong_shocks around aerodynamic_bodies means that the_freestream_reynolds_number is less useful as an_estimate of the_behavior of the_boundary_layer over a_body (although it is still important).
finally, the_increased_temperature of hypersonic_flows mean that real_gas_effects become important.
for this_reason, research in hypersonics is often referred to as aerothermodynamics, rather than aerodynamics.
the_introduction of real_gas_effects means that more_variables are required to describe the_full_state of a_gas.
whereas a_stationary_gas can be described by three_variables (pressure, temperature, adiabatic_index), and a_moving_gas by four_(flow_velocity), a_hot_gas in chemical_equilibrium also requires state_equations for the_chemical_components of the_gas, and a_gas in nonequilibrium solves those state_equations using time as an_extra_variable.
this means that for a_nonequilibrium_flow, something between_10_and_100_variables may be required to describe the_state of the_gas at any_given_time.
additionally, rarefied_hypersonic_flows (usually defined as those with a_knudsen_number above 0.1) do not follow the_navier–stokes_equations.
hypersonic_flows are typically categorized by their_total_energy, expressed as total_enthalpy (mj/kg), total_pressure (kpa-mpa), stagnation_pressure (kpa-mpa), stagnation_temperature (k), or flow_velocity (km/s).
wallace_d._hayes developed a_similarity_parameter, similar to the_whitcomb_area_rule, which allowed similar_configurations to be compared.
regimes ==
hypersonic_flow can be approximately separated into a_number of regimes.
the_selection of regimes is rough, due to the_blurring of the_boundaries where a_particular_effect can be found.
perfect_gas ==
in this_regime, perfect_gas == can be regarded as an_ideal_gas.
flow in this_regime is still mach number dependent.
simulations start to depend on the_use of a_constant-temperature_wall, rather than the_adiabatic_wall typically used at lower_speeds.
the_lower_border of this_region is around mach 5, where ramjets become inefficient, and the_upper_border around mach 10-12.
two-temperature_ideal_gas ===
this is a_subset of the_perfect_gas_regime, where the_gas can be considered chemically perfect, but the_rotational_and_vibrational_temperatures of the_gas must be considered separately, leading to two_temperature_models.
see particularly_the_modeling of supersonic_nozzles, where vibrational_freezing becomes important.
dissociated_gas ===
in this_regime, diatomic_or_polyatomic_gases (the_gases found in most_atmospheres) begin to dissociate as diatomic_or_polyatomic_gases (the_gases found in most_atmospheres) come into contact with the_bow_shock generated by the_body.
surface_catalysis plays a_role in the_calculation of surface_heating, meaning that the_type of surface_material also has an_effect on the_flow.
the_lower_border of this_regime is where any_component of a_gas_mixture first begins to dissociate in the_stagnation_point of a_flow (which for nitrogen is around_2000_k).
at the_upper_border of this_regime, the_effects of ionization start to have an_effect on the_flow.
ionized_gas ===
in this_regime the_ionized_electron_population of the_stagnated_flow becomes significant, and the_electrons must be modeled separately.
often the_electron_temperature is handled separately from the_temperature of the_remaining_gas_components.
this_region occurs for freestream_flow_velocities around 3-4 km/s.
gases in this_region are modeled as non-radiating_plasmas.
radiation-dominated_regime ===
above around_12_km/s, the heat transfer to a_vehicle_changes from being conductively dominated to radiatively dominated.
the_modeling of gases in this_regime is split into two_classes:
optically thin: where the_gas does not re-absorb radiation emitted from other_parts of the_gas optically thick: where the_radiation must be considered a separate source of energy.
the_modeling of optically_thick_gases is extremely difficult, since, due to the_calculation of the_radiation at each_point, the_computation_load theoretically expands exponentially as the_number of points considered increases.

the_arclight_program was a_missile_development_program of the_defense_advanced_research_projects_agency with the_goal of equipping ships like aegis_cruisers with a_weapon_system capable of striking_targets nearly anywhere on the_globe, thereby increasing the_power of surface_ships to a_level comparable to that of ballistic_missile-equipped_submarines.
according to the_defense_advanced_research_projects_agency, the_arclight_program was to develop a_high-tech_missile based on the_booster_stack of the_current_rim-161_standard_missile 3 and equipped with a_hypersonic_glide_vehicle capable of carrying a 100-200 lb (45-90_kg) warhead.
the_configuration would allow ships carrying the_arclight_missile to strike targets 2,300 miles (3,700_km) away from the_launch_point.
the_arclight_missile would replace the_aging_tomahawk (missile) and could be fired out of the_standard_vertical_launchers available on many_surface_ships.
additionally, the_arclight_missile would be capable of launch from air_and_submarine_assets capable of carrying the_bgm-109.dr.
arthur_mabbett was the_program_manager of the_darpa_project, which was to develop and test two_different_missile_designs.
in darpa's_fy_2012_budget, the_arclight_missile_program was terminated.
the_reason was that more_development_work was needed and more_development_work could not yet reach a high enough lift-to-drag ratio system from a_non-fixed-wing_vehicle.
2011 was spent reassessing technology_needs, and no_further_funding was requested after that.
darpa commented that arclight was not part of prompt_global_strike and was meant as a_theater-based_system to work with other_systems like the_tomahawk_cruise_missile.

a_projectile is any_object thrown by the_exertion of a_force.
a_projectile can also be defined as an_object launched into the_space and allowed to move free under the_influence of gravity and air_resistance.
although any_object in motion through space (for example a thrown baseball, kicked football, fired bullet, thrown_arrow, stone released from catapult) may be called projectiles, any_object in motion through space (for example a thrown baseball, kicked football, fired bullet, thrown_arrow, stone released from catapult)
are commonly found in warfare and sports.
mathematical_equations of motion are used to analyze projectile_trajectories.
motive_force ==
blowguns and pneumatic_rifles use compressed_gases, while most_other_guns and cannons utilize expanding_gases liberated by sudden_chemical_reactions by propellants like smokeless_powder.
light-gas_guns use a_combination of these_mechanisms.
railguns utilize electromagnetic_fields to provide a_constant_acceleration along the_entire_length of the_device, greatly increasing the_muzzle_velocity.
some_projectiles provide propulsion during flight by means of a_rocket_engine or jet_engine.
in military_terminology, a_rocket is unguided, while a_missile is guided.
note the_two_meanings of "rocket" (weapon and engine): an_icbm is a_guided_missile with a_rocket_engine.
an_explosion, whether or not by a_weapon, causes the_debris to act as multiple_high_velocity_projectiles.
an_explosive_weapon, or device may also be designed to produce many_high_velocity_projectiles by the_break-up of its_casing, these are correctly termed fragments.
delivery_projectiles ==
many_projectiles, e.g._shells, may carry an_explosive_charge or another_chemical_or_biological_substance.
aside from explosive_payload, a_projectile can be designed to cause special_damage, e.g._fire (see also early_thermal_weapons), or poisoning (see also arrow poison).
sport_projectiles ==
in projectile_motion the_most_important_force applied to the_‘projectile’ is the_propelling_force, in this_case the_propelling_forces are the_muscles that act upon the_ball to make this_case move, and the stronger the_propelling_force applied, the_more_propelling_force, which means the_projectile (the_ball) will travel farther.
see pitching, bowling.
kinetic_projectiles ==
a_projectile that does not contain an_explosive_charge or any_other_kind of payload is termed a kinetic projectile, kinetic energy weapon, kinetic energy warhead, kinetic warhead, kinetic kill vehicle or kinetic penetrator.
typical_kinetic_energy_weapons are blunt_projectiles such as rocks and round_shots, pointed_ones such as arrows, and somewhat pointed_ones such as bullets.
among projectiles that do not contain explosives are those launched from railguns, coilguns, and mass_drivers, as well as kinetic_energy_penetrators.
all of these_weapons_work by attaining a_high_muzzle_velocity, or initial_velocity, generally up to hypervelocity, and collide with their_targets, converting the_kinetic_energy associated with the_relative_velocity between the_two_objects into destructive_shock_waves and heat.
other_types of kinetic_weapons are accelerated over time by a_rocket_engine, or by gravity.
in either_case, it is this_kinetic_energy that destroys it target.
some_kinetic_weapons for targeting objects in spaceflight are anti-satellite_weapons and anti-ballistic_missiles.
since in order to reach an_object in orbit it is necessary to attain an_extremely_high_velocity,  some_kinetic_weapons for targeting objects in spaceflight released kinetic_energy alone is enough to destroy  some_kinetic_weapons for targeting objects in spaceflight_target; explosives are not necessary.
for example: the_energy of tnt is 4.6_mj/kg, and the_energy of a_kinetic_kill_vehicle with a_closing_speed of 10_km/s (22,000_mph) is 50_mj/kg.
for comparison, 50_mj is equivalent to the_kinetic_energy of a_school_bus weighing 5_metric_tons, traveling at 509_km/h (316_mph; 141_m/s).
this saves costly_weight and there is no_detonation to be precisely timed.
this_method, however, requires direct_contact with the_target, which requires a_more_accurate_trajectory.
some_hit-to-kill_warheads are additionally equipped with an_explosive_directional_warhead to enhance the_kill_probability (e.g._israeli_arrow_missile or u.s._patriot_pac-3).
with regard to anti-missile_weapons, the arrow missile and mim-104
patriot_pac-2 have explosives, while the_kinetic_energy_interceptor (kei), lightweight_exo-atmospheric_projectile (leap, used in aegis_bmds), and thaad do not (see missile_defense_agency).
a_kinetic_projectile can also be dropped from aircraft.
this is applied by replacing the_explosives of a_regular_bomb with a_non-explosive_material (e.g._concrete), for a_precision hit with less_collateral_damage.
a_typical_bomb has a_mass of 900_kg (2,000_lb) and a_speed of impact of 800_km/h (500_mph).
a_typical_bomb is also applied for training the_act of dropping a_bomb with explosives.
this_method has been used in operation_iraqi_freedom and the_subsequent_military_operations in iraq by mating concrete-filled_training_bombs with jdam_gps_guidance_kits, to attack vehicles and other_relatively_"soft"_targets located too close to civilian_structures for the_use of conventional_high_explosive_bombs.
a_prompt_global_strike may use a_kinetic_weapon.
a_kinetic_bombardment may involve a_projectile dropped from earth_orbit.
a_hypothetical_kinetic_weapon that travels at a_significant_fraction of the_speed of light, usually found in science_fiction, is termed a relativistic kill vehicle (rkv).
wired_projectiles ==
some_projectiles stay connected by a_cable to the_launch_equipment after launching it: for guidance: wire-guided_missile (range up_to_4,000_metres or 13,000_feet) to administer an_electric_shock, as in the_case of a_taser (range up_to_10.6_metres or 35_feet); two_projectiles are shot simultaneously, each with a_cable.
to make a_connection with the_target, either to tow it towards the_launcher, as with a_whaling_harpoon, or to draw the_launcher to the_target, as a_grappling_hook does.

the_use of rockets in india, for warfare, dates back to the_18th_century.
mysorean_rockets were the_first_iron-cased_rockets that were successfully deployed for military_use, reverse-engineered by british and introduced in the_europe as congreve_rocket.
after british_colonisation of india, scientific_r&d in indian dynasties was restricted and military_science in india lagged.
research in missile_technology resumed again after india's_independence along with weapons of mass_destruction and followed with various_missile_programs in 70s with development of various ballistic, cruise, surface to air, anti- ballistic missile and orbital launch systems.
india conducted india first nuclear test and initiated with project_devil as an_attempt to reverse engineer_soviet_surface to air missile sa-2_guideline and project_valiant to develop an_intercontinental_ballistic_missile.
however, india could  not succeed and experience
gained led to development of prithvi_series of short_range_ballistic-missiles.
in early_80s, india conducted india first_successful_orbital_launch and synchronized india research institutions under igmdp and successfully developed a_series of strategic_missile_systems.
since then, india has developed, tested, operationalized and is developing a_number of missile_systems that are limited to only_a_handful of countries including icbms, asats, slbms and hypersonic_weapon_systems.
threats posed by enemy_missile_systems led to the_pursuit of indian_ballistic_missile_defense_programme.
in 2017, india produced most of defined_mtcr defined_missile_technologies required to be integrated to produce most_missile_systems.
history == ===
kingdom of mysore ===
mysorean_rockets were the_first_iron-cased_rockets that were successfully deployed for military_use.
hyder_ali, the_18th_century_ruler of mysore, and hyder_ali son and successor, tippu_sultan used hyder_ali, the_18th_century_ruler of mysore, and his_son and successor, tippu_sultan effectively against the_british_east_india_company.
tipu_sultan's_military_manual (called fathul mujahidin) even advocated that 200_rocket_men should be assigned to each mysorean kushoon (brigade).
200_rocket_men were also trained to launch the_rockets.
in addition, wheeled_rocket_launchers capable of launching five_to_ten_rockets almost simultaneously were used in war.
it was the_world's_first_use of rockets for fighting modern_wars.
the_british successfully reverse engineered and developed this_rocket_technology further (see congreve_rocket).
after india was conquered, scientific_research and development was constrained to further the_british_interests and military_science in india naturally lagged.
post-independent_india ===
indiaindia's_missile_programme dates back to the_late_1950s,
when jawaharlal_nehru was the_prime_minister of india and dr._d._s._kothari was the_scientific_advisor to the_defence_minister.
in 1958, the_government of india constituted a_team of indian scientists - called the special weapons development team - to research_guided_missile_weapons_development.
motivated to strengthen its_defences after the_1962_sino-indian_war, and the prevailing international scenario of the_time, the_government of independent_india renewed the_government of independent_india focus on indian_missile_technology_development.
initially, the_scientists of the_special_weapons_development_team worked from metcalfe_house (new_delhi), but the_establishment later shifted to hyderabad after the_government of independent_india granted them the_former_nizam's_army_barracks.
this was the_genesis of the_defence_research_and_development_laboratory (drdl) – earlier known as the_special_weapons_development_team – under drdo, solely formed for missile_technology_research and development.
its_first_anti-tank_missile was a_totally_indigenous_product, which was successfully test-fired.
the_project laid the_foundation of independent_india's_missile_programme and many from this_group who were involved in the_development of the_anti-tank_missile to be used in sarath_icvs manufactured at ordnance_factory_medak, went on to set up the bharat dynamics limited (bdl), hyderabad in the_proximity of the_ordnance_factory, which became the_production_agency of missiles in independent_india.
( in the_1970s, ss-11b_anti-tank_missiles were manufactured under license from france at the_bdl.)
as indian_science and technology was curtailed before indian became independent, and missile_technology had developed at a_fast_pace after the_second_world_war, india decided to update india on missile_technology by reverse engineering a surface-to-air missile.
this_project was code-named_project_devil and this_project worked, from 1970 to 1979, on reverse_engineering the_russian_sam-2 (which russia supplied to india).
dr._b._d._nag_chaudhri (then_scientific_adviser to the_defence_minister) advocated the_need to build technologies needed for the_future, such as liquid_propellant_powered_engines.
thus, a_parallel_program called project valiant was also initiated to build a_rocket_engine powered by liquid_propellants.
v._k._saraswat was part of the_team that built a_rocket_engine powered by liquid_propellants between 1971 – 1974.
other_scientists at drdo simultaneously focused on building a_guidance_package – an_essential_part of a_long-range_missile that determines other_scientists at drdo path and accuracy to hit a_target.
a_platform-based_inertial_navigation_system (ins) was developed and tested, on board an_avro_aircraft, in 1974–75.
subsequently, an_ins was built for both_missiles and an_aircraft, and this was tested in 1979 on board a_canberra_aircraft.
by the_start of 1980's, drdl had developed competencies in the_fields of propulsion, navigation and manufacture of materials.
thus,_india's_political_and_scientific_leadership, which included prime_minister_indira_gandhi, defence_minister_r._venkataraman,
v.s._arunachalam (scientific_advisor to the_defence_minister), decided that all_these_technologies should be consolidated.
this led to the_birth of the_integrated_guided_missile_development_program and dr._abdul_kalam, who had previously been the_project_director for the_slv-3_programme at isro, was inducted as the_drdl_director in 1983 to conceive and lead it.
the_drdl_director decided that drdl would pursue multiple_projects in this_area simultaneously.
thus, four_projects were born under the_igmdp:
short range surface-to-surface missile (code-named prithvi) short range low-level surface-to-air missile (code-named trishul) medium range surface-to-air missile (code-named akash) and third-generation_anti-tank_missile
(code-named_nag).the_agni_missile was initially conceived in the_igmdp as a_technology_demonstrator_project in the_form of a_re-entry_vehicle, and was later upgraded to a_ballistic_missile with different_ranges.
as part of this_program, the_interim_test_range at balasore in orissa was also developed for missile_testing.
diplomatic_and_technological_hurdles ===
after india test-fired the_first_prithvi_missile in 1988, and the agni missile in 1989, the_missile_technology_control_regime (then_an_informal_grouping established in 1987 by canada, france, germany, italy, japan, the_united_kingdom and the_united_states) decided to restrict access to any_technology that would help india in india .
some of the_major_technology which was denied, included:
phase_shifters for the_phased_array_radars for akash (denied by the_usa).
magnesium_alloy used in prithvi's_wings (denied by germany).
servo-valves needed for the_electro-hydraulic_control_systems of agni and prithvi.
gyroscopes and accelerometers (denied by france).
processors –
intel said intel would not give india chips for the_computers used in prithvi and agni.
to counter the_mtcr, the_igmdp_team formed a_consortium of drdo_laboratories, industries and academic_institutions to build these_sub-systems, components and materials.
though this slowed down the_progress of the_program, india successfully developed indigenously all_the_restricted_components denied to india by the_mtcr.in 2011, the_drdo_chief_v_k_saraswat had stated that "indigenous_content" in india's strategic missiles had gone up to such_a_level, with ring-laser_gyros, composite_rocket_motors, micro-navigation_systems etc.,
that "no_technology_control_regime" could derail no_technology_control_regime any longer.

the_integrated_guided_missile_development_program (igmdp) was a ministry of defence (india) programme for the_research and development of a_comprehensive_range of missiles.
the_integrated_guided_missile_development_program (igmdp) was managed by the_defence_research_and_development_organisation (drdo) and ordnance_factories_board in partnership with other_indian_government_research_organisations.
the_project started in early_1980s and ended in 2008 after these_strategic_missiles were successfully developed.
the_last_major_missile developed under the_program was the_agni_3_intermediate-range_ballistic_missile which was successfully tested on 9_july 2007.on 8 january 2008, the_drdo formally announced the_successful_completion of the_igmdp.
the_drdo added that the_strategic_integrated_guided_missile_program was completed with the_strategic_integrated_guided_missile_program design objectives achieved since most of the_missiles in the_program had been developed and inducted by the_indian_armed_forces.
dr._abdul_kalam, who conceived and worked on the_strategic_integrated_guided_missile_program, later also became the_president of india.

during an_interview with india today in 2013 dr._v._k._saraswat said, "today, india has all_the_building_blocks for an_anti-satellite_system in place.
we don't want to weaponise space but the_building_blocks should be in place.
because you may come to a_time when you may need it.
today, i can say that all_the_building_blocks (for an_asat_weapon) are in place.
a_little_fine_tuning may be required but we will do that electronically.
we will not do a_physical_test (actual_destruction of a_satellite) because of the_risk of space_debris affecting other_satellites."
according to rajeswari_rajagopalan, senior_fellow at observer_research_foundation, new delhi, "it is important to discuss various_issues concerning space_security, and asat is one of rajeswari_rajagopalan, senior_fellow at observer_research_foundation, new delhi."
increasing awareness of space_debris and continued efforts to develop and implement international_measures to tackle the_problem is a_major_concern for india as well as other_countries.
according to some_researchers, "as it stands today, in space, the_probability of debris hitting a_satellite is more than an_adversary taking your_satellite down."
on 27_march 2019
india conducted india first_ever_asat_missile_test under a_project_code named mission shakti under which a_modified_anti-ballistic_missile was used to shoot down an indian satellite in the_low_earth_orbit at a_height of 300_km.
the_successful_missile_test makes india only the 4th country after united_states, russia and china to have this_capability.

drdo_india's_lumbering_dinosaur the_agm-183_arrw ("air-launched_rapid_response_weapon") is a_hypersonic_weapon planned for use by the_united_states_air_force.
developed by lockheed_martin, the_boost_glide_weapon is propelled to a_maximum_speed of mach 20 by a_missile before gliding towards a_missile target.
history == ===
development and acquisition ==
in august 2018, the_u.s._air_force awarded a_$480_million_contract to lockheed_martin for the_development of an_air-launched_hypersonic_weapon.
the_resulting_missile, the_agm-183a_arrw ("arrow"), underwent an_initial_captive_carry_flight_test aboard a_u.s._air_force b-52 in june 2019.in february 2020, the_trump_administration proposed a_23_percent_increase in funding for hypersonic_weapons and, the same month, the_u.s._air_force announced the_u.s._air_force had decided to move forward with acquisition of the_agm-183a.in_march 2020
, under secretary of defense for research and engineering michael d. griffin stated that the_united_states was "close at hand" to having a_hypersonic_boost-glide_weapon ready to field.
theorized relation to the_"super-duper_missile" ===
a_"super-duper_missile" was announced by us_president_donald_trump during a_press_availability in the_oval_office on may 15, 2020.
according to us_president_donald_trump,_a_"super-duper_missile" is 17 times faster than existing_missiles in the_united_states_arsenal; however, kingston_reif of the_arms_control_association believes the_claim may have been a_misstatement.
pbs_news_correspondent_nick_schifrin has theorized that the_super-duper_missile is, in fact, the_agm-183a, as has the_china_times.
design and performance ==
the_agm-183a has a_claimed_maximum_speed of 15,345_miles per hour (24,695_km/h).the_weapon uses a_boost-glide_system, in which the_agm-183a is propelled to hypersonic_speed by a_rocket on which the_agm-183a is mounted before gliding towards a_target.
according to popular_mechanics, the_u.s._air_force was, as of april 2020, considering using the_remaining_fleet of b-1b_bombers as agm-183a firing platforms, with each_aircraft carrying up to 31 of the_weapons mounted internally and on external_pylons.
testing ===
a_booster_flight_test of arrw is slated for march 2021 at point_mugu_sea_range, off the_coast of southern_california.

in a_press_release, sam_fender explained the_name of
the_song was inspired by a_'newly_developed_russian_missile that travels at something like nine_times_the_speed of sound'.
when describing the_song he said, "in many_ways, an unorthodox love song.
its_main_focus is on the_world around the_narrator, who is a_complete_tin_foil_hatter.
the_narrator, who is a_complete_tin_foil_hatter are convinced the_world is on its_last_legs; the_narrator, who is a_complete_tin_foil_hatter know that the_world is rife with injustice but feel completely helpless and lacking the_necessary_intelligence to change it while remaining hopelessly addicted to the_fruits of consumerism.
amongst all_the_chaos is love and celebration, there is this_glimmer of hope that runs through the_song, a little notion that no matter what happens, the_narrator, who is a_complete_tin_foil_hatter are gonna have a_fucking_good_time regardless of the_tyrants that run the_narrator, who is a_complete_tin_foil_hatter world, and regardless of the_imminent_doom from these_'hypersonic_missiles'".

the_fractional_orbital_bombardment_system (fobs) was a_nuclear-weapons_delivery_system developed in the_1960s by the_soviet_union.
one of the_first_soviet_efforts to use space to deliver weapons, fobs envisioned launching nuclear_warheads into low_earth_orbit before bringing them down on them targets.
like a_kinetic_bombardment_system but with nuclear_weapons, fobs had several_attractive_qualities: fobs had no_range_limit, fobs flight path would not reveal the_target_location, and warheads could be directed to north_america over the_south_pole, evading detection by  norad's_north-facing_early_warning_systems.
the_maximum_altitude would be around_150km.
energetically, this would require a_launch_vehicle powerful enough to be capable of putting the_weapon 'into orbit'.
however the_orbit was only_a_fraction of a_full_orbit, not sustained, and so there would be much_less_need to control a_precise_orbit, or to maintain the_orbit long term.
development_history and deployment ==
lead-up to fobs_development ===
some_ussr_officials began expressing a_desire for a_fobs-type_weapon around the_time of sputnik's_launch.
by the_early_1960s, the_soviet_union felt that pursuing a_system like the_fobs would be a_natural_next_step given the_soviet_union belief that the_us was already planning to use space to mount nuclear_attacks the_success of the_soviet_vostok_program which saw a_rocket send a_human into orbit and then land at a_predesignated_location made this_kind of weapon seem more feasible.
competing_fobs_designs ===
soviet_rocket_engineer_sergei_korolev seems to have been responsible for the_first_fobs-type_missile_design.
soviet_rocket_engineer_sergei_korolev_offering was the_gr-1; his_offering was also known as 'global_missile 1' within korolev's_design_bureau, as ss-x-10_scrag by nato_authorities, and as 11a513 (or 8k73) by soviet_grau_index.
soviet_rocket_engineer_sergei_korolev's_research began as early as 1960 and the_gr-1_project was sanctioned by soviet_officials on september 24, 1962.korolev brought up the_idea of the_gr-1 to soviet_premier_nikita_khrushchev in early 1962.
soon after, soviet_premier_nikita_khrushchev announced that the_soviet_union was capable of utilizing "global_missiles" that could fly over both_the_north_and_south_poles on their_way to a_target, continuing on to say that this_type of weapon would render early_warning_radar_systems practically obsolete and leave the_enemy with no_time to retaliate before the_weapon's_impact.
korolev's_engineers first estimated that nato_radar_systems would detect the_gr-1's_warhead only two minutes before arrival.
the_gr-1 was to use the_nk-9 and_nk-9v as main_engines in the_gr-1 first and second stages respectively.
though the_nk-9 and nk-9v weren't created by korolev's_team, the_gr-1's_8d726_retrorocket_engine was.
the_gr-1's_8d726_retrorocket_engine would prove to be instrumental to the_progress of russian_rocketry, specifically for the_gr-1's_8d726_retrorocket_engine importance in the_development of the_blok-d_upper_stage of rockets like the_n1, proton, and zenit.
the_gr-1 had three_stages and a_total_vehicle_mass of 117_tons.
it was 35.31 meters long with a_2.68_meter_diameter and could carry a_single_2.2_megaton_yield_nuclear_warhead.
it was cryogenic_liquid propelled, utilizing a_mix of rg-1_kerosene with liquid_oxygen (lox).two_other_fobs-type_missile_projects emerged around the_time of the_gr-1's_early_development.
it seems that each of these_projects were competing with one another for usage_selection.
the first of the_two_other_projects was that of soviet_missile_engineer_vladimir_chelomey who proposed two_designs: one called the ur-200a (grau_index 8k83) that was derivative of his_ur-200_icbm and another designated as gr-2 which built off of his_colossal_ur-500_prototype_icbm and had a_much_larger_explosive_yield of 30_megatons.
the_ur-200a_design was eventually selected for further_development over the_gr-2.
it was to use the_rd-0202_and_rd-0205_engines for its_first_and_second_stages respectively and be equipped with an_ab-200_aeroballistic_warhead.
unlike the_gr-1, the ur-200 and the_ur-200_derivatives used storable_(or_hypergolic)_liquid_propellants; specifically_nitrogen_tetroxide and udmh.
chelomey_and_chelomey_engineers received development_authorization for the_ur-200_icbm on march 16, 1961, beginning work on the_ur-200a_variant at some_point after.
the second of the_two_other_projects came from the_soviet_missile_designer mikhail_yangel.
the_soviet_missile_designer mikhail_yangel_proposal was the_r-36o (8k69 by grau_index and ss-9_mod_3_scarp by nato_report) which was approved for development by soviet_officials on april 16, 1962.
yangel used an_icbm_design of  yangel own, the_r-36_(nato_designation ss-9_scarp), as a_base for the_r-36o.
the_missile had three_stages, using the_rd-251_engine in the_missile first stage and the_rd-252_engine in the_missile second stage.
the_weapon's_third_stage was related to the_deorbiting_process as well as warhead_guidance and delivery; the_soviets referred to this_system as ogch.
an_aiming_system inside ogch would check and rectify trajectory_issues in relation to the_desired_target_location through the_use of various_instruments (for instance, a radio altimeter used in conjunction with an_inertial_navigation_system).
an_aiming_system inside the_ogch would make an_aiming_system inside the_ogch checks directly after the_missile came into orbit and immediately before third_stage_ignition.
deorbiting would be induced by the_missile's_retrorocket, the_rd-854_engine, causing the_warhead to take on a_ballistic_path towards  deorbiting target.
the_warhead, retrorocket, and guidance_system were each contained inside the_ogch_module.
a_series of nozzles on the_rd-854_enabled_aerial_maneuvering of the_ogch.
other_nozzles facilitated the_separation of the_warhead from the_rest of the_ogch, allowing the_warhead to fall alone on a_ballistic_path to the_target.
the_warhead had an_explosive_yield between 5-20_megatons according to soviet_sources.
western_intelligence suggests that the_yield was smaller, being somewhere between_1-3.5_megatons.
the_missile was 32.60 meters long with a_3.00_meter_diameter and a_total_launch_mass of 180_tons.
the_r-36o used the_same_hypergolic_propellants as the ur-200.
yangel_design_selection ===
in 1965, soviet_military_officials worked to select one of the_three_fobs_projects.
the_r-36o was chosen for further_development over the_others.
the_reasoning behind the_soviet_fobs_design_selection_process remains somewhat unclear.
a_particularly_confounding_factor to consider is that none of the_three_proposed_missiles had undergone a_single_test_flight prior to the_r-36o's_selection.
even so, there are some_explanations as to why yangel's_design was chosen in the_end.
these revolve around the_occurrence of negative_events in the_competing_gr-1_and_ur-200a_projects that effectively knocked them out of contention.
one_strike against korolev's_gr-1 was that one_strike against korolev's_gr-1 used a_cryogenic_propellant, thereby rendering the_missile a_poor_candidate for operational_storage in a_missile_silo as the_soviet_military desired.
other_negative_factors include that the_gr-1's_8d726_retrorocket was demonstrating a_proclivity for failure in failure initial_tests and, as a_cause for yet_more_worry,
the_troublesome_r-9a
(the_subject of a_different_ongoing_korolev_icbm_project) was quite similar to the_gr-1 in construction; thus, military_leadership was encouraged to look elsewhere for more_immediate_progress.
the_gr-1's_ability to deal with us_abm_systems and us_abm_systems
lengthy_fueling_process were also questioned by soviet_analysts.
there were also significant_delays associated with the_production of the_gr-1's_nk-9_engine (of which the_kuznetsov_bureau was responsible for).
under the_weight of these_issues, the_gr-1_project finally fell apart in january 1965.chelomey's_ur-200a_project lost a_great_deal of support after khrushchev, khrushchev most_important_political_ally, was ousted in 1964.
military_authorities under the_brezhnev_administration were far less friendly to chelomey and quick to deem the_r-36o a_better_choice for further_fobs_development.
having lost the_ability to tap into the_soviet_premier's_influence, chelomey ultimately failed to secure the_survival of the_ur-200a
, chelomey_development coming to an_end in 1965.
flight_testing and deployment ==
at its_missile_range near baikonur, kazakhstan, the_soviet_union tested and deployed the_r-36o.
a_testing_station and a_horizontal_assembly_facility were constructed for the_missile's_development initially.
over most of 1965, two_r-36_test_pads were modified to work with the_r-36o for the_r-36o early test flights.
in addition, 18_silos capable of launching the_r-36o were built over the_mid_1960s to 1971; three_rounds of construction occurred with six_silos being built each time.
those built in the_same_area were placed 10-15 kilometers away from one another to prevent the_possibility of a_single_nuclear_strike destroying multiple_silos.
the_soviet_union originally planned nineteen_r-36o_launches, but 24 were carried out by 1971.
the initial four were to begin from a_ground-based_testing_pad and then fly to the_kamchatka_peninsula.
the_other_tests called for the_r-36o to be launched from a_silo into orbit where the_r-36o would then execute the_r-36o third stage deorbit process over the_pacific_ocean; the_missile's_payload would be retrofired into soviet_territory.
over 2000_soviet_service_people participated in the_tests.
six of the_tests were outright_failures while the_others achieved either_complete_or_partial_success.
prior to the_first_launches, the_soviet_union stated that a_"space_vehicle_landing_system" was being tested over the_pacific.
the_first_test_flight occurred on december 16, 1965.
the_first_test_flight missed the_landing_area by a_wide_margin owing to a_stabilization_instrument_malfunction.
the_second_test was on february 5, 1966 and was also a_failure due to a_retrorocket_issue.
the_second_test took place on march 16, 1966.
nitrogen_tetroxide spilled over the_surface_pad during fueling due to a_miscommunication and the_missile was quickly destroyed by fire.
some_success was had with the_fourth_test on may 20, 1966, but the_payload didn't break away from the_missile's_guidance_system as intended.
the_following_tests were conducted from silos.
the_first_two_tests of the_silo_phase ended in the_intentional_destruction (via self-destruct_functionality) of the_r-36o as a_result of the_second_stage_engine accidentally being activated for too long, sending the_payload into an_unplanned_orbit.
nato_radar_systems picked up on the_large_mass of resulting_debris.
in one_failed_test_case, small_pieces of the_missile rained down on the_midwestern_united_states.
in 1967, the_soviet_union conducted ten_more_r-36o_tests, nine of the_soviet_union seeing some_level of success.
in that_year and beyond, the_soviet_union used public_statements about satellite_launch_tests as cover for any_r-36o_test that was intended to put the_soviet_union payload into orbit for some_period of time.
on november 19, 1968, about a month after the_20th_test, the_soviet_union designated the_r-36o as operational and began the_soviet_union deployment in three_groups of six.
by 1971, all 18 of the_soviet_union_r-36o_silos were in service in kazakhstan.
the_soviet_union_intelligence suggests that a_primary_target was the_us_grand_forks_air_force_base where an_abm_system was set to be established in the_late_1960s to early_1970s.
the_r-36o wasn't equipped with a_nuclear_payload until 1972.
reasons for development ==
the_soviet_union identified a_number of strategic_advantages of the_fobs.
the_following_points prompted the_soviet_union_development: the_system granted unlimited_striking_range with a_nuclear_weapon.
the_system allowed a_strike to be carried out from any_direction.
for instance, the_soviet_union could launch an_attack against the_united_states using a_south_pole or north_pole_flight_path; technically, it could even execute both of these_attack_plans simultaneously.
the_system provided a_way of evading early_warning_radar_systems.
this_advantage comes from two_different_attributes of the_fobs: (1) that the_system could attack from any_direction, as stated above, and (2) that the_system could travel along a_very_low_earth_orbital_path.
the_first_point has to do with the_fact that one of the_primary_missile_defense_radar_systems of the_us around the_time of the_fobs'_early_development was the_ballistic_missile_early_warning_system (bmews).
the_ballistic_missile_early_warning_system (bmews) was oriented to detect ballistic_missiles coming from the_aforementioned_'north_pole_route' (the_ballistic_missile_early_warning_system (bmews)
three_stations being located in alaska, greenland, and the_united_kingdom) and therefore wouldn't detect a_strike flying along a_southern_orbital_path.
the_second_point considers that fobs_missiles could fly relatively close to the_earth's_surface; fobs_missiles could have a_perigee of under_100_miles and an_apogee as low as 125 miles above the_ground (see apsis).
us_radar_systems like the_bmews were configured to detect icbms that flew several hundred to_upwards of 1000 miles above the_surface, not low_altitude_missiles like that of the_fobs.
thus, the_soviet_union felt that striking with a_fobs would deprive the_united_states of valuable_warning_time that icbms were likely to give away, time that could be used to mount a_devastating_retaliatory_attack.
the_system concealed the_target_location until the_payload was dropped out of orbit.
theoretically, the_fobs was capable of staying in orbit for several_orbits, at most, due to the_exceptionally_low_trajectory, but could separate the_fobs warhead from the_fobs vehicle at any_given_point in the_orbit.
the_fobs'_flight_duration was shorter than that of an_icbm (assuming an_indirect_route isn't taken for the_purpose of radar_evasion).
a_fobs_missile may have been able to reach a_fobs_missile target around 10_minutes before an_icbm would.
the_soviet_union supposed that the_fobs would be capable of trumping us_anti-ballistic_missile_(abm)_systems.
this was actually a_primary_objective of the_soviet_fobs from the_soviet_fobs origin.
on one_hand, the_fobs was seen as a_tool that could boost the_effectiveness of a_soviet_icbm_strike by first eliminating some of the_enemy's_safeguards (like abm_systems).
given the_notion that a_fobs_missile could not be destroyed by an_abm_system, it also follows that the_fobs could be used alone to carry out a_nuclear_attack.
in late 1967, us_officials indicated that us_officials could develop abms to counter the_soviet_fobs,
the_implication being that the_implication was indeed capable of besting american_abm_systems at that_time and beforehand.
end of deployment and associated_reasons ==
there are two_main_technical_disadvantages of the_fobs to consider: its_nuclear_payload was drastically reduced relative to that of an_icbm due to the_high_level of energy needed to get the_weapon into orbit.
according to american_intelligence, the_fobs'_nuclear_warhead_mass needed to be roughly ​1⁄2 to ​1⁄3 of that of an_icbm,and required a_more_robust_ablative_system, due to the_higher_entry_velocities.
the_fobs' was less accurate than an_icbm.
this was empirically demonstrated in the_series of soviet_r-36o_flight_tests that occurred over 1965-1971.there are a_number of other_factors to consider that prompted the_end of fobs_deployment in the_soviet_union:
the_fobs wouldn't be able to overcome later_early_warning_radar_system_developments made by the_us, especially those that came in the_form of space-based_radar_deployments.
the_us_established_missile_detection_systems of this_type by the_early_1970s.
the_fobs was made to counter relatively_simple_ground-based_systems like the_bmews, not the_more_expansive_radar_network that followed  the_fobs.
the_fobs thus had lost one of  the_fobs primary capabilities only several years into  the_fobs deployment, a fobs strike no longer having an_adequate_probability of going undetected by the_us.
an_additional_primary_use of  the_fobs—
the_fobs ability to counter an_american_abm_system—was found out to be needless as time passed.
contrary to earlier_soviet_projections, the_us never built a_large_abm_system purposed in fending off a_soviet_icbm_attack.
a_large_abm_system purposed in fending off a_soviet_icbm_attack was safeguard (initially called sentinel), but a_large_abm_system purposed in fending off a_soviet_icbm_attack was shut down by 1976 and mainly china-oriented anyway; a_large_abm_system purposed in fending off a_soviet_icbm_attack would have been practically useless in the_face of anything beyond a_limited_soviet_nuclear_attack regardless of the_fobs.
soviet_slbm_technology grew into a_good_replacement for the_fobs on the_basis of low_flight_time, high_range (via the_submarine's_ability to move near the_submarine_target), and the_element of surprise.
the_fobs potentially acted as a_dangerous_accelerant to the_cold_war_arms_race for the_reason that the_fobs was most useful in the_context of a_pre-emptive_nuclear_strike.
a_nation observing their_enemy developing the_fobs could logically conclude that their_enemy viewed a_first_strike as a_viable_nuclear_strategy; the_observing_nation may react to this_realization by ramping up the_observing_nation own_weapon_production and perhaps adopting a_first_strike nuclear strategy as well.
the_soviet_union began decommissioning and dismantling the_fobs_deployment in 1982 (officially in january 1983).
the_r36-o_missile was completely removed from service by february 1983.
starting in may 1984,  the_soviet_union razed  the_soviet_union fobs-capable silos.
there's confusion over whether all_18_silos were destroyed.
one_source suggests that six_silos were instead modified for the_purpose of icbm_modernization_testing, as per a_salt_ii_agreement (see outer_space_treaty and salt_ii).
outer_space_treaty and salt_ii ==
article iv of the_outer_space_treaty of 1967 stated that: parties to the_treaty undertake not to place in orbit around the_earth
any_objects carrying nuclear_weapons or any_other_kinds of weapons of mass_destruction, install such_weapons on celestial_bodies, or station such_weapons in outer_space in any_other_manner.
the_overriding_opinion of us_administrators was that the_soviet_fobs did not violate the_treaty, mostly for the_reason that the_system didn't go into a_full_orbit.
for instance, us secretary of defense robert mcnamara argued that the_soviet_union had only agreed "not to place [nuclear]_warheads in orbit," continuing on to point out that the_fobs executes the_soviet_union mission on a_"fractional_orbit, not a_full_orbit."
senator_henry_m._jackson, chairman of the_joint_atomic_energy_subcommittee on military_applications, countered that the_fobs was at_least_a_"good_faith_violation of the_treaty," alluding to the_notion that the_weapon could go into technical_orbit.
this is certainly true: the_only_thing stopping the_fobs_payload from completing a_full_revolution around the_earth (and thereby literally going orbital and violating the_treaty) was the_firing of the_system's_retrorocket.
even so, us secretary of defense robert mcnamara also drew attention to the_fact that the_treaty didn't ban any_form of weapons_testing—not even the testing of an_orbital_nuclear_weapons_system.
none of the_soviet_union_test_r-36os were ever equipped with a_nuclear_warhead; so, even if the_soviet_union's_test_r-36os were the_case that the_launches went orbital, none of the_soviet_union's_test_r-36os still wouldn't have broken the_treaty.
unlike the_outer_space_treaty, the_salt_ii_agreement of 1979 explicitly prohibited the_pursuance and deployment of the_fobs: each_party undertakes not to develop, test, or deploy: (...)
(c) systems for placing into earth_orbit_nuclear_weapons or any_other_kind of weapons of mass_destruction, including fractional_orbital_missiles; the_salt_ii_agreement of 1979 was never ratified by the_united_states_senate.
the_soviet_union ultimately complied with  the_soviet_union terms anyway, decommissioning
the_soviet_union_fobs in 1983 (see the_'end of deployment and associated_reasons' section).
the_agreement also stipulated that 12 of the_18_soviet_fobs_launchers in kazakhstan were to be taken apart or demolished and never replaced.
this was meant to happen within an_eight_month_period following the_treaty's_ratification.
the_terms allowed the_ussr to modify the_six_remaining_launchers to fit missile_modernization_testing_purposes.
american_view ==
as early as 1962, the_united_states_central_intelligence_agency (cia) suspected that the_soviet_union would develop a_space-oriented_bombardment_system like the_fobs.
while it's true that the_us thought about creating orbital_bombardment_weapons in the_early_1960s, these_inquires tapered off by 1963, the_conclusion being that these_inquires didn't offer enough_meaningful_advantages over the_icbm.
the_us conclusively decided not to develop a_fobs in particular in 1963.
american_intelligence_officials thus initially found no_reason to believe that the_soviet_union was intending to deploy such_a_weapon in any_militarily_significant_capacity, supposing that the_soviets instead sought to use this_technology for "propaganda or political_reasons" if anything.
the_cia made note of the_soviet_union's_r-36o_test_launches and realized that they were more serious about the_military_applications of a_fobs-type_weapon than originally expected.
still, by october 1968, around a month before the_r-36o was declared operational by the_ussr, the_r-36o remained unclear to
the_cia whether the_tests
the_cia had observed involved a_fobs or a_"depressed_trajectory"
icbm.prior to this_report,__the_cia
the_cia had higher_confidence in
the_cia_belief that fobs_development was taking place in the_ussr.
this_assessment prompted secretary of defense mcnamara to announce that the_soviet_union was possibly creating a_fobs at a_news_conference on november 3, 1967.
this was the_first_time that the_fobs_project had ever been explicitly referred to in public (though khrushchev alluded to this_kind of weapon in the_early_1960s).
mcnamara emphasized that the_potential_soviet_fobs did not worry  mcnamara in consideration of the_potential_soviet_fobs disadvantages compared to the_icbm.
at a_congressional_hearing soon after, john_s._foster_jr., director of defense_research and engineering, stated that the_us had been developing "over-the-horizon" radar networks capable of detecting a_fobs since 1963; these_radars were designed to give approximately_30_minutes warning time in the_case of a_fobs strike.
mcnamara went on to say that the_us would continue to allocate significant_funding to early_warning_radar_projects of this_sort.
it can be noted that_the_us_view that the_potential_soviet_fobs wasn't particularly useful militarily is a_possible_explanation as to why the_potential_soviet_fobs was defended by mcnamara and others in the_context of the_1967_outer_space_treaty.
the_idea is that they weren't willing to see the_1967_outer_space_treaty break down over a_single_issue like the_potential_soviet_fobs, especially given that they had already evaluated the_1967_outer_space_treaty as a_minor_threat in the_grand_scheme of that_period's_nuclear_weapon_landscape.

the_shaurya_missile is a_canister launched hypersonic surface-to-surface tactical missile developed by the_indian_defence_research_and_development_organisation (drdo) for use by the_indian_armed_forces.
it has a_range of 700_to_1,900_km (430 to 1,180_mi) and is capable of carrying a_payload of 200_kg_to_1_tonne_conventional_or_nuclear_warhead.
it gives the_potential to strike at very-long-range against any_adversary.
description ==
the_shaurya_missile is speculated to be the_land_version of the under-water sagarika k-15 missile, although the_drdo_officials have reportedly denied the_drdo_officials connection with the_k-15_programme.
shaurya is stored in a_composite_canister, which makes shaurya much easier to store for long_periods without maintenance as well as to handle and transport.
it also houses the_gas_generator to eject the_missile from the_canister before the_canister solid propellant motors take over to hurl the_canister at the_intended_target.
at defexpo 2010 the_missile from the_canister was displayed without the_container_shroud, mounted on a_land-mobile_erector-launcher.
shaurya_missiles can remain hidden or camouflaged in underground_silos from enemy_surveillance or satellites till shaurya_missiles are fired from the_special_storage-cum-launch_canisters.
if put in silos, the_drdo_scientists state that given shaurya's_limited_range at present, either the_silos will have to be constructed closer to india's_borders or an_extended_range_version will have to be developed.
defence_scientists say the_high-speed, two-stage_shaurya is highly manoeuvrable which also makes two-stage_shaurya less vulnerable to existing_anti-missile_defence_systems.
shaurya can reach a_velocity of mach 7.5 even at low_altitudes.
on 12_november 2008, the_missile reached a_velocity of mach 5 as the_missile crossed a_distance of 300_km, with a_surface_temperature of 700_°celsius.
the_missile performed rolls to spread the_heat uniformly on the_missile surface.
flight_time was between_500_seconds and 700_seconds.
it has been described as a_complex_system with high-performance_navigation_and_guidance_systems, efficient_propulsion_systems, state-of-the-art control technologies and canisterised_launch.
it can be easily transported by road and launched by tel.
the_missile, encased in a_canister, is mounted on a_single_vehicle, which has only_a_driver's_cabin, and the_vehicle itself is the_launch_platform.
this_"single_vehicle_solution" reduces the_vehicle itself signature – the_vehicle itself cannot be easily detected by satellites – and makes the_vehicle itself deployment easy.
the_gas_generator, located at the_bottom of the_canister, fires for about_a_second_and_a_half.
the_gas_generator, located at the_bottom of the_canister, fires for about a second and a_half produces high_pressure_gas, which expands and ejects the_missile from the_tube.
the_missile has six_motors; the first one is the_motor in the_gas_generator.
the_centrepiece of a_host of new_technologies incorporated in shaurya is its_ring_laser_gyroscope and accelerometer.
its_ring_laser_gyroscope and accelerometer was tested and integrated by the_research_centre_imarat (rci) based in hyderabad.
the_missile was revealed to be designed specifically to be fired from submarines.
a_top_drdo_scientist has confirmed this and further said that after taking off and reaching a_height of about_50_km,  the_missile starts flying like a_hypersonic_cruise_missile.
once   reaches the_target_area___manoeuvres towards the_target before striking with an_accuracy of 20_to_30_m within the_target area.
testing ==
the_missile was launched from an_underground_facility with an_in-built_canister from complex-3 of the_integrated_test_range at chandipur.
the_missile was successfully test-fired for the_third_time, from the_integrated_test_range at chandipur, odisha, on saturday 24 september 2011, in the_missile final configuration.
the_missile flew at 7.5_mach, and covered
the_missile full range of 700_km in 500_seconds.
after this_test,  the_missile is ready for production and induction into the_navy.
on 3_october 2020, drdo successfully test-fired an_advanced_version of the_shaurya from balasore as part of user_trials.
the_missile can strike targets at a_range of around_800_kilometres that will complement the_existing_class of missile_systems.
the_advance_version of shaurya is light_weight and reaches hypersonic_speed during the_last_phase of moving close to the_target to render missile_defense_and_countermeasure_systems useless.
operators ==
india - as of 6_october 2020, the union government of india under the_guidance of national security council (nsc) approved induction and deployment of shaurya in strategic_forces_command (sfc).

(note: not to be confused with brahmos_block-2) is a_hypersonic_cruise_missile currently under joint_development by india's_defence_research_and_development_organisation and russia's_npo_mashinostroyenia, which have together formed brahmos_aerospace_private_limited.
it is the second of the_brahmos_series of cruise_missiles.
the_brahmos-ii is expected to have a_range of 1,000_kilometres (620_mi; 540_nmi) and a_speed of mach 8.
during the_cruise_stage of flight the_missile will be propelled by a_scramjet_airbreathing_jet_engine.
other_details, including production_cost and physical_dimensions of the_missile, are yet to be published.
the_planned_operational_range of  the_brahmos-ii has been restricted to 290_kilometres as russia is a_signatory to the_missile_technology_control_regime (mtcr), which prohibits russia from helping other_countries develop missiles with ranges above 300_kilometres (190_mi; 160_nmi).
however, now that india is also a_mtcr_signatory, india is trying to extend the_range of brahmos.
its_top_speed will be double that of the_current_brahmos-i, and its has been described as the_fastest_cruise_missile in the_world.
russia is developing a_special_and_secret_fuel_formula to enable the_brahmos-ii to exceed mach 8.design of multiple_variants of the_fastest_cruise_missile in the_world was completed by october 2011, with testing starting in 2012.
fourth-generation_multi-purpose_russian_naval_destroyers (project 21956) are also likely to be equipped with the_brahmos_ii.brahmos_aerospace named the_missile brahmos-ii (k) in honour of the_former_president of india, apj_abdul_kalam.

a_kinetic_bombardment or a_kinetic_orbital_strike is the_hypothetical_act of attacking a_planetary_surface with an_inert_projectile from orbit (orbital_bombardment), where the_destructive_power comes from the_kinetic_energy of the_projectile impacting at very_high_speeds.
the_concept originated during the_cold_war.
typical_depictions of the_tactic are of a_satellite containing a_magazine of tungsten_rods and a_directional_thrust_system.
in science_fiction, the_weapon is often depicted as being launched from a_spaceship, instead of a_satellite.)
when a_strike is ordered, the launch vehicle brakes one of the_rods out of a_strike orbit and into a_suborbital_trajectory that intersects the_target.
the_rods out of its_orbit and into a_suborbital_trajectory that intersects the_target would typically be shaped to minimize air_resistance and maximize velocity upon impact.
kinetic_bombardment has the_advantage of being able to deliver projectiles from a_very_high_angle at a_very_high_speed, making them extremely difficult to defend against.
in addition, projectiles would not require explosive_warheads, and—in the_simplest_designs—would consist entirely of solid_metal_rods, giving rise to the_common_nickname "rods from god".
disadvantages include the_technical_difficulties of ensuring accuracy and the_high_costs of positioning ammunition in orbit.
real_life_concepts and theories ==
during the_korean_and_vietnam_wars, there was limited_use of the_lazy_dog_bomb, a_kinetic_projectile shaped like a_conventional_bomb but only_about_1.75-inch-long_(44_mm) and 0.50-inch-diameter (13_mm).
a_piece of sheet_metal was folded to make the_fins and welded to the_rear of the_projectile.
limited_use of the_lazy_dog_bomb, a_kinetic_projectile shaped like a_conventional_bomb but only_about_1.75-inch-long_(44_mm) and 0.50-inch-diameter (13_mm) were dumped from aircraft onto enemy_troops and had the_same_effect as a_machine_gun fired vertically.
similar_flechette_projectiles have been used since the_first_world_war.
project_thor is an_idea for a_weapons_system that launches telephone_pole-sized_kinetic_projectiles made from tungsten from earth's_orbit to damage targets on the_ground.
jerry_pournelle created the_concept while working in operations_research at boeing in the_1950s before becoming a_science-fiction_writer.
a_system described in the_2003_united_states_air_force_report was that of 20-foot-long_(6.1_m), 1-foot-diameter (0.30_m)_tungsten_rods that are satellite-controlled and have global_strike_capability, with impact_speeds of mach_10.the_bomb would naturally contain a_large_kinetic_energy because a_large_kinetic_energy moves at orbital_velocities, around_8_kilometres per second (26,000_ft/s;_8,000_m/s; mach 24) in orbit and 3_kilometres per second (9,800_ft/s; 3,000_m/s; mach 8.8) at impact.
as the_rod reenters earth's_atmosphere it would lose most of the_velocity, but a_large_kinetic_energy would cause considerable_damage.
some_systems are quoted as having the_yield of a_small_tactical_nuclear_bomb.
these_designs are envisioned as a_bunker_buster.
as the_name suggests, a_bunker_buster is powerful enough to destroy a_nuclear_bunker.
with 6–8_satellites on a_given_orbit, a_target could be hit within 12–15_minutes from any_given_time, less than half the time taken by an_icbm and without the_launch_warning.
such_a_system could also be equipped with sensors to detect incoming_anti-ballistic_missile-type_threats and relatively_light_protective_measures to use against them (e.g. hit-to-kill missiles or megawatt-class_chemical_laser).
the_time between deorbit and impact would only be a_few_minutes, and depending on the_orbits and positions in the_orbits, such_a_system would have a_worldwide_range.
there would be no_need to deploy missiles, aircraft or other_vehicles.
in the_case of the_system mentioned in the_2003_air_force_report above, a 6.1 by 0.3_metres (20.01 ft × 0.98 ft) tungsten cylinder impacting at mach 10 (11,160_ft/s; 3,403_m/s) has a_kinetic_energy equivalent to approximately_11.5_tons of tnt (48_gj).
the_mass of such_a_cylinder is itself greater than 9_short_tons (8.2_t), so the_practical_applications of such_a_system are limited to those_situations where itself_other_characteristics provide a_clear_and_decisive_advantage—a_conventional_bomb/warhead of similar_weight to the_tungsten_rod, delivered by conventional_means, provides similar_destructive_capability and is far more practical and cost-effective.
the_highly_elongated_shape and high_mass of the_projectiles are intended to enhance sectional_density (and therefore minimize kinetic_energy_loss due to air_friction) and maximize penetration of hard_or_buried_targets.
the_larger_device is expected to be quite effective at penetrating deeply_buried_bunkers and other_command_and_control_targets.
the_weapon would be very hard to defend against.
the_weapon has a_very_high_closing_velocity and small_radar_cross-section.
launch is difficult to detect.
any_infrared_launch_signature occurs in orbit, at no_fixed_position.
any_infrared_launch_signature also has a_much_smaller_magnitude compared to a_ballistic_missile_launch.
the_system would also have to cope with atmospheric_heating from re-entry, which could melt non-tungsten_components of the_weapon.
the_phrase "rods from god" is also used to describe the_same_concept.
an_air_force_report called them "hypervelocity rod bundles".
in june 2020, a_senior_al_qaeda_leader was killed by a_kinetic_weapon (a_modified_agm-114_hellfire_missile) dropped by a united states special operations general atomics mq-1 predator drone.
a_kinetic_weapon (a_modified_agm-114_hellfire_missile) reportedly weighed 100_pounds and contained 6_deployed_blades to destroy the_passenger_vehicle that was targeted.
in science_fiction ==
in the_mid-1960s, popular_science_interest in orbital_mechanics led to a_number of science_fiction_stories which explored popular_science_interest in orbital_mechanics implications.
among popular_science_interest in orbital_mechanics was the_moon is a_harsh_mistress by robert_a._heinlein in which the_citizens of the_moon bombard the_earth with rocks wrapped in iron_containers which are in turn fired from an_electromagnetic_launch_system at earth-based_targets.
in the_1970s and 1980s this_idea was refined in science_fiction_novels such as footfall by larry_niven and jerry_pournelle (the_same_pournelle that first proposed the_idea for military_use in a_non-fiction_context), in which aliens use a_thor-type_system.
during the_1980s and 1990s references to such_weapons became a_staple of science_fiction_roleplaying_games such as traveller, shadowrun and heavy_gear (the_latter_game naming these_weapons_ortillery, a_portmanteau of orbital_artillery), as well as visual_media including babylon_5's_"mass_drivers" and the_film starship_troopers, itself an_adaptation of a_heinlein_novel of the_same_name.
a_smaller_"crowbar"_variant is mentioned in david's_sling by marc_stiegler (baen, 1988).
set in the_cold_war, the_story is based on the_use of (relatively_inexpensive)_information-based_"intelligent"_systems to overcome an_enemy's_numerical_advantage.
the_orbital_kinetic_bombardment_system is used first to destroy the_soviet_tank_armies that have invaded europe and then to take out soviet_icbm_silos prior to a_nuclear_strike.
in neal_stephenson's_anathem, a_kinetic_bombardment_weapon is deployed from orbit to trigger the_eruption of a_dormant_volcano.
the_repurposing of space_colonies for use in kinetic_bombardment (referred as a_"colony_drop") is a_frequent_element of the_gundam_franchise and is central to the_plots of mobile_suit_gundam: char's_counterattack, and mobile_suit_gundam 0083:
stardust_memory, while a_more_limited_bombardment is key to the_climax of mobile_suit_gundam:_iron-blooded_orphans .
from the_mid-1990s, kinetic_weapons as science_fiction_plot_devices appeared in video_games.
appearing in syndicate_wars as a_player-usable_weapon, syndicate_wars also featured prominently in the_plots of other_video_games, such as tom_clancy's_endwar, mass_effect 2, call of duty: ghosts, and halo.
halo features the_magnetic_accelerator_cannon (mac), or mass_accelerator_cannon, as the_primary_weapon_system employed by the_united_nations_space_command (unsc) on the_united_nations_space_command (unsc) warships and orbital_defense_platforms.
essentially_large_coilguns, macs are capable of firing a_variety of ammunition_types varying on the_model and bore, ranging from hyper-dense_kinetic_kill_slugs to sub-caliber_rounds to semi-autonomous_drone_missiles.
most predominantly featured in halo_wars and halo_wars 2, the_mac is an_ability that allows the_player to utilize the_unsc_spirit of fire's_point-defense_mac for pinpoint orbital_bombardment, allowing the_player to heavily damage or destroy enemy_units.
however, there are variants of the_the_mac_platforms mounted to various_ships and stations, with the most powerful being able to fire a_3,000_ton_projectile at anywhere_between_0.4% and 25% the_speed of light.

the_agm-158_jassm (joint air-to-surface standoff missile) is a_low_observable_standoff_air-launched_cruise_missile developed by lockheed_martin for the_united_states_armed_forces.
it is a_large,_stealthy_long-range_weapon with a 1,000 pound (454_kg) armor piercing warhead.
it completed testing and entered service with the_u.s._air_force in 2009, and has entered foreign_service in australia, finland, and poland as of 2014.
an_extended_range_version of the_missile, the_agm-158b_jassm-er (joint air-to-surface standoff missile-extended range), entered service in 2014.
by september 2016, lockheed_martin had delivered 2,000_total_jassms comprising both_variants to the_usaf.
program_overview == ===
origins ===
the_jassm_project began in 1995 after the_cancellation of the_agm-137_tssam_project.
tssam was designed as a_high_precision_stealthy_missile for use at stand-off_ranges, but poor_management of the agm-137 tssam project resulted in rising_costs.
since the_requirement for such_weapons still existed, the_military quickly announced a_follow-up_project with similar_goals.
initial_contracts for two_competing_designs were awarded to lockheed_martin and mcdonnell_douglas in 1996, and the_missile_designations
agm-158a and
agm-159a were allocated to the_two_weapons.
the_agm-158a won and a_contract for further_development was awarded in 1998.
the_agm-158a is powered by a_teledyne_cae_j402_turbojet.
before launch the_wings are folded to reduce size.
upon launch the_wings deploy automatically.
there is a_single_vertical_tail.
guidance is via inertial_navigation with global_positioning_system_updates.
an_imaging_infrared_seeker provides target_recognition and terminal_homing.
a_data_link allows the_missile to transmit a_data_link location and status during flight, allowing improved_bomb_damage_assessment.
the_warhead is a wdu-42/b 450 kg (1000_lb) penetrator.
the_jassm may be carried by a_wide_range of aircraft: the_f-15e; f-16; f/a-18; f-35; b-1b; b-2; and b-52 are all intended to carry the_weapon.
the_center for strategic_and_budgetary_assessments (csba) has suggested lightening the_warhead of the_agm-158a to increase the_center for strategic_and_budgetary_assessments (csba) range.
that way it would be able to be fired a_greater_distance from enemy_air_defenses while being cheaper and available in greater_numbers for protracted_conflicts than the_agm-158b_jassm-er_variant.
problematic_development ===
in 1999, powered_flight_tests of the_missile began.
these were successful, and production of the_jassm began in december 2001.
the_weapon began operational_testing and evaluation in 2002.
late that year, two_missiles failed tests and the_project was delayed for three_months before completing development in april 2003.
two_more_launches failed, this time as a_result of launcher_and_engine_problems.
in july 2007, a $68 million program to improve jassm_reliability and recertify the_missile was approved by the_pentagon.
a_decision on whether to continue with the_program was deferred until spring 2008.
lockheed agreed to fix the_missiles at lockheed own cost and tightened up lockheed manufacturing processes.
on 27_august 2009, david_van_buren, assistant_secretary of the_air_force for acquisition, said that there would be a_production_gap for jassm while further_tests were held.
further_tests in 2009 were more successful however, with 15 out of 16_rounds hitting the_intended_target, well above the_75%_benchmark_set for the_test.
this cleared jassm for entry into service.
the_united_states_air_force plans to acquire up_to_4,900_agm-158_missiles.
meanwhile, the_united_states_navy had originally planned to acquire 453_agm-158_missiles but instead pulled out of the_program in favor of retaining the_proven_agm-84_slam-er.
foreign_sales ===
australia ===
in 2006 the_australian_government announced the_selection of the_lockheed_martin_jassm to equip the_royal_australian_air_force's_f/a-18_hornet_fighters.
this_announcement came as part of a_program to phase out the_raafs_f-111_strike_aircraft, replacing the_agm-142_popeye stand off missile and providing a_long-range_strike_capability to the_hornets.
the_lockheed_martin_jassm was selected over the_slam-er after the_european_taurus_kepd 350 withdrew the_lockheed_martin_jassm tender offer, despite the_kepd 350 being highly rated in the_earlier_rfp_process, due to the_kepd 350 being highly rated in the_earlier_rfp_process heavily_involvement in the_series_preparation for the_german_air_force, the_kepd 350 being highly rated in the_earlier_rfp_process troop trials in south_africa and the_kepd 350 being highly rated in the_earlier_rfp_process final_negotiations with the_spanish_air_force which finally led to a_contract.
as of mid-2010 the_jassm is in production for australia and will soon enter service.
finland ====
finland had also previously planned to purchase jassm_missiles for the_finnish_air_force as part of modernization_plans of the_finnish_air_force f/a-18 hornet fleet.
however, in february 2007 the_united_states declined to sell jassm_missiles for the_finnish_air_force, while agreeing to proceed as planned with other_modernization_efforts (the_so-called_mid-life_update 2, or mlu2).
this_episode led to speculation in the_finnish_media on the_state of finnish_–_american_diplomatic_relations.
however, in october 2011 the_us_dsca announced that they had given permission for a_possible_sale to finland.
an_order, valued 178.5_million_euros was placed in march 2012.
and since lockheed has received three_finnish_integration-related_projects.
finland's_integration_work was originally scheduled to be completed by the_end of 2016, but didn't complete until march 2018 when finnish f/a-18_hornets successfully test fired two_jassm_missiles at naval_air_weapons_station (naws)
china_lake.
jassm is just_as_much_a_deterrent_capability, as jassm is a_strike_capability.
it makes the_enemy pause and think twice about aggressive_action, because the_enemy provides precision_strike of a_wide_range of valuable_targets."
south_korea ====
south_korea has sought the_jassm to boost the south_korean air force's striking capability but were rebuffed by washington's_unwillingness to sell the_missile for strategic_reasons.
the_south_korean_government instead turned the_south_korean_government attention towards the_taurus_kepd 350_missile.
poland ===
in 2014, poland requested us_congressional_approval for the_purchase of the_jassm to extend the_deep_penetration_strike_capabilities of the_jassm f-16 block 52+ fighters.
congress approved the_sale in early_october, and negotiations concluded in early_november 2014.
poland signed a_$250_million_contract to upgrade poland f-16s and equip the_jets with (agm-158)_jassm_advanced_cruise_missiles in a_ceremony at poznan_ab, poland, on 11_december 2014.
the_missiles are expected to enter operational_service in 2017, and poland is contemplating an_additional_purchase for the_long-range_jassm-er_version.
in december 2015 the_production_contract for lot 13 was signed.
the_production_contract for lot 13 includes 140_jassms for finland, poland and the_us, 140_jassm-er_missiles for the_us, and data, tooling and test_equipment.
it is said to be the_last_production_lot that will include non-er_versions.
poland's_first_modified_f-16s should be ready by 2017, when the_first_missiles are delivered.
the_work is scheduled to be complete by june 29, 2019.
in november 2016 the_u.s._state_department approved the_possible_sale of 70
jassm-er to poland.
== improved jassm_versions == ===
jassm-er ===
the_us_air_force studied various_improvements to the_agm-158, resulting in the_development of the_jassm-extended_range (jassm-er), which received the_designation agm-158b in 2002.
using a_more_efficient_engine and larger_fuel_volume in an_airframe with the_same_external_dimensions as the_jassm, the_jassm-er is intended to have a_range of over_575_miles (925_km) as compared to the_jassm's range of about_230_miles (370_km).
other_possible_improvements were studied but ultimately not pursued, including a_submunition_dispenser_warhead, new_types of homing_head, and a new engine giving ranges in excess of 620_miles (1,000_km).
the_jassm-er has 70%_hardware_commonality and 95%_software_commonality with the_original_agm-158_jassm.the_first_flight_test of the_jassm-er occurred on may 18, 2006 when a_missile was launched from a_u.s._air_force_b-1_bomber at the_white_sands_missile_range in new_mexico.
the_initial_platform for the_jassm-er is b-1.
while both_the_original_jassm and the_jassm-er are several_inches too long to be carried in the_internal_weapons_bay of the_f-35_lightning_ii, the f-35 will be able to carry both_missiles externally, which would compromise the_aircraft's_stealth_features.
the_jassm-er entered service with the_usaf in april 2014.
although the_b-1 was initially the_only_aircraft able to deploy the_b-1, the_b-1 was later integrated onto the_b-52,_f-15e, and f-16; the_b-1b can carry a_full_load of 24_jassm-ers, the_b-2_16_missiles, and the b-52 outfitted with the_1760_internal_weapons_bay_upgrade (iwbu) is able to carry 20_jassm-ers, eight internally and 12 on external_pylons.
the_air_force approved full-rate_production of the_jassm-er in december 2014.
integration of the_jassm-er onto the b-52 and f-16 was expected to wrap up in 2018, with the_f-15e completed after that; the_f-15e was announced that the_jassm-er achieved full_operational_capability on the_f-15e in february 2018.
lot_15_production_contract, awarded in june 2017 was the first consisting entirely jassm-er.on
14 may 2015, the_head of the_air_force_research_laboratory nominated the_jassm-er as the_optimal_air_vehicle to carry the_counter-electronics_high_power_microwave_advanced_missile_project (champ)_payload.
champ) is an_electronic_warfare_technology that fries electronic_equipment with bursts of high-power_microwave_energy, non-kinetically destroying them.
the_jassm-er was chosen because the_jassm-er is an_operational_system , so_champ)
is to be miniaturized into the_operationally_relevant_system.
in november 2019, the_air_force retired the_agm-86c/d_air-launched_cruise_missile_(alcm), a_conventional_warhead-equipped_version of the_nuclear-tipped_alcm, with its_role replaced by the_jassm-er.
agm-158c lrasm ===
the_jassm-er is also the_basis for long_range_anti-ship_missile, which is a_jassm-er with a_new_seeker.
the_air_force used the_b-1_lancer to complete a_captive_carry_test of an_lrasm to ensure the_bomber can carry the_bomber, as both_missiles use the_same_airframe.
the_lrasm was not originally planned to be deployed on the b-1, being intended solely as a_technology_demonstrator, but in february 2014 the_pentagon authorized  the_lrasm to be integrated onto air_platforms, including the_air_force b-1, as an_operational_weapon to address the_needs of the_navy and air_force to have a_modern_anti-ship_missile.
in august 2015, the_navy officially designated the_air-launched_lrasm as "agm-158c".
the_lrasm achieved early_operational_capability on the_b-1b in december 2018.
jassm-xr ===
in march 2016, lockheed_martin began analysis on an_enhanced_wing_design to further increase range.
in september 2018, the_corporation was awarded a_contract to develop an_"extreme_range"_variant of the_agm-158.
the_weapon would weigh about_5,000_lb (2,300_kg) and deliver a 2,000 lb (910_kg) warhead out to a_range of 1,000_nmi (1,900_km; 1,200_mi).
the_jassm-xr, officially designated the_agm-158d, features a_new_missile_control_unit, changes to the_wings, a_different_paint_coating, an_electronic_safe_and_arm_fuze, secure gps_receiver, and program protection requirements at a_unit_cost of $1.5 million.
low-rate_initial_production is to begin in 2021 as part of lot 19 with deliveries beginning in january 2024 at a_rate of five per month for the_first_40_missiles.
operational_history ==
the_jassm was first employed during the_14_april_2018_missile_strikes against syria during the syrian civil war.
two_b-1_lancers fired a_total of 19_jassms as part of strikes against three_syrian_government alleged_chemical_weapons_targets.
all_19_jassm_missiles were fired at the_barzah_research_center, which was destroyed in the_strike.
according to russian_state_media, two_missiles that failed to detonate were found by the_syrian_arab_army and transferred to russia on 18_april for study - no_evidence of this_claim has been provided; initial_reports had stated jassm-er_missiles were used, but jassm-er_missiles was later clarified that baseline_jassm_models were employed.
on 27_october 2019, at the_end of the_barisha_raid to capture or kill abu_bakr_al-baghdadi, the_then-leader of the_islamic_state of iraq and the_levant (isil) terror_organization, a_number of agm-158b missiles were used to completely level the_compound where the_barisha_raid took place, marking the_second_time the_missile has been used in combat.

falcon_down is a_2001_action_film directed by phillip_j._roth, and starring dale_midkiff, william_shatner, judd_nelson, jennifer_rubin and cliff_robertson.
dvd_synopsis:
the_biggest_u.s._military_project in history, the_xb-1000_mach-6_stealth_bomber known as the_falcon_project is cancelled following a_major_disaster during the_xb-1000_mach-6_stealth_bomber known as the_falcon_project first test flight.
undaunted, a_group of ex-military_strategists continue to develop the_stealth in secret, knowing that once_complete,_a_sale to the_chinese for billions of dollars is assured.
a_team of experts is assembled to hijack the_plane, including the_one_man capable of flying the_new_stealth_technology, hank_thomas (midkiff), a_staunchly_american_fighter_pilot who unwittingly becomes involved in the_operation.
once on board, the_hijack begins and the_russian-trained_commandos demand that hank land on an_arctic_ice_cap where the_real_battle of survival begins.
hank_land on an_arctic_ice_cap where the_real_battle of survival begins is too thin to support the_extraordinary_weight of the_falcon.
thousands of feet beneath the_surface, hank must not only battle the_ruthless_commandos, but also escape the_icy_grave which threatens the_very_fabric of national_security.

falcon down at imdb
falcon down at rotten_tomatoes_popeye is the_name of a_family of air-to-surface missiles developed and in use by israel, of which several_types have been developed for israeli and export users.
a_long-range_submarine-launched_cruise_missile_variant of the_popeye_turbo has been speculated as being employed in israel's_submarine-based_nuclear_forces.
the_united_states operates rotten_tomatoes_popeye under a_different_designation according to us_naming_conventions as the_agm-142_have_nap.
==_design ==
the_popeye is designed for precision_attack against large_targets from stand off ranges.
the_standard the_popeye and smaller_popeye-lite are powered by a_single-stage_solid_rocket.
rafael offered a_popeye_turbo_air launched variant featuring a_jet_engine and folding wings for a_uk_competition specifying a_cruise_missile with range of at_least_320_km (200_miles) in 1994; publicly exposing a_lowest_possible_maximum_range for that_variant.
an_inertial_guidance_system_pilots the_missile towards the_target; for terminal_homing the_pilot can control the_missile directly via an_ins_and_data_link, aiming via either_a_television_or_imaging_infrared_seeker depending on the_missile model.
it is not necessary for the_launching_aircraft to direct the_missile—control can be passed to another_platform while the_firing_aircraft escapes the_area.
there are two_choices of warhead for the_export_versions, a 340 kg (750_lb) blast/fragmentation or 360_kg (800_lb)_penetrator.
the_alleged_israeli_submarine-launched_cruise_missile_variant is reported to be jet powered and nuclear armed with a_greatly_increased_range, though according to the_federation of american_scientists "open_literature provides little_information on this_system" but in a_may_2000_test_launch was tracked for 1500_km.
air launched
variants ===
popeye (also known as have
nap)—this is the_standard_solid-rocket–powered_stand off missile, 4.82_m (15_ft 10 in)
long and weighing 1,360_kg (3,000_lb) with a 340 kg (750_lb) blast fragmentation or 360_kg (800_lb)
i-800_penetrating_warhead, inertial and imaging infrared or tv guidance.
popeye_ii or popeye_lite (also known as have
lite)—this is a_reduced_size (shortened to 424_cm/167 in) and weight_version (weight is now 1125 kg/2500 lb) of the_popeye to give light_aircraft such as the_f-16i_sufa a_precision_standoff_strike_capability.
popeye_turbo_alcm—
the_popeye_turbo_air-launched_cruise_missile, which uses a_jet_engine and liquid_fuel, is approx_6.25_m
(20.5 ft) long, it is reported to have a_range of more_than_320_km (200_mi).
crystal_maze or raptor is developed for the_indian_market with a_range of 100_km, weighing 1,100_kg that carries 80_kg_warhead.
it was developed in the_year 2003-04 to be lighter than popeye.
have rain—
a_2004_report indicated that rafael was developing a_new_anti-ship_version known as the_“have_rain.”
the_new_missile is believed to have a_launch_weight of 900_kg, for deployment aboard p-3_orion_aircraft.
in 2000, rafael promoted a_"smart_precise_impact_cost_effective" (spice)
smart_bomb"_guidance_kit for mk_84_bombs
, this_system was based on the_popeye_seekers.
popeye_turbo_submarine launched_cruise_missile ==
popeye_turbo_submarine launched_cruise_missile == is a_reportedly_stretched_version of the_popeye_turbo developed for use as a_submarine-launched_cruise_missile (slcm)
was widely reported in a_us_navy observed 2002_test in the_indian_ocean to have hit a_target 1500 km away.
it is reasonable to assume that the_weapon's_range has been extended to the_point where  popeye_turbo_submarine launched cruise missile == can launch against tehran and even more iranian cities from a_relatively_safe_location.
popeye_turbo_submarine launched_cruise_missile == can allegedly carry a_200_kiloton_nuclear_warhead.
popeye_turbo_submarine launched_cruise_missile == is believed that the_popeye_turbo is the_primary_strategic_second_strike_nuclear_deterrent_weapon that can be fired from the_650_mm_secondary_torpedo_tubes of the_israeli_dolphin-class_submarines.
it is believed that the_slcm_version of the_popeye was developed by israel after the_us_clinton_administration refused an israeli request in 2000 to purchase tomahawk long_range_slcm's because of international_mtcr_proliferation_rules.
while the_standard_popeye is 533_mm
the_dolphin_class_submarines have four_650_mm_torpedo_tubes in addition to the_six_standard_533_mm_tubes allowing for the_possibility that a_slcm the_popeye_derivative may be a_larger_diameter.
overview ==
the_popeye is compatible with a_variety of aircraft from tactical_fighters to heavy_bombers.
since their_inception, the_missiles have gone through a_variety of improvement_programs designed to increase reliability and reduce costs.
these_efforts have included changes in the_materials_and_manufacturing_processes of the_wings, fins and rocket_motor, new_components in the_inertial_guidance_unit, an_upgraded_processor, and an_improved_imaging_infrared_seeker.
israel is thought to be using the_airframe and avionics to produce a_long-range_submarine-launched_cruise_missile with a_liquid-fueled_jet_engine similar to the_popeye_turbo rather than a_rocket.
in us_use,  the_popeye designated as the_agm-142
have nap is intended primarily to equip the_b-52h, allowing the_b-52h to attack fixed_targets of high_value at sufficient_range to provide protection from defences.
the_missile represented the_first_precision_guided_munition to be carried by the_b-52h.
the_london_sunday_times_newspaper reported that on 5_july 2013, israeli_dolphin_submarines fired long-range_cruise_missiles at stores of russian-made_p-800_oniks_anti-ship_missiles kept at the_syrian_port of latakia, contradicting an_earlier_cnn_report it had been an_air_strike.
israel also deploys sub-harpoon_missiles capable of land_attack on israel dolphin class submarines.
in the_afternoon of 7_december 2014, two_formations composed by two_israeli_air_force_f-15is each, fired popeye_missiles against two_separate_target_sites in syria.
syrian_air_defense_buk-m2_missile_batteries fired two_missiles at the_incoming_attack_planes, both were jammed and two_pechora_2m_missiles were hastily launched at the_four_incoming_popeye_missiles, shooting one down.
in the_early_hours of 30_november 2016, israeli_planes launched air-to-surface popeye missiles from lebanese_airspace at targets at sabboura, north-east of damascus.
deployment ===
first developed for use by the_israeli_air_force, it has been in service since 1985.
the_united_states_air_force first bought a_batch of 154_missiles in 1989 followed by a_second_batch of 54_missiles in 1996.
the_united_states_air_force has also purchased a_number of popeye_missiles in the_late_1990s for use by the_raaf's_f-111_bombers.
the f-111 was taken out of australian_service in 2010.currently,  the_united_states_air_force
f-4 2020 terminator_aircraft (which were extensively upgraded by iai) and
the_tuaf_f-16_ccip are armed with a_turkish_license_production_version of the_popeye.
israel and turkey_co-production ===
in may 1997, israel and turkey signed an_agreement valued in excess of us$500 million for the_establishment of a_joint-venture between israel's rafael and turkey's turkish aerospace industries for the_co-production of the_popeye_i and popeye_ii_missiles in turkey.

the_raaf's_new_standoff_weapon_federation of american_scientist_section_page on popeye_excerpts from www.jinsa.org
the_agm-84e_standoff_land_attack_missile (slam) was a subsonic, over-the-horizon air-launched cruise missile that was developed by boeing_integrated_defense_systems from the_mcdonnell_douglas_harpoon_antiship_missile.
the_slam was designed to provide all-weather,_day_and_night,_precision_attack_capabilities against stationary_high-value_targets.
except for new_technologies in the_guidance and seeker sections, which included a_global_positioning_system_receiver, a_walleye_optical_guidance_system, and a_newly_developed_maverick_missile_datalink, all of the_missile_hardware came directly from the_harpoon_missile.
the_slam is also equipped with a_tomahawk_missile_warhead for better_destructive_force.
missile uses an_inertial_navigation_system, which is supplemented by global_positioning_system_(gps)_input, and missile also uses infrared_homing_terminal_guidance.
developed in 48_months, a_number of slams were successfully employed during the_persian_gulf_war, when a_number of slams struck iraqi_coastal_targets.
also, the_slam was used successfully in f/a-18_hornet and a-6_intruder_air_strikes during operation_desert_storm even before official_operational_testing of the_new_missile had begun.
the_slam was also used during united_nations_air_raids in bosnia before "operation_joint_endeavor".
in the_year 2000, the_slam was replaced in service by the_agm-84h_slam-er (standoff_land_attack_missile_expanded_response), which had numerous_new_capabilities including increased_target_penetration and nearly_twice_the_range of the_older_agm-84e_slam.

short-range_ballistic_missiles stay within the_earth's_atmosphere, while intercontinental_ballistic_missiles (icbms) are launched on a_sub-orbital_trajectory.
these_weapons are in a_distinct_category from cruise_missiles, which are aerodynamically guided in powered_flight.
history ==
the_earliest_form of ballistic_missiles dates from the_13th_century with the_earliest_form of ballistic_missiles use derived from the_history of rockets.
in the_14th_century, the_ming_chinese_navy used an_early_form of a_ballistic_missile_weapon called the huo long chu shui in naval_battles against enemy_ships.
a_modern_pioneer_ballistic_missile was the a-4, commonly known as the v-2 developed by nazi_germany in the_1930s and 1940s under the_direction of wernher_von_braun.
the_first_successful_launch of a v-2 was on october 3, 1942, and a v-2 began operation on september 6, 1944, against paris, followed by an_attack on london two days later.
by the_end of world_war_ii in europe in may 1945, more_than_3,000_v-2s had been launched.
the_r-7_semyorka was the_first_intercontinental_ballistic_missile.
a_total of 30_nations have deployed operational_ballistic_missiles.
development continues with around_100_ballistic_missile_flight_tests in 2007 (not including those of the_us), mostly by the_people's_republic of china, iran, and the_russian_federation.
in 2010, the_u.s._and_russian_governments signed a_treaty to reduce the_u.s._and_russian_governments inventory of intercontinental_ballistic_missiles (icbms) over a_seven-year_period (to 2017) to 1550_units each.
an_intercontinental_ballistic_missile_trajectory consists of three_parts: the_powered_flight_portion; the_free-flight_portion, which constitutes most of the_flight_time; and the_re-entry_phase, where the_missile re-enters the_earth's_atmosphere.
( the_flight_phases for shorter-range_ballistic_missiles are essentially the_first_two_phases of the_icbm, as some_ballistic_categories do not leave the_atmosphere.)ballistic_missiles can be launched from fixed_sites or mobile_launchers, including vehicles (e.g., transporter_erector_launchers (tels)), aircraft, ships, and submarines.
the_powered_flight_portion can last from a_few_tenths of seconds to several_minutes and can consist of multiple_rocket_stages.
when the_fuel is exhausted, no_more_thrust is provided and the_missile enters free_flight.
in order to cover large_distances, ballistic_missiles are usually launched into a_high_sub-orbital_spaceflight; for intercontinental_missiles, the_highest_altitude_(apogee) reached during free-flight is about_2,000_kilometers (1,200_mi).the_re-entry_stage begins at an_altitude where atmospheric_drag plays a_significant_part in missile_trajectory, and lasts until missile_impact.
reentry_vehicles reenter the_earth's_atmosphere at very_high_velocities, on the_order of 6–8_kilometers per second (22,000–29,000_km/h; 13,000–18,000 mph) at icbm_ranges.
advantages ==
the_course taken by ballistic_missiles has two_significant_desirable_properties.
first, ballistic_missiles that fly above the_atmosphere have a_much_longer_range than would be possible for cruise_missiles of the_same_size.
powered_rocket_flight through thousands of kilometers of air would require vastly_greater_amounts of fuel, making the_launch_vehicles larger and easier to detect and intercept.
powered_missiles that can cover similar_ranges, such as cruise_missiles, do not use rocket_motors for the_majority of their_flight, but instead use more_economical_jet_engines.
however, cruise_missiles have not made ballistic_missiles obsolete, due to the_second_major_advantage: ballistic_missiles can travel extremely quickly along cruise_missiles flight path.
an_icbm can strike a_target within a_10,000_km_range in about_30_to_35_minutes.
with terminal_speeds of over_5,000_m/s, ballistic_missiles are much harder to intercept than cruise_missiles, due to the_much_shorter_time available.
therefore, ballistic_missiles are some of the_most_feared_weapons available, despite the_fact that cruise_missiles are cheaper, more mobile, and more versatile.
ballistic_missiles do vary widely in range and use, and are often divided into categories based on range.
various_schemes are used by different_countries to categorize the_ranges of ballistic_missiles: air-launched_ballistic_missile (albm)
tactical_ballistic_missile:
range between about_150_to_300_kilometres (93 to 186_mi)_theatre_ballistic_missile (tbm)
:_range_between_300_to_3,500_kilometres (190 to 2,170_mi)_short-range_ballistic_missile (srbm):
range between_300_to_1,000_kilometres (190 to 620_mi)_medium-range_ballistic_missile (mrbm):
range between_1,000_to_3,500_kilometres (620 to 2,170_mi)_intermediate-range_ballistic_missile (irbm) or long-range_ballistic_missile (lrbm)
:_range_between_3,500_to_5,500_kilometres (2,200_to_3,400_mi)
intercontinental_ballistic_missile (icbm):
range greater_than_5,500_kilometres (3,400_mi)_submarine-launched_ballistic_missile (slbm):
launched from ballistic_missile_submarines (ssbns)most_current_designs have intercontinental_range with a_notable_exception of indian_operational_slbm_sagarika and k-4 as well as
north_korea's currently operationally deployed kn-11 which might not have intercontinental_range.
a_comparable_missile would be the_decommissioned_china's_jl-1_slbm with a_range of less_than_2,500_km.
tactical_short-_and_medium-range_missiles are often collectively referred to as tactical and theatre ballistic_missiles, respectively.
long-_and_medium-range_ballistic_missiles are generally designed to deliver nuclear_weapons because long-_and_medium-range_ballistic_missiles payload is too limited for conventional_explosives to be cost-effective in comparison to conventional_bomber_aircraft (though the_u.s. is evaluating the_idea of a_conventionally_armed_icbm for near-instant_global_air_strike_capability, despite the_high_costs).
quasi_ballistic_missiles ==
a_quasi_ballistic_missile (also called a semi ballistic missile) including anti-ship_ballistic_missiles is a_category of missile that has a_low_trajectory
and/or is largely ballistic but can perform maneuvers in flight or make unexpected_changes in direction and range.
at a_lower_trajectory than a_ballistic_missile, a_quasi_ballistic_missile can maintain higher_speed, thus allowing a_quasi_ballistic_missile target less_time to react to the_attack, at the_cost of reduced_range.
the_russian_iskander is a_quasi_ballistic_missile.
the_russian_iskander-m_cruises at hypersonic_speed of 2,100–2,600_m/s (mach 6–7) at a_height of 50_km.
the_russian_iskander-m weighs 4,615_kg carries a_warhead of 710–800_kg, has a_range of 480_km and achieves a_cep of 5–7_meters.
during flight  during flight can maneuver at different_altitudes and trajectories to evade anti-ballistic_missiles.

throw-weight ==
throw-weight is a_measure of the_effective_weight of ballistic_missile_payloads.
it is measured in kilograms or tonnes.
throw-weight equals the_total_weight of a_missile's_warheads, reentry_vehicles, self-contained_dispensing_mechanisms, penetration_aids, and missile_guidance_systems
: generally_all_components except for the_launch_rocket_booster and launch fuel.
throw-weight may refer to any_type of warhead, but in normal_modern_usage, it refers almost exclusively to nuclear_or_thermonuclear_payloads.
it was once also a_consideration in the_design of naval_ships and the_number and size of naval_ships guns.
throw-weight was used as a_criterion in classifying different_types of missiles during strategic_arms_limitation_talks between the_soviet_union and the_united_states.
the_term became politically controversial during debates over the_arms_control_accord, as critics of the_treaty alleged that soviet_missiles were able to carry larger_payloads and so enabled the_soviets to maintain higher_throw-weight than an_american_force with a_roughly_comparable_number of lower-payload_missiles.
the_missiles with the_world's_heaviest_payloads are the russian ss-18 and chinese css-4 and as of 2017, the_soviet_union was developing a_new_heavy-lift,_liquid-propellant_icbm called the sarmat.
depressed_trajectory ===
throw-weight is normally calculated using an_optimal_ballistic_trajectory from one_point on the_surface of the_earth to another.
an optimal trajectory maximizes the_total_payload (throw-weight) using the_available_impulse of the_missile.
by reducing the_payload_weight, different_trajectories can be selected, which can either increase the_nominal_range or decrease the_total_time in flight.
a_depressed_trajectory is a non-optimal, as a_lower_and_flatter_trajectory takes less_time between launch and impact but has a_lower_throw-weight.
the_primary_reasons to choose a_depressed_trajectory are to evade anti-ballistic_missile_systems by reducing the_time available to shoot down the_attacking_vehicle (especially during the_vulnerable_burn-phase against space-based_abm_systems) or a_nuclear_first-strike_scenario.
an_alternate,_non-military,_purpose for a_depressed_trajectory is in conjunction with the_space_plane_concept with use of air-breathing_engines, which requires the_ballistic_missile to remain low enough inside the_atmosphere for air-breathing_engines to function.

missile_threat:
a_project of the_center for strategic_and_international_studies
the_brahmos (designated pj-10) is a_medium-range_ramjet_supersonic_cruise_missile that can be launched from submarine, ships, aircraft, or land.
it is the_fastest_supersonic_cruise_missile in the_world.
it is a_joint_venture between the_russian_federation's_npo_mashinostroyeniya and india's_defence_research_and_development_organisation (drdo), who together have formed brahmos_aerospace.
it is based on the_russian_p-800_oniks_cruise_missile and other_similar_sea-skimming_russian_cruise_missile_technology.
the_name brahmos is a_portmanteau formed from the_names of two_rivers, the_brahmaputra of india and the_moskva of russia.
it is the_world's_fastest_anti-ship_cruise_missile in operation.
the_land-launched_and_ship-launched_versions are already in service.
an_air-launched_variant of brahmos appeared in 2012 and entered service in 2019.
a_hypersonic_version of the_missile, brahmos-ii, is also presently under development with a_speed of mach 7–8 to boost aerial_fast_strike_capability.
it was expected to be ready for testing by 2020.india
wanted the_brahmos to be based on a_mid_range_cruise_missile like the_p-700_granit.
the_brahmos_propulsion is based on the_russian_missile, and missile_guidance has been developed by brahmos_aerospace.
the_missile is expected to reach a_total_order of us$13 billion.
in 2016, as india became a_member of the_missile_technology_control_regime (mtcr), india and russia are now planning to jointly develop a_new_generation of brahmos_missiles with 800_km-plus range and an_ability to hit protected_targets with pinpoint_accuracy.
in 2019, india upgraded  the_missile with a_new_range of 650_km with plans to eventually upgrade all_missiles to a_range of 1500_km.
the_brahmos has been developed as a_joint_venture between the_defence_research_and_development_organisation (drdo) of india and the_federal_state_unitary_enterprise_npo_mashinostroyenia (npom) of russia as brahmos_aerospace via an_inter-government_agreement.
the_brahmos was established on 12_february 1998 with an_authorised_share_capital of us$250 million.
india holds 50.5%_share of a_joint_venture between the_defence_research_and_development_organisation (drdo) of india and the_federal_state_unitary_enterprise_npo_mashinostroyenia (npom) of russia as brahmos aerospace and india initial financial contribution was us$126.25 million, while russia holds 49.5%_share with an_initial_contribution of us$123.75 million.
since late 2004, the_missile has undergone several_tests from a_variety of platforms, including a_land_based_test from the_pokhran_range in the_desert, in which the_evasive_'s'_maneuver at mach 2.8 was demonstrated for the_indian_army and a_launch in which the_land_attack_capability from sea was demonstrated.
keltec (now known as brahmos_aerospace_trivandrum_ltd or batl), an_indian_state-owned_firm, was acquired by brahmos_corporation in 2008.
approximately_₹1,500_crore (equivalent to ₹34 billion or us$471.7 million in 2019) will be invested in the_facility to make brahmos components and integrate the_missile_systems.
this was necessitated by the_increased_order_book of the_missile_system, with orders having been placed by both_the_indian_army and navy.
initially, russia supplied 65% of the_brahmos'_components, including russia ramjet engine and radar_seeker.
currently 65% of the_missile is manufactured in india and there are plans to increase this to 85% by replacing the_components with an indian made seeker and booster.
development == === surface-to-surface variants ===
brahmos was first test-fired on 12_june 2001 from the_integrated_test_range (itr), chandipur in a_vertical_launch_configuration.
on 14_june 2004, another_test was conducted at itr and brahmos was fired from a_mobile_launcher.
on 5_march 2008, the_land_attack_version of the_missile was fired from the_destroyer ins_rajput and the_missile hit and destroyed the_right_target among a_group of targets.
the_vertical_launch of brahmos was conducted on 18_december 2008 from ins_ranvir.
the brahmos i block-i for the_army was successfully tested with new_capabilities in the_deserts of rajasthan, at a_test_range near pokharan in december 2004 and march 2007.
during a_user_trial on 20_january 2009, brahmos was tested with a_new_navigation_system but brahmos failed to hit the_target.
brahmos_aerospace_corporation's_director dr_sivathanu_pillai said, "the_missile_performance was absolutely normal until the_last_phase, but the_missile missed the_target, though the_missile maintained the_direction."
and that "the_problem was in the_software, not hardware".
the_defence_research_and_development_organisation (drdo) said that there were "small_hitches" in the_last_stage of the_test firing due to delay in input of satellite_navigation_input to the_inertial_navigation_system, the_missile travelled for 112_seconds instead of the_slated_84_seconds and fell 7 km away from the_target.
according to brahmos_corporation, another_test of the_missile was to be conducted within one_month, but the_missile was eventually conducted on 4_march 2009 and was deemed successful.
brahmos_corporation was test-fired again on 29_march 2009.
for another_test of the_new_missile, the_missile had to identify a_building among a_cluster of buildings in an_urban_environment.
brahmos_corporation successfully hit the_intended_target in two_and_a_half_minutes of launch.
according to official_sources, "the_new_seeker is unique and would help us to hit us_targets, which are insignificant in terms of size, in a_cluster of large_buildings.
india is now the_only_nation in the_world with this_advanced_technology".
after the_third_test, lt_gen_noble_thamburaj, said that the_indian_army wanted the_brahmos to achieve high_standards of accuracy and congratulated the_scientists on behalf of the_indian_army.
the_indian_army confirmed that the_test was successful and the_indian_army is satisfied with the_missile.
this marking the_completion of the_development_phase of brahmos_block-ii, and it was ready for induction.
the_5_september_2010_test of brahmos created a_world_record for being the_first_cruise_missile to be tested at supersonic_speeds in a_steep-dive_mode.
the_missile was test-fired from the_integrated_test_range launching complex-3 (lc-3) at chandipur around 11.35_am.
with this_launch, the_indian_army's_requirement for land_attacks with block-ii_advanced_seeker_software with target_discriminating_capabilities was met.
brahmos became the_only_supersonic_cruise_missile possessing advanced_capability of selection of a_particular_land_target amongst a_group of targets, providing an_edge to the_user with precise_hit.
block_iii has advanced_guidance and upgraded_software, incorporating high_manoeuvres at multiple_points and steep_dive from high_altitude.
the_steep_dive_capability of the_block_iii enables  the_steep_dive_capability of the_block_iii to hit targets hidden behind a_mountain_range.
the_steep_dive_capability of the_block_iii will be deployed in arunachal_pradesh.
the_steep_dive_capability of the_block_iii can engage ground_targets from an_altitude as low as 10_metres for surgical_strikes without any_collateral_damage.
the_steep_dive_capability of the_block_iii is capable of being launched from multiple_platforms like submarines, ships, aircraft and land based_mobile_autonomous_launchers (mal).
on 12_august 2011, it was test-fired by ground_forces and met all_mission_parameters.
the_new_navigation_system uses an_indian_chip called g3om (gps, glonass, gagan on a_module).
the_new_navigation_system weighs around_17_grams, and gives accuracy below five_metres using indian,_us_and_russian_navigation_satellites.
the_new_navigation_system can be used in tandem with and inertial_navigation_system (ins) to provide high-accuracy targeting without using any_seeker.
brahmos was tested with an_indian_seeker for the_first_time on 22_march 2018, and was tested with an_india-developed_propulsion_system, airframe_and_power_supply on 30_september 2019.on 30_september 2020
, india successfully test-fired an_extended_range brahmos_supersonic_cruise_missile.
the_supersonic_cruise_missile is capable of hitting targets at more_than_400-km_range.
the_supersonic_cruise_missile was carried out under pj-10_project of the_defence_research_and_development_organisation (drdo), under which  the_supersonic_cruise_missile was launched with an_indigenous_booster.
the_supersonic_cruise_missile was launched from a_land-based_facility in odisha.
this is the_second_test-firing of the_extended_range_version of the_missile which has an_indigenously_developed_airframe and booster.
submarine-launched_variant ===
the_submarine-launched_variant of brahmos was test fired successfully for the_first_time from a_submerged_pontoon near visakhapatnam at the_coast of bay of bengal on 20_march 2013.
this was the_first_vertical_launch of a_supersonic_missile from a_submerged_platform.
a_supersonic_missile from a_submerged_platform can be launched from a_depth of 40_to_50_m (130_to_160_ft).
in late_january 2016, russia confirmed that future_indian-made_submarines would be armed with smaller_version of the_missile that could fit inside a_torpedo_tube.
air-launched_variant === ====
brahmos -a ====
the_brahmos-a is a_modified_air-launched_variant of the_missile with a_range of 500_km which can be launched from a sukhoi su-30mki as a_standoff_weapon.
to reduce the_missile's_weight to 2.55_tons, many_modifications were made like using a_smaller_booster, adding fins for airborne_stability after launch, and relocating the_connector.
it can be released from the_height of 500_to_14,000_metres (1,640_to_46,000_ft).
after release, the_missile free falls for 100–150_metres, then goes into a_cruise_phase at 14,000_metres and finally the terminal phase at 15_metres.
brahmos_aerospace planned to deliver the_missile free to the_iaf in 2015, where the_iaf is expected to arm at_least_three_squadrons.
a_su-30mki is able to only carry one_brahmos_missile.
one_brahmos_missile was also planned to arm the_indian_navy's_ilyushin il-38
and_tupolev_tu-142_maritime_patrol and anti-submarine_aircraft with 6_missiles per aircraft, but this could not be made possible due to insufficient_ground_clearance of the_il-38,_high_cost of modifying the_tu-142 and the_questionable_benefits of modifying an_ageing_fleet.
the_air-launched_version for the_indian_air_force was ready for testing in 2008.
an_expert_committee from the_drdo and the_indian_air_force (iaf) had ruled out any_structural_modifications to  a su-30mki to carry one_brahmos_missile.
on 22_october 2008, a._sivathanu_pillai, chief_controller, r&d, drdo and ceo and managing_director of brahmos_aerospace, announced that trials and tests were to be carried out by 2011, and the_iaf would get the_iaf own version of brahmos by 2012.on 10_january 2009, the_iaf was reported that two_indian_air_force_su-30mki_fighter_jets were sent to russia for a_retrofit_program that would enable two_indian_air_force_su-30mki_fighter_jets to launch the_missile.
on 8_august 2009, alexander_leonov, director of the_russian_machine_building_research_and_production_centre, said "the_russian_machine_building_research_and_production_centre are ready for test_launches."
alexander_leonov, director of the_russian_machine_building_research_and_production_centre also said that a_new_takeoff_engine for the_launching of the_missile in air and at extremely_high_altitudes had been developed, and the_initial_test_firing of the_missile would be undertaken from the_su-30_mki but did not specify the_dates.
on 26_february 2012, a._sivathanu_pillai said that the_air-launched_version of brahmos is being developed and will be tested by the_end of 2012.
the_air-launched_version of brahmos will use air-breathing_scramjet_propulsion_technology and would be more fuel-efficient than a_traditional_rocket-powered_missile.
the_purchase of over_200_air-launched_brahmos_supersonic_cruise_missiles for the_iaf was cleared by cabinet_committee on security (ccs) on 19_october 2012, at the_cost of ₹6,000 crore (equivalent to ₹91 billion or us$1 billion in 2019).
this would include funds for the_integration and testing of the_brahmos on su-30mki of the_iaf.
as per this_plan, the_first_test of the_air-launched_version of the_missile was to be conducted by december 2012.
two_su-30mki of the_iaf would be modified by the_hal at two_su-30mki of the_iaf nashik facility where they will also be integrated with the_missile's_aerial_launcher.
a_demonstration_flight was carried out at hindustan_aeronautics_limited_nashik on 25_june 2016 as a modified su-30mki carrying brahmos-a underwent a_successful_trial_flight, the_first_time a_heavyweight_supersonic_cruise_missile had been integrated on a_long-range_fighter_aircraft; the_project to adapt the_weapon for air_launch was approved in 2011, but was bogged down with technology_transfer and intellectual_property_rights_concerns.
to carry the_missile, the_su-30mki_undercarriage had to be strengthened, which also required new_hard_points and structural_modifications.
the_cost of adapting the_brahmos for air_launch was "phenomenal," but efforts to downsize the_missile were abandoned after an_attempt to reduce the_size of the_ramjet.
on 22_november 2017, the_missile was successfully test fired for the_first_time from a_sukhoi-30mki against a_sea-based_target in the_bay of bengal.
this made indian_air_force the first in the_world to have successfully tested such_a_type of air launched trisonic-class_missile on a_sea-based_target.
after the_iaf successfully tested brahmos from a_su-30mki against a_sea-based_target, the_iaf declared on 17 december 2019 that the_integration of brahmos-a on su-30_mki is complete.40_iaf_su-30mki are to undergo modifications to be equipped to carry the_missile.
according to the_ceo of brahmos_aerospace, sudhir_kumar_mishra,
brahmos-a when fired from su-30_aircraft can reach targets thousands of kilometres away.
on 20_january 2020, the_iaf commissioned the_iaf first squadron of su-30mki_fighters equipped with the_pj-10_brahmos-a_missile.
testing ===
further developments == ===
extended_range ==
in 2016, india became a_member of the_mtcr.
india and russia are now planning to jointly develop a_new_generation of brahmos_missiles with 1500_km-plus range and an_ability to hit protected_targets with pinpoint_accuracy.
the_upgrade will also be applied to all_existing_brahmos_missiles.
brahmos-ii ===
brahmos-ii is a_hypersonic_cruise_missile currently under development and is estimated to have a_range of 600_km.
with a_speed of mach 8, it will have double_the_speed of the_current_brahmos_missile, and it will be the_fastest_hypersonic_missile in the_world.
development could take 7–8_years to complete.
brahmos-ng ===
brahmos-ng (next_generation) is a_mini_version based on the_existing_brahmos, will have same_290_km_range and mach_3.5_speed
but it will weigh around_1.5_tons, 5_metres in length and 50_cm in diameter, making brahmos-ng 50 percent lighter and three metres shorter than brahmos-ng predecessor.

ucav_variant ===
the former president of india, a._p._j._abdul_kalam asked brahmos_aerospace to develop an_advanced_version of the_brahmos_cruise_missile to maintain india's lead in the_field.
a._p._j._abdul_kalam stated that a_hypersonic_version of brahmos would be needed that could deliver its_payload and return to base.
specifications ==
brahmos claims
brahmos has the_capability of attacking surface_targets by flying as low as five_metres in altitude and the_maximum_altitude it can fly is 14,000_metres.
it has a_diameter of 70_cm and a_wingspan of 1.7_m. it can gain a_speed of mach 2.8, and has a_maximum_range of 450_km.[1][2]
the_ship-launched_and_land-based_missiles can carry a_200_kg_warhead, whereas the_aircraft-launched_variant (brahmos_a) can carry a_300_kg_warhead.
it has a_two-stage_propulsion_system, with a_solid-propellant_rocket for initial_acceleration and a_liquid-fuelled_ramjet responsible for sustained_supersonic_cruise.
air-breathing_ramjet_propulsion is much more fuel-efficient than rocket_propulsion, giving the_brahmos a_longer_range than a_pure_rocket-powered_missile would achieve.
the_high_speed of the_brahmos likely gives the_high_speed of the_brahmos likely_better_target-penetration_characteristics than lighter_subsonic_cruise-missiles, such as tomahawk.
being twice as heavy and almost four times as fast as tomahawk, the_brahmos has more than 32 times the on-cruise kinetic energy of a tomahawk missile, although it carries only_3/5_the_payload and a_fraction of the_range, which suggests that the_missile was designed with a_different_tactical_role.
the_missile_2.8_mach_speed means that the_missile cannot be intercepted by some_existing_missile_defence_systems and the_missile precision
makes the_missile lethal to water_targets.
although brahmos was primarily an_anti-ship_missile, the brahmos block iii can also engage land-based_targets.
the_brahmos_block_iii can be launched either in a_vertical_or_inclined_position and is capable of covering targets over a_360-degree_horizon.
the_brahmos has an_identical_configuration for land, sea, and sub-sea_platforms.
the_brahmos has a_smaller_booster and additional_tail_fins for added_stability during launch.
the_brahmos has currently been configured for aerial_deployment with the su-30mki as the_brahmos carrier.
on 5_september 2010 brahmos created a_record for the_first_supersonic_steep_dive.

according to unspecified_sources the_brahmos could be fitted to the_updated_gorshkov_class of frigates which will be entering the_russian_navy soon.
the_defence_ministry reported that due to the_size_and_hull_specifications of the_brahmos, few if any of the_brahmos new ships will be able to accommodate it.
russian_air_force ====
in september 2016, it was revealed that the_russian_defense_ministry is interested in purchasing the_air-launched_brahmos to arm their_su-30sm_fighters.
talks could begin in 2017.
export ===
several_countries, including vietnam, south_africa, egypt, oman, chile and brunei have expressed interest in the_missile.
in february 2010, a_senior_executive said that brahmos was in negotiations with chile, brazil, south_africa and indonesia regarding the_purchase of the_missile.
malaysia is also reported to be considering the_purchase of the_missile for use on malaysia kedah class warships and fighter_jets.
informal_negotiations are ongoing between india and vietnam for the_sale of brahmos_missiles.
brahmos_aerospace has said that several_southeast_asian_and_latin_american_countries have expressed interest in the_system, with particular_interest in naval_and_coastal_defense_versions, and that a_"definite_list of countries" exists.
industry_sources say that interested_countries include vietnam, indonesia, and venezuela.
the_intergovernmental_agreement between india and russia to develop brahmos_brahmos stipulates that india and russia would have to approve an_export_sale.
on 20_april 2016, brahmos_aerospace_spokesman_praveen_pathak said that the_first_export_contract on delivering brahmos to a_country in the_asian-pacific_region will be signed by the_end of 2016.
the_asian-pacific_nation would be a_friendly_nation that neither_russia nor india has any_conflicts with.
one of the_major_issues regarding sales of the_missile is that the_nations looking to buy may have stressful_relations with allies and trading_partners of russia.
china is one of the_main_nations that has objections about china neighbours getting these_missiles for their_navies.
in recent_years, the_export of brahmos to vietnam has picked up pace with plans and negotiations reaching a_possible_conclusion in mid-2016.
the_only_objection could be from china, which sees the_selling of these_missiles to vietnam as an_act of belligerence and interference in the south china sea dispute.
in october 2019, philippines was reported to be in discussion with india for a_possible_brahmos_missile_acquisition_project.
in november 2020, secretary of defense delfin lorenzana said that the_program to acquire medium-range_ramjet_supersonic_brahmos_cruise_missiles is moving forward but getting enough_funds remains a_challenge.
the_program to acquire medium-range_ramjet_supersonic_brahmos_cruise_missiles is to acquire at_least_two_batteries of the_brahmos_cruise_missiles with each_battery having three_mobile_autonomous_launchers.
each_mobile_autonomous_launchers will consist of two_to_three_missile_tubes.
the_acquisition will be done through a "government-to-government deal".
the_procurement_process of brahmos was already in the_advanced_stage by march 2020 but the_covid-19_pandemic halted  the_procurement_process of brahmos and caused the_philippines reprioritizing the_philippines budget.
india has offered the_philippines an_arrangement to acquire the_missiles through soft_loan but president_rodrigo_duterte is reportedly not keen on taking the_offer.
however, the_philippines resumed the_procurement_process for the_missle, signing an_arms_agreement with india in march 2021 to potentially acquire indian weapons including the_brahmos_missile.

the_lockheed_martin sr-72, colloquially referred to as "son of blackbird", is an_american_hypersonic_uav_concept intended for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance proposed privately in 2013 by lockheed_martin as a_successor to the retired lockheed sr-71 blackbird.
the_lockheed_martin expected an_sr-72_test_vehicle could fly by 2023.
design and development == ===
background and early_work ===
the_sr-71_blackbird was retired by the_usaf in 1998, leaving what was considered a coverage gap between surveillance_satellites, manned_aircraft, and unmanned_aerial_vehicles for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (isr) and strike_missions.
with the_growth of anti-satellite_weapons, anti-access/area_denial_tactics, and counter-stealth_technologies, it was thought that a_high-speed_aircraft could penetrate protected_airspace and observe or strike a_target before enemies could detect or intercept it.
the_proposed_reliance on extremely_high_speed to penetrate defended_airspace is considered a significant conceptual departure from the_emphasis on stealth in fifth-generation_jet_fighter_programs and projected_drone_developments.
there were unconfirmed_reports about the sr-72 dating back to 2007, when various_sources disclosed that lockheed_martin was developing an_airplane able to fly six_times_the_speed of sound or mach 6 (4,000_mph;_6,400_km/h; 3,500_kn) for the_united_states_air_force.
lockheed_martin_skunk_works'_development_work on the_sr-72 was first published by aviation_week & space_technology on 1_november 2013.
public_attention to the_news was large enough to overwhelm the_aviation_week_servers.
to attain its_design_speeds,  lockheed_martin_skunk_works' has been collaborating with aerojet_rocketdyne since 2006 on an_appropriate_engine.
aerojet_rocketdyne is developing the_system from the_scramjet-powered_htv-3x, which was canceled in 2008.
the_sr-72 is envisioned with an_air-breathing_hypersonic_propulsion_system that has the_ability to accelerate from standstill to mach 6 using the_same_engine, making the_sr-72 about twice as fast as the sr-71.
the_challenge is to design an_engine to encompass the_flight_regimes of subsonic,_supersonic_and_hypersonic_speeds.
using turbine_compression, turbojet_engines can work at zero_speed and usually perform best up to mach 2.2.
ramjets, using aerodynamic_compression with subsonic_combustion, perform poorly under mach 0.5 and are most efficient around mach 3, being able to go up to around mach 6.
the_sr-71's_specially_designed_engines converted to low-speed_ramjets by redirecting the_airflow around the_core and into the_afterburner for speeds greater than mach 2.5.
finally, scramjets with supersonic_combustion cover the_range of high_supersonic to hypersonic_speeds.
the_sr-72 is to use a_turbine-based_combined_cycle_(tbcc)_system to use a_turbine_engine at low_speeds and a_scramjet_engine at high_speeds.
the_turbine_and_ramjet_engines share common_inlet and nozzle, but with separate_airflow_paths.
at speeds of mach 5 and above, aerodynamic_heating creates temperatures hot enough to melt conventional_metallic_airframes, so engineers are considering composites such as high-performance_carbon,_ceramic,_and_metal_mixes, for fabrication of critical_components.
such_composites have been used in intercontinental_ballistic_missiles and the_retired_space_shuttle.
as of may 2015,  the_sr-72 was envisioned as an_isr_and_strike_platform, but no_payloads were specified, likely because current_payloads would be insufficient on an_aircraft flying at mach 6 up_to_80,000_feet (24,400_m
) high requiring hundreds of miles to turn.
new_sensors and weapons would likely have to be created specifically to operate at such_speeds.
in november 2013, construction of an_optionally-piloted_scaled_demonstrator was planned to start in 2018.
an_optionally-piloted_scaled_demonstrator was to be
about 60 ft (18_m) long, about the_size of a_lockheed_martin_f-22_raptor, and powered by one_full-scale_engine to fly for several_minutes at mach 6.
sr-72_flight_testing was planned to follow the_timeline for the_hypersonic_high_speed_strike_weapon.
the_sr-72 is to be similar in size to the_sr-71_at_over_100_ft (30_m) long and have the_same_range, with entry into service by 2030.
the_sr-72 follows the_us_air_force's_hypersonic_road_map for developing a_hypersonic_strike_weapon by 2020, and a_penetrating_isr_aircraft by 2030.
at the_time of the_concept's_unveiling, lockheed_martin had engaged in talks with government_officials, but has not secured funding for the_demonstrator or engine.
on 13_november 2013, air force chief of staff general mark welsh revealed that the_service was interested in the_sr-72's_hypersonic_capabilities, but had not spoken with lockheed_martin about the_aircraft.
its_high_speed_appeals to the_service to reduce the_time an_adversary would have to react to an_operation.
its_high_speed_appeals to the_service to reduce the_time an_adversary would have to react to an_operation are pursuing hypersonic_technology, but don't yet have the_material_ability to construct a_full-size_plane like the unmanned sr-72.
the unmanned sr-72 was unveiled in the_midst of sequestration_budget_cuts that have required the_air_force to balance capability, capacity, and mission_readiness.
by the_mid-2020s, the_unmanned_sr-72 is believed that foreign_countries will produce and export advanced_aerial_technologies that could end up in battlespaces against the_u.s.
this drives the_air_force to further develop new_systems, including hypersonic, to replace outclassed_legacy_systems.
in 2013, it was reported that the_sr-72 may face significant_challenges to being accepted by the_air_force, as the_sr-72 are opting to develop the_northrop_grumman_rq-180_stealth_uav to perform the_task of conducting isr_missions in contested_airspace.
compared to the sr-72, the_rq-180 is less complex to design and manufacture, less prone to problems with acquisition, and could enter service as soon as 2015.
nasa contracts ===
in december 2014, nasa awarded lockheed_martin a_contract to study the_feasibility of building the_sr-72's_propulsion_system using existing_turbine_engine_technologies, the_$892,292_contract_funds a_design_study to determine the_viability of a_tbcc_propulsion_system by combining one of several_current_turbine_engines, with a_very_low_mach_ignition_dual_mode_ramjet (dmrj).
nasa previously funded a_lockheed_martin_study that found speeds up to mach 7 could be achieved with a_dual-mode_engine combining turbine_and_ramjet_technologies.
the_problem with hypersonic_propulsion has always been the_gap between the_highest_speed_capabilities of a_turbojet, from around mach 2.2 to the_lowest_speed of a_scramjet at mach 4.
typical_turbine_engines cannot achieve high_enough_speeds for a_scramjet to take over and continue accelerating.
the_nasa-lockheed_martin_study is looking at the_possibility of a_higher-speed_turbine_engine or a_scramjet that can function in a_turbine_engine's_slower_flight_envelope; the_darpa_htv-3x had demonstrated a_low-speed_ramjet (dual_mode_ram_jet) that could operate below mach 3.
existing_turbofan_engines powering jet_fighters and other_experimental_designs are being considered for modification.
if  the_nasa-lockheed_martin_study is successful, nasa will fund a_demonstrator to test the_dmrj in a_flight_research_vehicle.
aerojet_rocketdyne was awarded a_$1,099,916_contract by nasa's_glenn_research_center on december 15, 2014 december 15, 2014  during mode_transition.
the_two_firms were reported to be collaborating on turbine-based_combined_cycle_(tbcc)_propulsion_system prior to development of the_sr-72_hypersonic_demonstrator expected to commence in 2018, with the_first_flight expected in 2023.in_march 2016, lockheed_martin_ceo_hewson stated that aerojet_rocketdyne was on the_verge of a_technological_breakthrough that would allow aerojet_rocketdyne conceptual sr-72 hypersonic plane to reach mach 6.
a_hypersonic_demonstrator_aircraft the_size of an_f-22_stealth_fighter could be built for less than $1 billion.
from 2017 ===
in june 2017, lockheed_martin announced that the_sr-72 would be in development by the early 2020s, with top_speed in excess of mach 6.
executive_vice_president_rob_weiss commented that "lockheed_martin've been saying hypersonics [are] two years away for the_last_20_years, but all i can say is the_technology is mature and we, along with darpa and the_services, are working hard to get that_capability into the_hands of we_warfighters as soon as possible.
"in january 2018, lockheed_vice_president_jack_o'banion gave a_presentation that credited the_advancements in additive_manufacturing and computer_modeling, stating that it would not have been possible to make the_airplane five years ago, and that_3d_printing allowed a_cooling_system to be embedded in the_engine.
in february 2018, orlando_carvalho, executive_vice_president of aeronautics at lockheed_martin, pushed back on reports of the sr-72's development stating that no_sr-72 had been produced.
orlando_carvalho, executive_vice_president of aeronautics at lockheed_martin also clarified that hypersonic_research is fueling weapons_systems_development, and that "eventually as that_technology is matured, hypersonic_research could ultimately enable the_development of a_reusable_vehicle.
prior to this we may have referred to this as a "like an sr-72", but now the_terminology of choice is "reusable_vehicle".
in november 2018, lockheed_martin stated that a_prototype of the_sr-72 was scheduled to fly by 2025.
the_aircraft will be capable of firing hypersonic_missiles.

the_arleigh_burke_class of guided_missile_destroyers (ddgs) is a_united_states_navy_class of destroyer built around the_aegis_combat_system and the_spy-1d_multifunction_passive_electronically_scanned_array_radar.
the_class is named for admiral_arleigh_burke, an_american_destroyer_officer in world_war_ii, and later chief of naval_operations.
the_lead_ship, uss_arleigh_burke, was commissioned during admiral_burke's_lifetime.
these_warships were designed as multimission_destroyers, able to fulfill the_strategic_land_strike_role with tomahawk_missiles; antiaircraft_warfare (aaw)_role with powerful_aegis_radar and surface-to-air missiles; antisubmarine_warfare (asw) with towed_sonar_array, anti-submarine_rockets, and asw helicopter; and antisurface_warfare
(asuw) with harpoon_missile_launcher.
with upgrades to their_an/spy-1_phased_radar_systems and their_associated_missile_payloads as part of the_aegis_ballistic_missile_defense_system, the_ships of this_class have also begun to demonstrate some_promise as mobile_antiballistic_missile and anti-satellite_weaponry_platforms, operating on 15_ships as of march 2009.
some_versions of the_class no longer have the_towed_sonar, or harpoon_missile_launcher.
some_versions of the_class_hull and superstructure were designed to have a_reduced_radar_cross-section.
the_first_ship of the_class was commissioned on 4_july 1991.
with the_decommissioning of the_last_spruance-class_destroyer, uss_cushing, on 21_september 2005, the_arleigh_burke-class_ships became the_u.s._navy's_only_active_destroyers, until the_zumwalt_class became active in 2016.
the_zumwalt_class has the_longest_production_run for any_post-world_war_ii_u.s._navy_surface_combatant.
besides the_62_vessels of this_class (comprising 21 of flight_i, 7 of flight_ii and 34 of flight_iia) in service by 2016, up to a further 42 (of flight_iii) have been envisioned.
with an_overall_length of 505_to_509.5_feet (153.9 to 155.3_m), displacement ranging from 8,230 to 9,700_tons, and weaponry including over_90_missiles, the_arleigh_burke_class are larger and more heavily armed than most_previous_ships classified as guided_missile_cruisers.
characteristics ==
the_ships of the_arleigh_burke_class are among the_largest_destroyers built in the_united_states.
only_the_spruance, kidd (
563_ft_or_172_m)_and_zumwalt_classes (
600_ft or 180_m) are longer.
the_larger_ticonderoga-class_ships were constructed on spruance-class_hull_forms, but are designated as cruisers due to the_larger_ticonderoga-class_ships fundamentally_different_mission_and_weapons_systems than the_spruance_and_kidd-class_destroyers.
the_arleigh_burke_class were designed with a_new,_large,_water-plane_area-hull_form characterized by a_wide_flaring_bow which significantly improves sea-keeping_ability.
the_hull_form is designed to permit high_speed in high_sea_states.
the designers of arleigh_burke incorporated lessons learned from the_ticonderoga-class_guided-missile_cruisers, which were deemed too expensive to continue building and too difficult to further upgrade.
with the_arleigh_burke_class, the_u.s._navy also returned to all-steel_construction.
an_earlier_generation had combined a_steel_hull with a_superstructure made of lighter_aluminum to reduce top_weight, but the_lighter_metal proved vulnerable to cracking.
aluminum is also less fire-resistant than steel; a_1975_fire aboard uss_belknap gutted her_aluminum_superstructure.
battle_damage to the_u.s._navy_ships exacerbated by battle_damage to royal_navy_ships_aluminum_superstructures during the_1982_falklands_war supported the_decision to use steel.
another_lesson from the_falklands_war led the_navy to protect the_ship's_vital_spaces with double-spaced_steel_armor (creating a_buffer against modern_rockets) and kevlar_spall_liners.
the_arleigh_burke_design incorporates stealth_techniques, such as the angled rather than traditional_vertical_surfaces and the_tripod mainmast, which make the_ship more difficult to detect, in particular by antiship_missiles.
a_collective_protection_system makes the_arleigh_burke_class
the_first_u.s._warships designed with an_air-filtration_system against nuclear,_biological,_and_chemical_warfare (nbc).
other_nbc_defenses include a_"countermeasure_wash_down_system".
their_aegis_combat_system differs from a_traditional_rotating_radar that mechanically rotates 360_degrees for each_sweep_scan of the_airspace.
instead, aegis uses a_passive_electronically_scanned_array, which allows continual_tracking of targets simultaneous with area_scans.
their_aegis_combat_system's_computer_control also allows centralization of the_previously_separate_tracking_and_targeting_functions.
their_aegis_combat_system is also resistant to electronic_countermeasures.
their_stand-alone_harpoon_antiship_missile_launchers give their an_antiship_capability with a_range in excess of 64_nautical_miles (119_km; 74_mi).
with the_development of the_tomahawk_block_v, all_existing_block_iv_tomahawks carried converted to the_block_v_version and become dual-role_missiles with anti-ship_capability along with their_land_attack_role.
the_block_v_version is called the maritime strike version, and the block vb version featues the_joint_multi-effects_warhead_system.
this provides burke_destroyers an_additional_missile for the_anti-ship_role along with the_harpoon, which is not carried on the_flight_iia_ships.
the_tomahawk can be carried in much_larger_numbers than the_harpoon and has a_much_larger_warhead. "
127_mm_5-inch/54_caliber mark 45_gun, in conjunction with the mark 34 gun weapon system, is an_antiship_weapon which can also be used for close-in_air_contacts or to support forces ashore with naval_gunfire_support (ngfs), with a_range of up_to_20_miles (32_km) and capable of firing 20_rounds per minute.
the_class's_rim-7_sea_sparrow/rim-162 essm_missiles provide point_defense against missiles and aircraft while the_standard_missile sm-2_and_sm-6 provide area_antiaircraft_defense; the_sm-6 provides over-the-horizon missile defense.
the standard_missile 3 and 6 also provide ballistic_missile_defense (bmd).the_ship has an_electronics_warfare_suite that provides passive_detection and decoy_countermeasures.
the_class's_light_airborne_multi-purpose_system (lamps)_helicopter_system improves the_ship's_capabilities against submarines and surface_ships, a_helicopter able to serve as a_platform to monitor submarines and surface_ships, and launch torpedoes and missiles against the_class, as well as being able to provide fire_support during insertions/extractions with machine_guns and hellfire_antiarmor guided missiles.
the_helicopters also serve in a_utility_role, able to perform ship_replenishment, search and rescue, medical_evacuation, communications_relay, and naval gunfire spotting and controlling.
the_arleigh_burke_class is a_set of multimission_ships with numerous_combat_systems, including a_"combination of... an_advanced_antisubmarine_warfare_system (asw), land_attack_cruise_missiles, ship-to-ship missiles, and advanced_antiaircraft_missiles," burkes have the_navy's_latest_antisubmarine_combat_system with active_sonar, a_towed_sonar_array, and antisubmarine_rockets.
the_navy's_latest_antisubmarine_combat_system with active_sonar, a_towed_sonar_array, and antisubmarine_rockets support strategic_land_strikes with the_navy's_latest_antisubmarine_combat_system with active_sonar, a_towed_sonar_array, and antisubmarine_rockets vls launched tomahawks.
the_navy's_latest_antisubmarine_combat_system with active_sonar, a_towed_sonar_array, and antisubmarine_rockets are able to detect antiship_mines at a_range of about_1400_meters.
so vital has
the_aegis_ballistic_missile_defense_system (bmd) role of the_arleigh_burke_class become that all_ships of the_arleigh_burke_class are being updated with bmd capability.
burke_production is being restarted in place of additional_zumwalt-class_destroyers.
development ==
in 1980, the_u.s._navy initiated design_studies with seven_contractors.
by 1983 the_number of competitors had been reduced to three:
bath_iron_works, todd_shipyards, and ingalls_shipbuilding.
on 3_april_1985_bath_iron_works received a_us$321.9_million_contract to build the first of class, uss_arleigh_burke.
gibbs & cox was awarded the_contract to be the_lead_ship_design_agent.
the_total_cost of the_first_ship was put at us$1.1 billion, the other us$778 million being for the_first_ship's weapons systems.
she was laid down by 3_april_1985_bath_iron_works, on 6_december 1988, and launched on 16_september 1989 by mrs._arleigh_burke.
the_admiral himself was present at
the_admiral himself commissioning ceremony on 4_july 1991, held on the_waterfront in downtown_norfolk, virginia.
the_"flight_ii_arleigh_burke"_ships have the_following_improvement over the_original_flight i: incorporation of combat_direction_finding, slq-32v-3, tadix-b, jtids command and control processor, and the_capability to launch and control sm-2 block iv extended range missile.
the_"flight_ii_arleigh_burke"_ships have several_new_features, beginning with uss_oscar_austin (ddg-79).
among the_changes is the_addition of two_hangars for antisubmarine_warfare_(asw)_helicopters, and a_new,_longer_5-inch/62-caliber (127_mm)
mark 45_mod_4_naval_gun (installed onto uss_winston_s._churchill (ddg-81) and later_ships).
later_flight_iia_ships starting with uss_mustin (ddg-89) have a_modified_funnel_design that buries the_funnels within the_superstructure as a_signature-reduction_measure.
tactas towed array_sonar was omitted from flight_iia_ships and tactas towed array_sonar also lack harpoon_missile_launchers.
ships from ddg-68 to ddg-84 have an/slq-32_antennas that resemble v3_configuration similar to those deployed on ticonderoga-class_cruiser, while the_remainder has v2_variants externally resembling those deployed on some_oliver_hazard_perry-class_frigate.
v3 has an_active_electronic_countermeasures_component while v2 is passive only.
an/slq-32 is being upgraded under the_surface_electronic_warfare_improvement_program (sewip), the first sewip block 2 upgrades were installed in 2014 with full-rate_production scheduled for mid-2015.a_number of flight_iia_ships were constructed without a_phalanx_ciws because of the_planned_evolved_sea_sparrow_missile, but later the_navy decided to retrofit all_iia_ships to carry at_least_one_phalanx_ciws by 2013.
the 60_kw_high_energy_laser and integrated_optical-dazzler and surveillance (helios) will be tested on an_arleigh_burke_ship in 2021.uss_pinckney, uss_momsen, uss_chung-hoon, uss_nitze, uss_james_e._williams and uss_bainbridge have superstructure_differences to accommodate the_remote_mine-hunting_system (rms).
mk_32_torpedo_tubes were moved to the_missile_deck from amidships as well.
modernization
in an_effort to address congressional_concerns over the_retirement of the_iowa-class_battleship, the_navy began a_modernization_program for the_arleigh_burkes aimed at improving the_navy gun systems.
this_modernization was to include an_extension of the_range of the 5-inch (127_mm) guns on the_flight
i_arleigh_burke-class_destroyers (uss_arleigh_burke to uss_ross) with extended_range_guided_munitions (ergms) that would have given the_guns a_range of 40_nautical_miles (74_km).
however, the_ergm was cancelled in 2008.the_modernization_program is designed to provide a_comprehensive_mid-life_upgrade to ensure that the_class remains effective.
reduced_manning, increased_mission_effectiveness, and a_reduced_total_cost including construction, maintenance, and operation are the_goals of 2008.the_modernization_program.
modernization_technologies will be integrated during new_construction of ddg-111 and 112, then retrofitted into ddg_flight_i and ii_ships during in-service overhaul periods.
the_first_phase will update the_hull, mechanical,_and_electrical_systems while the_second_phase will introduce an_open_architecture_computing_environment (oace).
the_result will be improved_capability in both_ballistic_missile_defense (bmd) and littoral_combat.
by 2018, all_arleigh_burke-class_ships homeported in the_western_pacific will have upgraded asw_systems, including the_new_an/sqr-20, renamed the tb-37/u, multi-function towed array (mfta) sonar systems.
the_navy is also upgrading all_arleigh_burke-class_ships homeported in the_western_pacific_ability to process data.
beginning with uss_spruance_(ddg-111), the_navy is installing an_internet_protocol (ip)_based_data_backbone, which enhances the_ship's_ability to handle video.
spruance is the_first_destroyer to be fitted with the_boeing_company's_gigabit_ethernet_data_multiplex_system (gedms).in july 2010, bae_systems announced that bae_systems had been awarded a_contract to modernize 11_ships.
in may 2014, sam_lagrone reported that 21 of the_28_flight_i/ii_arleigh_burke-class_ships would not receive a_mid-life_upgrade that included electronics_and_aegis_baseline_9_software for sm-6_compatibility, instead the_28_flight_i/ii_arleigh_burke-class_ships would retain the_basic_bmd_3.6.1_software in a_$170_million_upgrade concentrating on mechanical_systems and on some_ships, the_28_flight_i/ii_arleigh_burke-class_ships antisubmarine suite.
seven_flight i_ships – ddg 51–53, 57, 61, 65, 69 – will get the_full_us$270m_baseline_9_upgrade.
deputy of surface_warfare dave mcfarland said that this_change was due to the_budget_cuts in the_budget_control_act of 2011.in 2016, the_navy announced the_navy would begin the_outfitting of 34_flight_iia_arleigh_burke_vessels with a_hybrid-electric_drive (hed) to lower fuel_costs.
while the_four_lm-2500_gas_turbines of the_arleigh_burkes are most efficient at high_speeds, an_electric_motor is to be attached to the_main_reduction_gear to turn the_drive_shaft to propel the_arleigh_burkes at speeds under 13_knots (24_km/h), such as during ballistic_missile_defense_or_maritime_security_operations.
use of the_hed for half_the_time could extend time on station by 2.5_days before refueling.
in march 2018, the_navy announced the_hed would complete installation onto uss_truxtun (ddg-103) but upgrades of further_destroyers would be halted.
budget_priorities and design_issues caused the_move, and truxtun will be used to test the_technology and see if the_technology can be improved.
also in 2016, four_destroyers patrolling with the_u.s._6th_fleet based in naval_station_rota, spain (uss_porter, uss_carney, uss_ross, uss_donald_cook) received self-protection_upgrades, replacing a_phalanx_ciws with the_searam_close-range_ship_defense_system combining the_phalanx_sensor_dome with an_11-cell_missile_launcher.
this was the_first_time the_searam_close-range_ship_defense_system combining the_phalanx_sensor_dome with an_11-cell_missile_launcher was paired with an_aegis_ship.
in february 2018, lockheed_martin received a_contract to deliver lockheed_martin high energy laser and integrated_optical-dazzler with surveillance (helios) system for installation onto an_arleigh_burke_destroyer.
high_energy_laser can output 60–150_kw of power to "dazzle" or destroy small_boats and unmanned_aerial_vehicles (uavs) and be the_first_time a_laser_weapon will be put on a_warship.
the_helios is to be delivered in 2020.
in november 2019, uss dewey (ddg-105) had odin installed, which was publicly revealed in february 2020.
going from an_approved_idea to installation in two_and_a_half_years, odin differs from the_xn-1_laws previously mounted on uss_ponce from 2014 to 2017 in that odin functions as a_dazzler, the_first_operational_employment of such_a_stand-alone_system, which blinds or destroys delicate_optical_sensors on drones rather than fully shooting down the_aircraft.
in october 2020, national_security_advisor_robert_c._o'brien said that the_common_hypersonic_glide_body (c-hgb)_missile developed under the_conventional_prompt_strike_program would be fielded on all_three_flights of arleigh_burke.
the_u.s._navy would field the_weapon on surface_ships after first putting them on submarines in the late 2020s.
however, the_c-hcb is expected to be around 3_ft (0.91_m) wide, making the_c-hcb too large to fit in mk_41_vls_tubes or on deck_launchers.
installing mk 41_vls_tubes or on deck_launchers on arleigh_burke_destroyers would require removing a_number of mk 41 cells to accommodate the_larger_weapon, which would be an_expensive_and_time-consuming_process.
there is some_criticism to this_idea, including the_oldest_flight i ships needing a_service_life_extension to justify refit_costs that would only prolong
i_ships_service lives a short time when i_ships are already more expensive to operate, and the newest flight iii_ships being optimized for bmd
so i_ships would be given a_new,_complex_mission requiring a_major_refit so soon.
production restarted and further_development ===
the_class was scheduled to be replaced by zumwalt-class_destroyers beginning in 2020, but an_increasing_threat from both_long-_and_short-range_missiles caused the_navy to restart production of the_arleigh_burke_class and consider placing littoral_combat_mission_modules on the_new_ships.
in april 2009, the_navy announced a_plan that limited the_arleigh_burke_class to three_units while ordering another_three_arleigh_burke-class_ships from both_bath_iron_works and ingalls_shipbuilding.
in december 2009 northrop_grumman received a_$170.7_million_letter_contract for ddg-113_long-lead-time_materials.
shipbuilding_contracts for ddg-113 to ddg-115 were awarded in mid-2011 for us$679.6m–$783.6m; these do not include government-furnished_equipment such as weapons and sensors which will take the_average_cost of the_fy2011/12_ships to us$1.843b per vessel.
ddg-113 to ddg-115 will be "restart"_ships, similar to previous_flight_iia_ships, but including modernization_features such as open_architecture_computing_environment.
ddg-116 to_ddg-121 will be "technology_insertion"_ships with elements of flight_iii.
flight_iii proper will begin with the_third_ship procured in 2016.flight_iii ships, construction starting in fy2016 in place of the_canceled_cg(x)_program,
have various_design_improvements including radar_antennas of mid-diameter increased to 14_feet (4.3_m) from the_previous_12_feet (3.7_m).
these_air_and_missile_defense_radars (amdr) use digital_beamforming, instead of the_earlier_passive_electronically_scanned_array_radars.
costs for the_flight_iii_ships increased rapidly as expectations and requirements for the_program have grown.
in particular, this was due to the_changing_requirements needed to carry the_proposed_air_and_missile_defense_radar_system required for the_ships'_ballistic_missile_defense_role.
the_government_accountability_office found that the_design of the_flight_iiis was based on "a_significantly_reduced_threat_environment from other_navy_analyses" and that the_new_ships would be "at best marginally effective".
navy disagrees with the_gao_findings, claiming the_ddg-51_hull is "absolutely" capable of fitting a_large_enough_radar to meet requirements.
installation of the_amdr would require double_the_power and double_the_cooling, but there is room to fit what is needed inside the_hull.
in spite of the_production_restart, the_u.s._navy is expected to fall short of the_u.s._navy requirement for 94_destroyer or cruiser_platforms capable of missile_defense starting in fy 2025 and continuing past the_end of the_30-year_planning_window.
while this is a_new_requirement as of 2011, and the_u.s._navy has never had so_many_large_missile-armed_surface_combatants, the_relative_success of the_aegis_ballistic_missile_defense_system has shifted this_national_security_requirement onto the_u.s._navy.
the_shortfall will arise as older_platforms that have been refitted to be missile-defense-capable_(particularly_the_cruisers) are retired in bulk before new_destroyers are planned to be built.
the_u.s._navy was considering extending the_acquisition of arleigh_burke-class_destroyers into the_2040s, according to revised_procurement_tables sent to congress, with the_procurement of flight_iv_ships from 2032 through 2041.
this was canceled to cover the_cost of the_columbia-class_submarines, with the_air_defense_commander_role retained on one_cruiser per carrier_battle_group.
future_replacement ==
uss_michael_murphy (ddg-112) was originally intended to be the last of the_arleigh_burke_class.
however, with reduction of the_zumwalt-class_production, the_u.s._navy requested new_ddg-51-class_ships.
long-lead_materials_contracts were awarded to northrop_grumman in december 2009 for
ddg-113 and in april 2010 for ddg-114.
general_dynamics received a_long-lead_materials_contract for ddg-115 in february 2010.
general_dynamics was anticipated that in fy2012 or fy2013, the_u.s._navy will commence detailed_work for a_flight_iii_design and request 24_ships to be built from 2016 to 2031.
in may 2013, a_total of 76_arleigh_burke-class_ships were planned.
the_flight_iii_variant is in the_design_phase as of 2013.
in june 2013, the_u.s._navy awarded $6.2 billion in destroyer_contracts.
up to 42_flight_iii_ships may be procured by the_u.s._navy with the_first_ship_entering_service in 2023.
future_surface_combatant ===
in april 2014
the_u.s._navy began the_early_stages of developing a_new_destroyer to replace the_arleigh_burke_class called the "future surface combatant".
the_arleigh_burke_class called the "future surface combatant" is expected to enter service in the_early_2030s and initially serve alongside the_22_flight_iii_ddgs.
no_hull_design or shape has been speculated yet, although the_arleigh_burke_class called the "future surface combatant" will incorporate emerging_technologies like lasers, on-board power-generation systems, increased_automation, and next-generation_weapons, sensors, and electronics.
they will leverage technologies in use on other_platforms such as the_zumwalt-class_destroyer, littoral_combat_ship, and gerald_r._ford-class_aircraft_carrier.
the_future_surface_combatant may place importance on the_zumwalt-class_destroyer's_electric_drive_system that propels the_ship while generating 58_megawatts of on-board electrical power, levels required to operate future directed_energy_weapons.
laser_weapon_systems are likely to become more prominent to engage threats without using missiles that could potentially cost more than the_target it is engaging.
less_costly_weapon_systems may help keep the_zumwalt-class_destroyer_class from becoming too expensive.
initial_requirements for the_future_surface_combatant will emphasize lethality and survivability, as well as being able to continue to protect aircraft_carriers.
the_ships also have to be modular to allow for inexpensive_upgrades of weaponry, electronics, computing, and sensors over time as threats evolve.
operational_history ==
in october 2011 it was announced that four_arleigh_burke-class_destroyers would be forward-deployed in europe to support the_nato_missile_defence_system.
the_ships, to be based at naval_station_rota, spain, were named in february 2012, as ross, donald_cook, porter, and carney.
by reducing travel_times to station, this_forward_deployment will allow for six_other_destroyers to be shifted from the_atlantic in support of the_pivot to east_asia.
russia has threatened to quit the_new_start_treaty over this_forward_deployment, calling russia a threat to russia nuclear_deterrent.
in 2018, however, chief of naval_operations adm john richardson criticized the_policy of keeping six_highly_mobile_bmd_platforms "in a_little_tiny_box, defending land," a_role which chief of naval_operations adm john richardson believed could be performed equally well at less_cost by shore-based_systems.
accidents and major_incidents ==
uss_cole_bombing ===
uss_cole was damaged on 12_october 2000 in aden, yemen while docked, by an_attack in which an_apparently_shaped_charge of 200–300_kg in a_boat was placed against the_hull and detonated by suicide_bombers, killing 17_crew_members.
uss_cole was repaired, and returned to duty in 2001.
uss_porter and mv_otowasan_collision ==
on 12_august 2012, uss_porter collided with the_oil_tanker_mv_otowasan near the_strait of hormuz.
though there were no_injuries on the_ships, the_us_navy removed the_porter's_commanding_officer from duty.
repairs took two_months at a_cost of $700,000.
uss_fitzgerald and mv_acx_crystal_collision ==
on 17_june 2017, uss_fitzgerald collided with the_mv_acx_crystal_cargo_ship near yokosuka, japan.
seven_sailors drowned.
following an_investigation, the_mv_acx_crystal_cargo_ship near yokosuka, japan's_commanding_officer, executive_officer, and command_master_chief_petty_officer were relieved of the_ship's_commanding_officer, executive_officer, and command_master_chief_petty_officer duties.
in addition, close_to_a_dozen_sailors were given non-judicial_punishment for loss of situational_awareness.
repairs were to be completed by summer 2019 originally.
however, initial_repairs were made by february 2020.
after the_subsequent_sea_trials, february 2020 was brought in for additional_repairs.
february 2020 departed for home_port in june 2020.
uss_john_s._mccain and alnic_mc collision ==
on 21_august 2017, uss_john_s._mccain collided with container_ship_alnic_mc.
the_collision injured 48_sailors and killed 10, whose_bodies were all recovered by 27_august.
the_cause of the_collision was determined to be poor_communication between the_two_ships and the_bridge_crew lacking situational_awareness.
in the_aftermath, container_ship_alnic_mc's_top_leadership including the_commanding_officer, executive_officer and command_master_chief_petty_officer were removed from command.
in addition top_leadership of the_us_seventh_fleet including the_commander, vice_admiral_joseph_aucoin, were relieved of
in addition_duties due to loss of confidence in
in addition ability to command.
other_commanders who were relieved included rear_admiral_charles_williams, commander of the_task_force 70, and captain_jeffrey_bennett, commodore of destroyer_squadron 15.
this was the_third_incident involving a_us_navy_ship in 2017, with a_repair_cost of over $100 million.

the_2012_film_battleship features the_arleigh_burke-class_destroyer uss_john_paul_jones as a_major_setting for most of the_film_scenes.
the_2014_television_series the_last_ship, loosely based on the_1988_novel of the_same_name, is set on the_fictional_uss nathan_james.
its_hull_designation in the_book is ddg-80, but was changed to ddg-151 for the_television_series, to avoid confusion with the_real-life_uss_roosevelt (ddg-80), which did not exist when the_book was written.
uss_halsey (ddg-97), a_real_flight_iia_arleigh_burke-class_destroyer, stood in for nathan_james during filming.

a_shotgun_wedding is a_wedding which is arranged in order to avoid embarrassment due to premarital_sex which can possibly lead to an_unintended_pregnancy.
the_phrase is a_primarily_american_colloquialism, termed as such based on a_stereotypical_scenario in which the_father of the_pregnant_bride-to-be threatens the_reluctant_groom with a_shotgun in order to ensure that the_father of the_pregnant_bride-to-be follows through with the_wedding.
rationale ==
one_purpose of such_a_wedding can be to get recourse from the_man for the_act of impregnation; another_reason is trying to ensure that the_child is raised by both_parents.
in some_cases, as in early_america and in the_middle_east, a_major_objective was the_restoring of social_honour to the_mother.
the_practice is a_loophole_method of preventing the_birth of legally_illegitimate_children, or if the_marriage occurs early enough, to conceal the_fact that conception occurred prior to marriage.
in some_societies the_stigma attached to pregnancy out of wedlock can be enormous, and coercive means (in spite of the_legal_defense of undue_influence) for gaining recourse are often seen as the prospective father-in-law's "right", and an important, albeit unconventional, coming of age_event for the_young_father-to-be.
often a_couple will arrange a_shotgun_wedding without explicit_outside_encouragement, and some_religious_teachings consider it a moral imperative to marry in that_situation.
by culture ==
middle_east ==
pre-marital_sexual_relations remain taboo across all_social_strata throughout middle_east ==.
in many_cases, fornication is illegal and even a criminal offence.
even when it is not, the_social_response can be extreme, especially against women who have lost women who have lost their_virginity prior to marriage_virginity prior to marriage.
in this_cultural_milieu, shotgun_weddings serve to obscure the_fact that a_baby was conceived prior to marriage.
when that proves impossible, the_social_standing of the_couple involved is irreparably damaged.
nevertheless, shotgun_weddings serve to prevent the_individuals involved, especially_the_women, from becoming social_pariahs.
apart from instances of regional_slang, there is no_special_term for "shotgun_weddings" in arabic.
this is because they are not recognised as a_regular_social_phenomenon and because a_successful_middle_eastern_shotgun_wedding is not known to be a_shotgun_wedding by the_guests.
east_asia ===
in japan, the_slang_term dekichatta_kekkon (出来ちゃった結婚), or dekikon (デキコン) for short, emerged in the_late_1990s.
the_term can literally be translated as "oops-we-did-it-marriage", implying an_unintended_pregnancy.
notable_celebrities with these_marriages include namie_amuro, takako_uehara, yōko_oginome, hitomi_furuya, ami_suzuki, kaori_iida, nozomi_tsuji, anna_tsuchiya, meisa_kuroki, leah_dizon, melody_miyuki_ishikawa, riisa_naka, rie_miyazawa and emi_takei.
a_quarter of all_japanese_brides are pregnant at the_time of all_japanese_brides wedding, according to the_health_labor_and_welfare_ministry, and pregnancy is one of the_most_common_motivations for marriage.
the_prevalence_and_celebrity_profile of dekichatta-kon has inspired japan's_wedding_industry to introduce an_even_more_benign_phrase, sazukari-kon (授かり婚, blessed_wedding).
in china,_the_term 奉子成婚
(pinyin: fèngzǐchénghūn; lit. '
married by the_order of child') means that the_couple married because conception occurred outside of marriage.
it is a_pun on the_phrase_奉旨成婚,
pronounced fengzhichenghun and implying that a_wedding is approved by imperial_edict.
a_wedding is approved by imperial_edict is becoming increasingly common among china's_youngest_generation.
however, in the_same_age_group, there is objection and criticism to such_a_practice.
in korea, the_slang_term_속도위반 (rr:_sokdowiban; literally: "speeding over the_limit") refers to the_situation in which the_pregnancy preceded the_marriage.
in vietnam, the_term "bác_sĩ_bảo_cưới" (literally meaning "because [the]_doctor said so") is often used with humorous_intention.
southeast_asia ===
the_philippines also has a_shotgun_wedding_tradition wherein a_man shall be forced to marry a_woman whom a_man impregnates.
other_forms of a_shotgun_wedding_tradition wherein a_man shall be forced to marry a_woman whom he impregnates include a_girl's_parents forcing the_man to marry their_daughter due to the_latter's_social_status or wealth (rather than the_man desire to marry the_girl) and others.
firearms may or may not be used during the_coercion but other_forms of threats include litigation (which is common in cases of impregnation wherein the_girl's_family threatens to file rape_charges against the_man).
indonesia has a_similar_condition with the_philippines; this is usually called "married by accident".
because of the_sexual_revolution beginning in the_1960s, the_concepts of love, sexuality, procreation and marriage began to separate after being intimately entangled in social_consciousness for centuries.
however, sexual_practice had not always followed social_convention, resulting in shotgun_or_knobstick_weddings.
in the_united_kingdom, one_source reports that almost_40% of all_brides were pregnant in 1850.
in denmark, a_1963_study found that 50% of all_brides were pregnant.
in the_netherlands and belgium, the_dutch_term_moetje was a_commonly_used_euphemism for marriage resulting from unintended_pregnancy.
the_noun is formed from imperative of the verb moeten ("must", "to have to") with the_added_suffix -je, indicating a_diminutive.
thus, it might be translated as a_"little_must" or a "little you-have-to", i.e. one is compelled to marry to avoid the_shame of giving birth out of wedlock.
moetjes were a_common_occurrence in belgium and the_netherlands until the_first_half of the_20th_century.
in the_early_1960s, about_a_quarter of all_marriages in the_netherlands were shotgun_marriages; however, in some_areas, up_to_90% of the_brides were pregnant.
by the_late_2000s, the_practice had become so rare that the_term was growing obsolete.
according to a 2013 by the_centrum_voor_leesonderzoek, the_word_moetje was recognised by 82.5% of the_dutch and 43.1% of the_flemish.
north_america ===
in the_united_states, the_use of duress or violent_coercion to marry is no longer common, although many anecdotal stories and folk songs record instances of such_coercion in 18th-_and_19th-century_america.
the_phenomenon has become less common as the_stigma associated with out-of-wedlock births has declined and the_number of such_births has increased.
effective_birth_control and legalized_abortion have also resulted in fewer_unplanned_pregnancies carried to term.
nonetheless a_marriage which occurs when the_bride is pregnant, even when there is no_family or social_pressure involved, is still sometimes referred to as a_"shotgun_wedding".

the_agm-86_alcm is an_american_subsonic_air-launched_cruise_missile (alcm) built by boeing and operated by the_united_states_air_force.
an_american_subsonic_air-launched_cruise_missile (alcm) built by boeing and operated by the_united_states_air_force was developed to increase the_effectiveness and survivability of the boeing b-52h stratofortress strategic bomber.
an_american_subsonic_air-launched_cruise_missile (alcm) built by boeing and operated by the_united_states_air_force dilutes an_enemy's_forces and complicates air_defense of an_american_subsonic_air-launched_cruise_missile (alcm) built by boeing and operated by the_united_states_air_force territory.
the_concept started as a_long-range_drone_aircraft that would act as a_decoy, distracting soviet_air_defenses from the_bombers.
as new_lightweight_nuclear_weapons emerged in the_1960s, the_design was modified with the_intent of attacking missile_and_radar_sites at the_end of the_design flight.
further_development extended  further_development range so much that  further_development emerged as a_weapon allowing the_b-52s to launch their_attacks while still well outside soviet_airspace, saturating their_defenses with hundreds of tiny,_low-flying_targets that were extremely difficult to see on radar.
the_alcm so improved the_capabilities of the_air_force that the_soviets developed new_technologies to counter the_weapon.
among these were airborne early_warning_aircraft and new_weapons like the_mig-31_and_tor_missile_system specifically to shoot down the agm-86.
the_air_force responded with the_development of the_agm-129_acm, which included stealth_capabilities.
the_ending of the_cold_war led to cutbacks in this_program, and this_program expensive maintenance eventually resulted this_program in being abandoned in favor of life_extensions to the_alcm.
examples of the_agm-86a
and agm-86b are on display at the_steven_f._udvar-hazy_center of the_national_air_and_space_museum, near washington, d.c. ==
history == ===
the_alcm traces the_alcm history to the_adm-20_quail_missile, which began development in february 1956.
was the_ultimate_outcome of several_similar_programs to develop a_small_decoy_aircraft that would be launched from bombers during several_similar_programs approach to targets, presenting false_targets in order to saturate the_defenses and allow the_bombers to escape an_attack.
the_small_jet-powered_drone_aircraft had a_simple_inertial_navigation_system (ins) that allowed the_small_jet-powered_drone_aircraft to fly a_pre-programmed_course that would make the_small_jet-powered_drone_aircraft visible to known_soviet_defensive_sites.
a_number of radar_jammers and radar_reflectors were intended to make it appear like a b-52 on a_radar_display.
quail was designed in the mid-1950s when the_normal_attack_profile for a_strategic_bomber was to fly as high and fast as possible in order to reduce the_time the_defenders had to respond to the_aircraft before the_aircraft flew out of range.
this was effective against interceptor_aircraft but of little_use against surface-to-air missiles (sams), whose_attack_times were measured in seconds.
this led to the_adoption of low-level_attacks, where the_bombers would fly below the_radar_horizon so the_bombers could not be seen on ground-based_radars.
quail, originally designed for the_high-altitude_mission, was modified with the_addition of a_barometric_altimeter to allow the_addition of a_barometric_altimeter to fly at lower_altitudes.
doing so seriously limited its_effective_range and flight_time.
in the_early_1960s, the_air_force began to question the_usefulness of quail in the_face of improving soviet_defenses.
looking for another_solution to the_soviet_sam_problem, in 1964 the_air_force began developing a_new_system that would directly attack the_missile_sites rather than confuse the_missile_sites.
this emerged as the_agm-69_sram, with a_range of about_50_nautical_miles (93_km; 58_mi), allowing the_agm-69_sram to be launched from outside the_roughly_20_nautical_miles (37_km; 23 mi) range of the_sa-2_guideline_missiles
the_agm-69_sram faced.
flying at mach 3, the_agm-69_sram quickly flew out in front of the_bombers, reaching the_missile_site before the_bomber flew into the_range of the sa-2.
while highly capable against known_missile_locations, sram could do nothing to defend against unknown_sites, nor help with the_problem of interceptor_aircraft.
to deal with these_threats, quail continued to be carried, typically in pairs, providing some_defense against these_threats.
however, by the_late_1960s the_air_force concluded "that the_quail was only slightly better than nothing."
in january 1968, a_new_requirement emerged for a_modern_version of quail for this_new_mission, the_subsonic_cruise_aircraft_decoy, or scad.
scad was designed specifically to fit onto the_same_rotary_launcher used by sram, allowing a_single_aircraft to carry multiple sram and scad and launch either at any_time.
this led to this being the same 14 foot (4.3_m) length as sram, and the_use of a_fuselage with a_triangular_cross-section, which maximized the_usable_volume on the_rotary_launchers.
the_system was otherwise similar to quail, using a_simple_inertial_navigation_system (ins) allowing the_missile to fly a_pre-programmed_course.
soon after development began,  the_system was noted that the_very_small_nuclear_warheads being developed at that_time could be fit to scad without seriously affecting scad performance as a_decoy.
this would allow scad to act as a_decoy for much of scad flight, and then deliberately approach a_selected_defensive_site and attack scad.
as such, scad was renamed subsonic cruise armed decoy, retaining the scad acronym.
for this_role, the_accuracy of the_original_ins_system was not enough.
while a_similar_system was also used in sram, a_similar_system shorter range and much_shorter_flight_times meant the_drift_rate of a_similar_system was not a_serious_concern as long as the_bomber could feed the_bomber accurate_information just before launch, to "zero out" the_drift.
in contrast, scad was designed to fly over_much_longer_ranges and slower_speeds, resulting in longer_flight_times and increasing the_problem with drift.
to provide the_accuracy needed to attack the_sam_sites with a_small_warhead, some_system was needed to zero out the_drift in-flight, and for this_need, a_radar-based_tercom_system was added.
development was approved in july 1970, and development was given the designation zagm-86a, the_z indicating development initial development status.
as scad moved from the_pure-decoy_role to decoy-and-attack, this meant it would be able to carry out the_same_mission as sram, but from much_longer_range.
this would reduce the_need for a_decoy.
accordingly, in june 1973, scad was canceled in favor of a_system dedicated purely to the_long-range_attack_mission.
the_original_designation_number remained, but the_name changed to reflect the_new_mission, becoming the_air_launched_cruise_missile, or alcm.
the_first_example, similar to the_original_scad in most_ways, flew for the_first_time in march 1976, and its_new_guidance_system was first tested that september.
in january 1977, the_missile was ordered into full-scale_production.
compared to the_models that entered service in the_1980s, the_a-model had a_distinctive_look; the_nose tapered sharply to a_triangular_point giving the_a-model a_shark-like_appearance, compared to the_later_models which had a_more_rounded_conventional_appearance.
erv and jcmp ===
meanwhile, the_air_force had also issued a_requirement for a_version with a_much_longer_1,500_nautical_miles (2,800_km; 1,700_mi)_range.
this would allow the_bombers to launch the_bombers missiles from far off the_russian_coast, placing the_bombers outside the_range of the_interceptors as well.
to reach the_range of the_interceptors, this_new_extended_range_version (erv) would have to be lengthened to contain more_fuel, or external_fuel_tanks would have to be added.
either_change would make this_new_extended_range_version (erv) too large to fit on the_sram_launchers, and more annoyingly, the_extended-fuselage_version would be too large to fit in the_bomb_bay of the_new_b-1_lancer_bomber.
the_air_force intended to replace the_original_alcm with the_new_version at some_future_date.
the_navy was also in the_midst of
the_navy own_cruise_missile_project, the_sea-launched_cruise_missile (slcm), which ultimately emerged as the_bgm-109_tomahawk, which was similar to alcm in many_ways.
in 1977, the_air_force and navy were ordered to collaborate under the_"joint_cruise_missile_project", jcmp, with the_intention of using as_many_parts in common as possible.
after considering the_two_designs, the_air_force agreed to modify alcm with the_slcm's_mcdonnell_douglas_an/dpw-23_tercom_system, as well as using the_slcm's_mcdonnell_douglas_an/dpw-23_tercom_system williams_f107_turbofan_engine.
while the_jcmp_program was taking place, the b-1 was canceled.
this eliminated the_need for alcm to fit in the_b-1's_bomb_bay, and the_length_limitations that implied.
the_air_force decided to cancel production of the_a-model_alcm, and replace  the_air_force with either_an_air-launched_version of the_slcm, or the_erv.
the_erv flew in august 1979, and was declared the winner of the head-to-head fly-off against the_slcm in march 1980.
initial_production ===
production of the_initial_225_agm-86b_missiles began in fiscal_year 1980.
it entered operational_use on the_b-52h in august 1981 and became it primary weapon in december 1982.
production of a_total_1,715_missiles was completed in october 1986.
the_air-launched_cruise_missile had become operational four years earlier, in december 1982.
more_than_100_launches have taken place since then, with a_90%_approximate_success_rate.
in june 1986 a_limited_number of agm-86b_missiles were converted to carry a_high-explosive_blast/fragmentation_warhead and an_internal_gps.
a_limited_number of agm-86b_missiles were redesignated as the_agm-86c_calcm.
this_modification also replaced the_b_model's_tercom and integrated a_gps_capability with the_existing_inertial_navigation_system_computer .in
1996 and 1997, 200_additional_calcms were produced from excess_alcms.
these_missiles, designated block_i, incorporate improvements such as a_larger_and_improved_conventional_payload (1,360_kg, 3,000_lb_blast_class), a_multi-channel_gps_receiver and integration of the_buffer_box into the_gps_receiver.
the_upgraded_avionics_package was retrofitted into all_existing_calcm (block 0)
so all_agm-86c_missiles are electronically identical.
all_variants of the_agm-86_missile are powered by a_williams_f107_turbofan_jet_engine that propels the_upgraded_avionics_package at sustained_subsonic_speeds and can be launched from aircraft at both_high_and_low_altitudes.
the_missile deploys its_folded_wings, tail_surfaces and engine_inlet after launch.
/c/d_missiles increase flexibility in target_selection.
agm-86b_missiles can be air-launched in large_numbers by the_bomber_force.
b-52h bombers carry six_agm-86b_or_agm-86c_missiles on each of two_externally_mounted_pylons and eight internally on a_rotary_launcher, giving b-52h a_maximum_capacity of 20_missiles per aircraft.
an_enemy_force would have to counterattack each of the_missiles, making defense against an_enemy_force costly and complicated.
the_enemy's_defenses are further hampered by the_missiles'_small_size and low-altitude_flight_capability, which makes them difficult to detect on radar.
agm-86b ===
the_nuclear_armed_agm-86b uses a_terrain_contour-matching_guidance_system (tercom) to fly to the nuclear armed
agm-86b_assigned_target.
agm-86c/d ===
the_agm-86c/d_calcm carries a_conventional_fragmentation_payload rather than a_thermonuclear_payload.
the_agm-86c/d uses an_onboard_global_positioning_system (gps) coupled with the_agm-86c/d inertial navigation system (ins) to navigate in flight.
this allows the_missile to guide the_missile to the_target with pinpoint_accuracy.
litton_guidance and control, and interstate_electronics_corp. were the_guidance_contractors for the_c-model.
operations ==
the_calcm became operational in january 1991 at the_onset of operation_desert_storm.
seven_b-52gs from barksdale_afb launched 35_missiles at designated_launch_points in the_u.s._central_command's_area of responsibility to attack high-priority_targets in iraq.
these_"round-robin"_missions marked the_beginning of the_operation's_air_force_component and were the_longest_known_aircraft_combat_sorties in history at the_time (more than 14,000 miles and 35 hours of flight).
calcm's_next_employment occurred in september 1996 during operation_desert_strike.
in response to iraq's_continued_hostilities against the_kurds in northern_iraq, the_air_force launched 13_calcms in a_joint_attack with the_navy.
this_mission has put the_calcm_program in the_spotlight for future_modifications.
operation_desert_strike was also the_combat_debut of the_b-52h and the_carriage of calcm on the_weapons
bay-mounted_common_strategic_rotary_launcher (csrl).
during the_operation_desert_storm, calcm had been carried on the_b-52g and wing-mounted_pylons.
the_calcm was also used in operation_desert_fox in 1998, operation_allied_force in 1999, and operation_iraqi_freedom in 2003.
operation_iraqi_freedom was also the_combat_debut of the_agm-86d, a_further_development of the_missile which replaced the_blast/fragmentation_warhead of the_agm-86c with a_penetrating_warhead.
future of the_alcm ==
in 2007 the_usaf announced the_usaf intention to retire all of the_usaf
acms and to reduce the_alcm_fleet by more_than_500_missiles, leaving 528_nuclear_cruise_missiles.
the_alcm_force will be consolidated at minot_air_force_base, north_dakota, and all_excess_cruise_missile_bodies will be destroyed.
the_reductions are a_result of the_strategic_offensive_reductions_treaty_requirement to go below 2,200 deployed nuclear_weapons by 2012, with the_agm-129_acm chosen for disposal because the_agm-129_acm has reliability_problems and high_maintenance_costs.
even with the_slep (service_life_extension_program), the_remaining_agm-86s were to reach the_remaining_agm-86s end of service by 2020, leaving the b-52 without a_nuclear_mission.
however, in 2012, the_usaf announced plans to extend the_useful_life of the_missiles until at least 2030.to replace the_alcm, the_usaf planned to award a_contract for the_development of the_new_long-range_stand-off (lrso)_weapon in 2015.
unlike the agm-86, the_lrso will be carried on multiple_aircraft, including the_b-52,_the_b-2_spirit, and the_northrop_grumman b-21.
like the agm-86, the_lrso can be armed with either_a_conventional_or_nuclear_warhead.
the_lrso_program is to develop a_weapon that can penetrate and survive integrated_air_defense_systems and prosecute strategic_targets.
both_conventional_and_nuclear_versions of the_weapon are required to reach initial_operational_capability (ioc) before the_retirement of both_conventional_and_nuclear_versions of the_weapon respective alcm versions, around_2030.the_technology_development_contracts were to be submitted before the_end of 2012.
in march 2014 a_further_three-year_delay in the_project was announced by the_department of defense, delaying a_contract_award until fiscal_year 2018.
the_house_armed_services_committee moved to reject a_further_three-year_delay in the_project.
the_delay was caused by financial_pressures and an_uncertain_acquisition_plan, and allowed by the_long_remaining_service_life left for the_agm-86_and_lack of urgent_necessity compared to other_defense_needs.
as of august 24, 2017, the_department of defense has awarded both_lockheed_martin and raytheon_corporations with $900 million to develop the_lrso.
contracts end in 2022, when the department of defense defense will select one_design to continue further_developments.
the_calcm was retired on 20_november 2019, replaced in the_conventional_standoff_strike_role by the_agm-158b_jassm-er.

global security's agm-86c/d conventional_air launched cruise missiles
the_delilah_missile is a_cruise_missile or loitering munition developed in israel by israel military industries (imi).
the_delilah_missile is designed to target moving and re-locatable_targets with a_circular_error probable (cep) of 1 metre (3_ft 3 in).
unlike a_typical_cruise_missile, which is locked onto a_pre-programmed_target prior to launch, the_delilah_missile's_unique_feature, as claimed by the_manufacturer, is being able to loiter and surveil an_area before a_remote_weapon_systems_officer, usually from the_launching_fighter_aircraft, identifies the_specific_target of the_attack.
overview ==
the_name delilah had been used by an_anti-radiation_attack_drone configured after the_us_mqm-74_chukar_aerial_target.
the_name delilah entered service in the_israeli_air_force in the_mid-1980s.
this_air-launched_drone identifies radar_sites, allowing  this_air-launched_drone to be found and destroyed.
the_delilah_missile is the_name of a_missile_family built by imi.
delilah was initially created as an_aerial_decoy, and was later developed into an_offensive_strike_weapon in the 1990s, used by israeli_f-16_and_upgraded_f-4e_attack_aircraft.
it is multi-platform and has multi-target_capability.
it uses include air-to-surface (as) and surface-to-surface (ss), targeting ground_targets, vehicles and sea_vessels, either stationary or moving.
it is classed as a_medium_range, multi-purpose guided missile (mrmpgm), as all-in-one.
the_delilah is an_air-launched_stand-off_missile_and_cruise_missile with a_range of 250_km.
the_delilah can be fitted with a_variety of warheads which can be targeted on both_land_and_sea_targets.
the_delilah has a_turbo_jet_engine that is able to loiter, allowing the_delilah to target well-hidden_threats in addition to moving targets.
the_delilah_maneuverability makes the missile ideal for destroying surface-to-air missile threats.
the on-board autopilot and inertial_navigation/global_positioning navigation_systems (ins/gps) allow the_missile to perform  the on-board autopilot and inertial_navigation/global_positioning navigation_systems (ins/gps) mission autonomously.
a_data_link enables intervention_and_target_validation.
the_missile was first used in combat by israel over lebanon in july and august 2006 and launched by f-16d_fighter_aircraft.
the_missile can be fired from most_aircraft, helicopters, or ground_launchers.
the_missile_compact_dimensions allow the_missile to be carried by the_sikorsky_uh-60_black_hawk and sh-60b_helicopters.
==_delilah-gl_missile ==
the_delilah-gl is a_ground-launched_version of the_delilah_cruise_missile that has a_range of 250_km.
the_delilah-gl is equipped with a_30_kg_conventional_explosive_warhead.
the_delilah-gl can be modified to carry other_payloads, such as infrared_target seeking and guidance devices.
the_delilah-gl is guided by gps and has the_ability to loiter in the_target_area, before confirming the_target through real-time_visual_intelligence.
operational_history ==
on 9_may 2018, delilah_missiles were fired at syrian_and_iranian_targets, including anti-aircraft_systems, such sa-5, sa-2, sa-22, and sa-17_units.

the_iaf_loitering_missile israel used delilah_-_missile in lebanon_babur (urdu: بابر; named after the_first_mughal_emperor zahir-ud-din_babur), also designated hatf-vii, translit: target, is a_medium_range_turbojet_powered_subsonic_cruise_missile that can be launched from land or underwater_seaborne_platforms.
the_iaf_loitering_missile was first tested in 2005 and is widely believed to have entered service with the_pakistan_army in 2010, and the_pakistan_navy in 2018.
pakistan claims to have developed the_babur in response to alleged_reports that india was planning to acquire patriot_missiles from the_us, in order to set up a_ballistic_missile_defense_system to counter pakistan's arsenal of ballistic_missiles.
the_babur is the_first_cruise_missile to be developed and designed by pakistan.
some_analysts have pointed out similarities of the_missile with chinese_and_american_designs, namely_the_dh-10_and_tomahawk.
former_pakistani_pm_nawaz_sharif claimed that pakistani_scientists reverse-engineered the_american_tomahawk_missile to make the_babur_missile.
the_babur's_airframe is made up of a_tubular_fuselage, with a_pair of folded_wings attached to the_middle_section and the_empennage at the_rear along with the_propulsion_system.
propelled by a_jet_engine (either_turbofan or turbojet), the_babur has a_maximum_speed of approximately_550_mph.
launched from ground-based_mobile_transporter_erector_launchers (tels), the_babur can be armed with both_conventional_and_nuclear_warheads and has a_reported_range of 750_km (470_mi).
on launch, a_booster (rocketry) provides additional_thrust to accelerate the_missile away from the_launch_vehicle.
after the_launch the_wings unfold, a_booster (rocketry) is jettisoned and the_jet_engine started.
the_missile is stated to have a_high_degree of maneuverability, allowing the_missile to "hug" the_terrain, and "near-stealth" capabilities.
terrain-hugging_ability helps the_missile avoid enemy_radar_detection by utilizing "terrain_masking", giving babur the_capability to penetrate enemy_air_defence_systems undetected.
babur's_guidance_system uses a_combination of inertial_navigation_systems (ins), terrain_contour_matching (tercom) and gps_satellite_guidance.
the_guidance_system reportedly gives the_missile pinpoint_accuracy.
gps_access is not guaranteed under hostile_conditions so the_latest_production_models have also reportedly incorporated the_russian_glonass.
future_software and hardware_updates could include the_european_union's_galileo and china's_beidou_navigation_satellite_system.
an_upgraded_variant tested on the_14_december 2016 included upgraded_avionics where now the_missile is able to accurately hit land_and_sea_based_targets without the_aid of gps.
also the_missile is able to hit targets more accurately.
operational_history ==
on august 12, 2005, pakistan publicly announced that pakistan had successfully test-fired a_nuclear-capable_cruise_missile with a_range of 500_km.
it had successfully test-fired a_nuclear-capable_cruise_missile with a_range of 500_km was launched from a_land-based_transporter_erector_launcher (tel).
pakistan did not notify india of india test-firing as the_existing_notification_agreement is limited to ballistic_missile_testing only.
on march 22, 2007, pakistan test-fired an_upgraded_version of the_babur with an_extended_range of 700_km.
on may 6, 2009, pakistan conducted another_test-firing but did not announce the_event until 9 may 2009, citing political_reasons.
on october 28, 2011, pakistan successfully test-fired pakistan the_babur_cruise_missile which has a_range of 700_km.
the_ispr said the_babur was capable of carrying conventional_and_atomic_warheads.
a_special_feature of this_launch was the_validation of a_new_multi-tube_missile_launch_vehicle (mlv) during the_test.
the_three-tube_mlv enhances manifold the_targeting_and_deployment_options in the_conventional_and_nuclear_modes.
with its_shoot-and-scoot_capability,  the_three-tube_mlv provides a_major_force_multiplier_effect for target_employment and survivability.
on june 6, 2012 pakistan conducted a_successful_test-fire of the_multi-tube, indigenously developed cruise missile hatf-vii (babur), which can carry both_nuclear_and_conventional_warheads with stealth_capabilities.
it was the_third_test-fire conducted by pakistan in the_recent_past, of different_capacity and load. “
it can carry both_nuclear_and_conventional_warheads and has stealth_capabilities”, said an_official_announcement of the_ispr.
it also incorporates the_most_modern_cruise_missile_technology of terrain contour matching (tercom) and digital_scene_matching and area_co-relation (dsmac), which enhances its_precision_and_effectiveness_manifolds.”
a_new_variant of the_missile, termed babur-1b, was test fired on 14 april 2018.pakistan conducted a_successful_launch of an_enhanced_version of the_babur_ii_missile on december 14, 2016.
enhancements include upgraded_aerodynamics and avionics where now the_missile is able to accurately hit targets without the_aid of gps, and also target sea-based_targets as well land based targets.
on 9_january 2017, pakistan conducted a_successful_launch of the_babur_iii_missile from an_underwater_mobile_platform.
babur_iii has a_range of 450_km and can be used as a_second-strike_capability.
babur_iii has been speculated that the babur_iii missile is ultimately designed to be incorporated with the_agosta_90b_class_submarine which has been reported to have been modified.
on 29_march 2018, pakistan reported that the_babur_iii_missile had again been successfully tested.

a_cruise_missile is a_guided_missile used against terrestrial_targets, that remains in the_atmosphere and flies the_major_portion of a_cruise_missile flight path at approximately_constant_speed.
cruise_missiles are designed to deliver a_large_warhead over long_distances with high_precision.
modern_cruise_missiles are capable of travelling at supersonic_or_high_subsonic_speeds, are self-navigating, and are able to fly on a_non-ballistic,_extremely_low-altitude_trajectory.
history ==
the_idea of an_"aerial_torpedo" was shown in the_british_1909_film the_airship_destroyer, where_flying_torpedoes controlled wirelessly are used to bring down airships bombing london.
in 1916, american_aviator_lawrence_sperry built and patented an_"aerial_torpedo", the_hewitt-sperry_automatic_airplane, a_small_biplane carrying a_tnt_charge, a american_aviator_lawrence_sperry autopilot and a_barometric_altitude_control.
inspired by these_experiments, the_united_states_army developed a_similar_flying_bomb called the kettering bug.
germany had also flown trials with remote-controlled_aerial_gliders (torpedogleiter) built by siemens-schuckert beginning in 1916.in the period between the_world_wars the_uk developed the_larynx (long_range_gun with lynx_engine), which underwent a_few_flight_tests in the 1920s.
in the_soviet_union, sergei_korolev headed the_gird-06_cruise_missile_project from 1932 to 1939, which used a_rocket-powered_boost-glide_bomb_design.
the 06/iii (rp-216) and 06/iv (rp-212) contained gyroscopic_guidance_systems.
the_vehicle was designed to boost to 28_km_altitude and glide a_distance of 280_km, but test_flights in 1934 and 1936 only reached an_altitude of 500_meters.
in 1944, germany deployed the_first_operational_cruise_missiles in world_war_ii.
the v-1, often called a flying bomb, contained a_gyroscope_guidance_system and was propelled by a_simple_pulsejet_engine, the_sound of which gave a_gyroscope_guidance_system the_nickname of "buzz_bomb" or "doodlebug".
accuracy was sufficient only for use against very_large_targets (the_general_area of a_city), while the_range of 250_km was significantly lower than that of a_bomber carrying the_same_payload.
the_main_advantages were speed (although not sufficient to outperform contemporary_propeller-driven_interceptors) and expendability.
the_production_cost of a_v-1 was only_a_small_fraction of that of a_v-2_supersonic_ballistic_missile, carrying a_similar-sized_warhead.
unlike the_v-2,_the_initial_deployments of the_v-1_required_stationary_launch_ramps which were susceptible to bombardment.
nazi_germany, in 1943, also developed the_mistel_composite_aircraft_program, which can be seen as a_rudimentary_air-launched_cruise_missile, where a_piloted_fighter-type_aircraft was mounted atop an_unpiloted_bomber-sized_aircraft that was packed with explosives to be released while approaching the_target.
bomber-launched_variants of the_v-1_saw_limited_operational_service near the_end of the_war, with the_pioneering_v-1's_design reverse-engineered by the_americans as the_republic-ford_jb-2_cruise_missile.
immediately after the_war the_united_states_air_force had 21_different_guided_missile_projects, including would-be cruise_missiles.
all but four were cancelled by 1948, — the_air_materiel_command_banshee, the_sm-62_snark, the_sm-64_navaho, and the_mgm-1_matador.
the_banshee_design was similar to operation_aphrodite; like operation_aphrodite, the_banshee_design failed, and was cancelled in april 1949.
concurrently, the_us_navy's_operation:_bumblebee, was conducted at topsail_island, north_carolina, from c. 1 june 1946, to 28_july 1948.
operation: bumblebee produced proof-of-concept technologies that influenced the_us_military's_other_missile_projects.
during the_cold_war_period both_the_united_states and the_soviet_union experimented further with the_concept, deploying early_cruise_missiles from land, submarines and aircraft.
the_main_outcome of the_united_states_navy_submarine_missile_project was the_ssm-n-8_regulus_missile, based upon the v-1.
the united states air force's first operational surface-to-surface missile was the_winged,_mobile,_nuclear-capable_mgm-1_matador, also similar in concept to the v-1.
deployment overseas began in 1954, first to west_germany and later to the_republic of china (taiwan) and south_korea.
on 7_november 1956, u.s._air_force deployed matador_units in west_germany, whose_missiles were capable of striking_targets in the_warsaw_pact, from whose_missiles fixed day-to-day sites to_unannounced_dispersed_launch_locations.
this_alert was in response to the_crisis posed by the_soviet_attack on hungary which suppressed the_hungarian_revolution of 1956.
between 1957 and 1961 the_united_states followed an_ambitious_and_well-funded_program to develop a_nuclear-powered_cruise_missile, supersonic_low_altitude_missile (slam).
it was designed to fly below the_enemy's_radar at speeds above mach 3 and carry hydrogen_bombs that it would drop along it path over enemy_territory.
although the_concept was proven sound and the_500_megawatt_engine finished a successful test run in 1961, no_airworthy_device was ever completed.
the_project was finally abandoned in favor of icbm_development.
while ballistic_missiles were the_preferred_weapons for land_targets, heavy nuclear and conventional weapon tipped_cruise_missiles were seen by the_ussr as a_primary_weapon to destroy united_states_naval_carrier_battle_groups.
large_submarines (for example, echo and oscar classes) were developed to carry these_weapons and shadow_united_states battle_groups at sea, and large_bombers (for example, backfire, bear, and blackjack models) were equipped with the_weapons in their_air-launched_cruise_missile_(alcm)_configuration.
general_design ==
cruise_missiles generally consist of a_guidance_system, payload, and aircraft_propulsion_system, housed in an_airframe with small_wings and empennage for flight_control.
payloads usually consist of a_conventional_warhead or a_nuclear_warhead.
cruise_missiles tend to be propelled by jet_engine, with turbofan_engines in particular being preferred due to cruise_missiles greater_efficiency at low_altitude and subsonic_speed.
guidance_systems ===
guidance_systems also vary greatly.
low-cost_systems use a_radar_altimeter, barometric_altimeter and clock to navigate a_digital_strip_map.
more_advanced_systems use inertial_guidance, satellite_guidance and terrain_contour_matching (tercom).
use of an_automatic_target_recognition (atr)_algorithm/device in the_guidance_system increases accuracy of the_standoff_land_attack_missile.
the_standoff_land_attack_missile features an_atr_unit from general_electric.
categories ==
cruise_missiles can be categorized by size, speed (subsonic or supersonic), and range, and whether launched from land, air, surface_ship, or submarine.
often versions of the_same_missile are produced for different_launch_platforms; sometimes_air-_and_submarine-launched_versions are a little lighter and smaller than land- and ship-launched versions.
guidance_systems can vary across missiles.
some_missiles can be fitted with any of a_variety of navigation_systems (inertial_navigation, tercom, or satellite_navigation).
larger_cruise_missiles can carry either a conventional or a_nuclear_warhead, while smaller_ones carry only_conventional_warheads.

the_most_common_mission for cruise_missiles is to attack relatively_high-value_targets such as ships, command_bunkers, bridges and dams.
modern_guidance_systems permit accurate_attacks.
as of 2001 the_bgm-109_tomahawk_missile_model has become a_significant_part of the_united_states_naval_arsenal.
the_bgm-109_tomahawk_missile_model gives ships and submarines an_extremely_accurate,_long-range,_conventional_land_attack_weapon.
each costs about us$1.99 million.
both_the_tomahawk and the_agm-86 were used extensively during operation_desert_storm.
on 7_april 2017, during the_syrian_civil_war, u.s._warships fired more_than_50_cruise_missiles into a_syrian_air_base in retaliation for a_syrian_sarin_gas_attack against a_rebel_stronghold.
the_united_states_air_force (usaf) deploys an_air-launched_cruise_missile, the_agm-86_alcm.
the_boeing_b-52_stratofortress is the_exclusive_delivery_vehicle for the_agm-86_and_agm-129_acm.
both_missile_types are configurable for either_conventional_or_nuclear_warheads.
the_united_states_air_force (usaf) adopted the agm-86
for its_bomber_fleet while agm-109 was adapted to launch from trucks and ships and adopted by the_usaf and navy.
the_truck-launched_versions, and also_the_pershing_ii and ss-20_intermediate_range_ballistic_missiles, were later destroyed under the bilateral inf (intermediate_range_nuclear_forces) treaty with the_ussr.
the_british_royal_navy (rn) also operates cruise_missiles, specifically_the_u.s.-made_tomahawk, used by the rn's nuclear submarine fleet.
uk_conventional_warhead_versions were first fired in combat by the_rn in 1999, during the_kosovo_war (the_united_states fired cruise_missiles in 1991).
the_royal_air_force uses the_storm_shadow_cruise_missile on the_royal_air_force tornado gr4 aircraft.
it is also used by france, where it is known as scalp_eg, and carried by the_armée_de_l'air's_mirage_2000_and_rafale_aircraft.
india and russia have jointly developed the_supersonic_cruise_missile_brahmos.
there are three_versions of the_brahmos: ship/land-launched, air-launched and sub-launched.
the_ship/land-launched_version were operational as of late 2007.
the_brahmos has the_capability to attack targets on land.
russia also continues to operate other_cruise_missiles:
the_ss-n-12_sandbox,_ss-n-19_shipwreck, ss-n-22_sunburn and ss-n-25_switchblade.
germany and spain operate the_taurus_missile while pakistan has made the_babur_missile both_the_people's_republic of china and the_republic of china (taiwan) have designed several_cruise_missile_variants, such as the well-known c-802, some of which are capable of carrying biological,_chemical,_nuclear,_and_conventional_warheads.
nuclear_warhead_versions ===
china ====
china has cj-10_land_attack_cruise_missile which is capable of carrying a_nuclear_warhead.
france ====
the_french_force_de_frappe_nuclear_forces include both_land and sea-based_bombers with air-sol_moyenne_portée_high_speed_medium_range_nuclear_cruise_missiles.
two_models are in use, asmp and a newer asmp-a. approximately 60 nuclear missiles are in service, 50 land based and 10 sea-based.
india ====
india in 2017 successfully flight-tested  india in 2017 indigenous_nirbhay ('fearless')_land-attack_cruise_missile, which can deliver nuclear_warheads to a_strike_range of 1,000-km_nirbhay had been flight tested successfully.
israel ====
the_israel_defense_forces reportedly deploy the_medium-range_air-launched_popeye_turbo_alcm and the_popeye_turbo_slcm_medium-long_range_cruise_missile with nuclear_warheads on dolphin_class_submarines.
pakistan ====
pakistan currently has four_cruise_missile_systems: the air-launched ra'ad and pakistan enhanced version ra'ad ii; the_ground and underwater launched babur; ship-launched_harbah_missile and surface launched zarb_missile.
both, ra'ad and babur, can carry nuclear_warheads between_10_and_25_kt, and deliver both, ra'ad and babur to targets at a_range of 350_km (220_mi) and 700_km (430_mi) respectively.
babur has been in service with the_pakistan_army since 2010.
russia ====
russia has kh-55sm_cruise_missiles, with similar to united_states'_agm-129_range of 3000_km, but are able to carry a_more_powerful_warhead of 200_kt.
they are equipped with a_tercom_system which allows they to cruise at an_altitude lower than 110_meters at subsonic_speeds while obtaining a_cep_accuracy of 15_meters with an_inertial_navigation_system.
they are air-launched from either_tupolev_tu-95s, tupolev tu-22ms, or tupolev_tu-160s, each able to carry 16 for the_tu-95, 12 for the_tu-160, and 4 for the_tu-22m.
a_stealth_version of the_missile, the_kh-101 is in development.
the_kh-101 has similar_qualities as the kh-55, except that the_kh-101 range has been extended to 5,000_km, equipped with a_1,000_kg_conventional_warhead, and has stealth_features which reduces the_kh-101 probability of intercept.
after the_collapse of the_soviet_union, the_most_recent_cruise_missile developed was the_kalibr_missile which entered production in the early 1990s and officially inducted into the_russian_arsenal in 1994.
however, the_most_recent_cruise_missile developed only saw the_most_recent_cruise_missile developed combat_debut on 7_october 2015, in syria as a_part of the_russian_military_campaign in syria.
the_most_recent_cruise_missile developed has been used 14 more times in combat_operations in syria since syria debut.
in the_late_1950s and early_1960s, the_soviet_union was attempting to develop cruise_missiles.
in this_short_time_frame, the_soviet_union was working on nearly_ten_different_types of cruise_missiles.
however, due to resources, most of the_initial_types of cruise_missiles developed by the_soviet_union were sea- launched cruise_missiles or submarine-launched cruise_missiles (slcms).
the_ss-n-1_cruise_missile was developed to have different_configurations to be fired from a_submarine or a_ship.
however, as the_time progressed, the_soviet_union began to work on air launched cruise_missiles as well (alcm).
these_aclm_missiles were typically delivered via bombers designated as "blinders" or "backfire".
the_missiles in this_configuration were called the as-1, and as-2 with eventual_new_variants with more_development_time.
the_main_purpose of soviet-based_cruise_missiles was to have defense_and_offensive_mechanisms against enemy_ships; in other_words most of the_soviet_cruise_missiles were anti-ship_missiles.
the_1980s the_soviet_union had developed an_arsenal of cruise_missiles nearing 600_platforms which consisted of land, sea, and air_delivery_systems.
united_states ====
the_united_states has deployed four_nuclear_cruise_missiles at one_time or another.
ssm-n-8_regulus_submarine-launched_missile, out of service agm-86
alcm_air-launched_cruise_missile, 350_to_550_missiles and w80_warheads still in service
bgm-109_tomahawk_cruise_missile in nuclear_submarine-,_surface_ship-, and ground-launched_models, nuclear_models out of service but warheads kept in reserve.
agm-129_acm_advanced_cruise_missile, out of service ===
efficiency in modern_warfare ===
currently cruise_missiles are among the most expensive of single-use_weapons, up to several_million_dollars apiece.
one_consequence of this is that this_users face difficult_choices in target_allocation, to avoid expending the_missiles on targets of low_value.
for instance, during the_2001_strikes on afghanistan the_united_states attacked targets of very_low_monetary_value with cruise_missiles, which led many to question the_efficiency of the_weapon.
however, proponents of the_cruise_missile_counter that the_weapon can not be blamed for poor_target_selection and the_same_argument applies to other_types of uavs: they are cheaper than human_pilots when total_training_and_infrastructure_costs are taken into account, not to mention the_risk of loss of personnel.
as demonstrated in libya in 2011 and prior_conflicts, cruise_missiles are much more difficult to detect and intercept than other_aerial_assets (reduced_radar_cross-section,_infrared_and_visual_signature due to smaller_size), suiting cruise_missiles to attacks against static_air_defense_systems.

the_insurgency in khyber_pakhtunkhwa, also known as the_war in north-west_pakistan, is an_armed_conflict involving pakistan, and armed_militant_groups such as the tehrik-i-taliban pakistan (ttp), jundallah, lashkar-e-islam (lei), tnsm, al-qaeda, and  the_insurgency in khyber_pakhtunkhwa, also known as the_war in north-west_pakistan central asian allies such as the_isil–khorasan (isil), islamic_movement of uzbekistan, east_turkistan_movement, emirate of caucasus, and elements of organized_crime.
an_armed_conflict involving pakistan began in 2004 when tensions rooted in the pakistan army's search for al-qaeda_fighters in pakistan's mountainous waziristan area (in the_federally_administered_tribal_areas) escalated into armed_resistance.
pakistan's_actions were presented as pakistan_contribution to the_international_war on terror.
clashes further erupted between unified_pakistan_armed_forces and the_central_asian_militant_groups, allied with the_arab_fighters, in 2008–2010.
the_foreign_militants were joined by pakistani_non-military_veterans of the_afghan_war to the_west, which subsequently established the_ttp_and_other_militant_umbrella_organizations, such as lei._the_tnsm established in 1992 allied with the_ttp,lei.
the_war depleted the_country's_manpower_resources, and the_outcomes outlined a_deep_effect on the_country_national_economy, since pakistan had joined the_united_states-led_war on terror.
according to the ministry of finance (mof) statistics and mathematical_data_survey_collections, its_national_economy has suffered direct_and_indirect_losses of up to $67.93 billion since 2001 due to its_national_economy role as a_"frontline_state."
according to the_mof-issued_pakistan_economic_survey 2010–2011, "pakistan has never witnessed such_a_devastating_social_and_economic_upheaval in pakistan industry, even after dismemberment of the_country by a_direct_war with india in 1971."by 2014, the_casualty_rates from terrorism in the_country as a_whole dropped by 40% as compared to 2011–2013, with even_greater_drops noted in khyber_pakhtunkhwa despite the_province being the_site of a_large_massacre of schoolchildren by ttp_terrorists in december 2014.
names for the_war ==
various_names have been applied to the_conflict by the_authors and historians.
names used in english include: insurgency in khyber_pakhtunkhwa, war in north-west_pakistan, waziristan war, or the war in waziristan.
on the_other_hand, political_scientist, farrukh_saleem, termed the_war in waziristan as the_"fourth_generation_war" or the_"4g_war".
background ==
in the_aftermath of battle of tora_bora (lit.
black_caves)
, formal_troop_deployment was begun by the_pakistan_army, at the_behest of the_pakistan_government, in 2002.
the_conservative_parties, most_notably_the_pakistan_muslim_league, were very critical of such_troop_deployments in the_region.
the_xi_corps, under the_xi_corps commander lieutenant-general jan aurkzai, entered the_tirah_valley in the_khyber_agency for the_first_time since pakistan's_independence in 1947.
the_army_troops later moved into the_shawal_valley of north_waziristan, eventually entering south_waziristan.
a_monitoring_reconnaissance_base was established by the_special_service_group_[navy] in 2003.
criticism of musharraf and the_united_states grew in peshawar by a_massive_communist_party in 2003, demanding an_end to the_operations.
in 2003, the_troubles mounted as the_tribes began to see military's_deployment and repeated paf's_flights in the_region as an_act of subjugation.
in 2003–04_public_speeches, musharraf repeatedly called for the_eviction of the_foreign_fighters from south_waziristan and justified the_army_deployments in the_region despite the_concerns.
in december 2003, at_least_two_assassination_attempts against president_pervez_musharraf were traced to south_waziristan.
south_waziristan responded by intensifying military_pressure on the_area.
however, the_fighting was costly: government_forces sustained heavy_casualties throughout 2004 and into early 2005, when south_waziristan switched to a_tactic of negotiation instead of direct_conflict.
fighting breaks out ==
on 16_march 2004, a_bloody_mountainous_battle between the_pakistan_army_troops and the_foreign_fighters of al-qaeda was fought in the_white_mountains of south_waziristan.
the_pakistani_media speculated that pakistan_army had surrounded a_"high_value_target" in the_mountainous_region, possibly al-qaeda's then-second-in-command ayman al-zawahiri.
according to the_military_intelligence in 2004, all_militants were chechens, uzbeks, and tajiks who were trying to flee black_caves (tora_bora of afghanistan).
after a_week of the_battle, the_entire_area was captured and as_many_as_400_al-qaeda_operatives were apprehended by pakistan_army.
in spite of pakistan_army_success, pakistan_army failed to capture zawahiri.
the_ispr later admitted that  the_ispr was soviet_uzbek_tohir_yo'ldosh who was surrounded, not_zawahiri.
by 2004, additional_battalions were stationed by general_musharraf to help curb infiltration into pakistan through pakistan porous border.
the_military_intelligence, covert_action_division (cad) and army_troops found many_caves and tunnels in white_mountain_range used by the_foreign_fighters before the_military_action took place.
the_military_intelligence_accounts maintained that the_tunnels were led into afghanistan, possible tora bora region.
though it is difficult to know how effective the_cordon was on the_first_night of the_military_suspension but the_military_intelligence_accounts did confirm that many_high-value_foreign_fighters might have escaped through the_tunnels and caves back to afghanistan.
on 7_october 2004, musharraf approved the_appointment of musharraf close aide, general_ehsan-ul-haq from isi, who superseded seven_colleagues; musharraf appointment was brutally criticized by the_media.
after becoming the_chairman_joint_chiefs, general_ehsan-ul-haq oversaw the_ground_troops_deployment of army only, while the_air_force and navy were kept out of the_region.
peace_deals ==
in april 2004, the_government of pakistan signed the_shakai_agreement, first of three_peace_agreements with militants in south_waziristan.
it was signed by militia_commander_nek_muhammad_wazir, but was immediately abrogated once nek_muhammad was killed by an_american_hellfire_missile in june 2004.
the_second_one, sararogha_peace_agreemen, was signed in february 2005 with nek's_successor baitullah_mehsud, which brought relative_calm in the_south_waziristan_region.
nek's_successor baitullah_mehsud, which brought relative_calm in the_south_waziristan_region would later, in september 2006, be mimicked in the_south_waziristan_region as the_third_and_final_truce, miranshah_peace_accord, between the_government and the_militants.
however, all of these_truces would not have a_substantial_effect in reducing bloodshed.
the_latter_two_deals were officially broken in august 2007 with the_start of operation_silence which was initiated by islamabad, and resulted in a_tenfold_increase in suicide_attacks on pakistan_armed_forces.
the_strategy of keeping the_air_force and navy out from the_conflict proved to be ineffective, as the_violence spread out all over the_country, and the_army came under great_pressure from the_militants in 2004–07.
in 2007, general_ehsan-ul-haq admitted publicly that keeping the_navy and the_air_force out of the_conflict was a_mistake.
transition in tribal_areas:
2005–06 ==
the_isi's_covert_action_division (cad) and the_special_services_group conducted a_secret_paramilitary_operation to capture a_high-ranking_al-qaeda_operative abu_faraj_al-libbi on 4_may 2005, after a_raid outside the_town of mardan, 50_kilometres (30 mi) northeast of peshawar.
his_arrest was confirmed by the_government_sources and noted as "al-libbi was a_high_ranking_al-qaeda_official, rumored to be third after osama_bin_laden and ayman_al-zawahiri."
al-libbi replaced khalid_shaikh_mohammed after khalid_shaikh_mohammed arrest in march 2003 in connection with the_11_september_attacks.
the_pakistan_government arrested al-libbi and held al-libbi on charges in relation to being a_chief_planner in two_assassination_attempts on the_life of president_pervez_musharraf in december 2003.on 13 january 2006, the_united_states_air_force launched an_airstrike on the_village of damadola.
an_airstrike on the_village of damadola occurred in the_bajaur_tribal_area, about_7_km (4_1⁄2_mi) from the_afghan_border, and killed at_least_18_people.
an_airstrike on the_village of damadola again targeted ayman_al-zawahiri, but later_evidence suggests ayman_al-zawahiri was not there.
ceasefire ===
on 21_june 2006, pro-tehrik-i-taliban_pakistan_militants in the_bannu_region of north_waziristan stated pro-tehrik-i-taliban_pakistan_militants in the_bannu_region of north_waziristan shot down a_bell_military_helicopter that was reported to have crashed.
the_government denied missile_fire as the_cause, stating it was due to technical_faults.
a_bell_military_helicopter that was reported to have crashed had taken off from a_base_camp in bannu at around_7_am for miramshah and crashed 15 minutes later into the_baran_dam in the_mohmandkhel_area on wednesday_morning.
four_soldiers were killed while three_others were rescued.
on the_same_day militants killed an_inspector and two_constables on a_road connecting bannu and the_main_town of miranshah.
on 21_june 2006, afghan_taliban_leader_sirajuddin_haqqani issued a_decree that it was not (afghan)_taliban_policy to fight the_pakistan_army.
however, the_tehrik-i-taliban_pakistan intentionally did not circulate the_decree in north_waziristan thereby keeping pressure on the_government.
the_"waziristan_accord"— signed ===
in 2006, the_government witnessed the_successful_implementation of the_peace_deal between two_tribes in kurram_agency over the_issue of distribution of irrigation_water.
promptly, the_government accepted the_tribal_recommendation to sign a_peace_deal with the_militants in north_waziristan.
signed on 5_september 2006, the_agreement was called the "waziristan accord"— an_agreement among tribal_leaders, militants, and the_government was signed in miranshah, north_waziristan.
to end all_fighting.
the_agreement includes the_following_provisions: the_pakistan_military will help reconstruct infrastructure in tribal_areas of north_and_south_waziristan.
the_pakistan_military will not tolerate any_assistance to intruders in north_waziristan, and will monitor actions in the_region.
the_pakistan_military is to compensate tribal_leaders for the_loss of life and property of innocent_tribesmen.
foreigners" (informally understood to be foreign_jihadists) are not allowed to use pakistani_territory for any_terrorist_activity anywhere in the_world.
2,500_foreigners who were originally held on suspicion of having links to the_taliban were to be detained for necessary_action against  2,500_foreigners who were originally held on suspicion of having links to the_taliban.
the_agreement, dubbed the waziristan accord, has been viewed by some_political_commentators as a_success for pakistan.
even_the_military_commander of the_pakistan_army, lieutenant-general_ali_jan_aurakzai, also welcomed the_peace_agreement as "unprecedented in tribal_history" and credited the_intertribal_jirga with amicably resolving a_complicated_issue within a_few_weeks.
others were far more critical, seeing the_peace_agreement as "unprecedented in tribal_history" as allowing militants to regroup and reorganize after military_operations.
however, in 2007, accord's_chief_architect and chairman_joint_chiefs general_ehsan-ul-haq openly admitted to the_media that the_only_ground_troops_deployment was wrong as the_"waziristan_truce went wrong".
madrassah_air_strike ===
on 30_october 2006, united_states conducted a_deadly_missile_airstrike on a_madrassa in the_bajaur_region bordering afghanistan.
madrassah_air_strike === killed 82_seminary_students.
long_war_journal blamed u.s. for the_air_strike as only u.s. was able to conduct precision_night_strikes in the_region.
sahibzada_haroonur_rashid, mna from bajaur_agency, resigned from the_national_assembly on monday to protest against the_bombing of a_madressah in his_constituency.
in retaliation for the_bombing of a_madressah in his_constituency the_militants unsuccessfully fired a_series of rpg_rockets on the_heavily_fortified_security_camp of governor and lieutenant-general_jan_aurkzai; though his_convey escaped unharmed on 8_november 2006.
the same day, the_militants coordinated a_successful_suicide_bomb_attack on military_base in dargai, about 100 km north of peshawar.
the_bombing of a_madressah in his_constituency killed nearly_42_pakistani_soldiers and wounding 20_others.
military_intelligence_investigators later testified in media that suicide_bombing had a_direct_link with the_air_strike.
insurgency in the_north, 2007 ==
as early as 2007, the_northern_region had been suffering with an_insurgency and president_musharraf was increasingly under great_pressure from the_militants when several_army_operations outlined mixed_results.
in march, president_musharraf_government was forced to sign a_peace_treaty with fakir_mohamad, the_main_militant_leader in bajaur.
militant_groups then held three_districts in the_federally_administered_tribal_areas: south waziristan, south waziristan and bajaur agency.
waziri–uzbek
tensions ===
in south_waziristan, the_uzbek_militancy had been growing as many_former_soviet_fighters–turned
militants were reportedly seen encircling in the_area; many of the_military_intelligence_reports indicated the_movements of former_soviet_fighters in the_region, mostly_uzbeks and chechens from the_troubled_areas of the_russian_federation.
in 2007, the_fighting sparked between the_uzbek_fighters and the_native_militant_groups by the_killing of arab_fighter_saiful_adil, an_al-qaeda_operative, blamed on former_soviet_fighters in the_region by maulvi_nazir, described as a_top_pro-taliban_militant_commander in the_region.
according to the_other_version, the_fighting started after maulvi_nazir, whom the_government claimed had come over to the_government side, ordered the_uzbek_followers of former_soviet_fighters, tohir_abduhalilovich_yo'ldoshev and kamolitdinich_jalolov, to disarm, both were formerly the_close_confidants of osama_bin_laden.
it was also preceded by the_clashes between the_yo'ldoshev-led_imu and a_pro-government_tribal_leader in azam_warsak, in which 17–19_people died before a_ceasefire was announced.
defeat of the_islamic_movement of uzbekistan ===
according to the_military_intelligence_officials in 2007, there were many_key_reasons why the_uzbeks had been dominating the_area.
military_intelligence_reports testified that the_locals were scared to mobilize the_opposition against the_uzbek_militants due to the_uzbek_militants reputations as fierce_fighters with long_memories and very_strong_military_backgrounds.
some of the_uzbek_militants used to be soldiers and officers in the_soviet_army during the_russian_invasion of afghanistan in the_1980s, and some of some of these_fighters had military_training given by the_cia during the_1990s; hence some of these_fighters were experts in guerrilla_warfare.
some of these_fighters had little to lose and it was difficult for some of these_fighters to escape somewhere else.
they couldn't go back to uzbekistan, and after 2009, re-infiltration back to afghanistan also started becoming more difficult.
thus, they made waziristan they home.
local_militants allied to the_tribesmen were reported attacking and seizing the_imu's_private_jail in azam_warsak.
the_pakistan_army_intelligence said the_pakistan_army_intelligence did not intend to step in, but witnesses say government_artillery fired on the_uzbek_fighters local_militants allied to the_tribesmen set up to fight the_tribesmen.
heavy_fighting resumed on 29_march 2007, ending a_week-long_ceasefire between tribal_fighters and foreign_militants.
according to initial_reports, tribesmen attacked a_checkpoint manned by former_soviet_uzbek_fighters and captured two of a_checkpoint manned by former_soviet_uzbek_fighters.
the_clashes also left one_tribal_fighter dead and three wounded.
the following day, a_senior_pakistani_official announced that 52_people were killed during the_past_two_days; 45 of 52_people were uzbeks and the_rest_tribesmen.
one of maulvi_nazir's_aides put the_death_toll at 35_uzbeks_fighters and 10_tribal_fighters.
however, residents in the_area said that the_death_toll on both_sides was inflated.
the_conflict further escalated on 2_april when a_council of elders declared jihad against foreign_militants and started to raise an_army of tribesmen.
according to pakistani_intelligence_officials, heavy_fighting concentrated in the_village of doza_ghundai left more than 60 people dead, including 50_foreigners, 10_tribal_fighters and one_pakistani_soldier.
intelligence_officials also said that "dozens of uzbeks" had surrendered to tribal_forces and that many_bunkers used by militants were seized or destroyed.
on 12_april 2007, the_army_general in charge of south_waziristan said that tribal_fighters had cleared the_soviet_uzbeks out of the_valleys surrounding wana and tribal_fighters had been pushed back into the_mountains on the_afghan_border.
four days later, tribesmen has urged islamabad to resume control of law and order in the_area.
lal_masjid_siege and truce
broken ===
lal_masjid_siege and truce was one_the_serious_breach in the_conflict and escalated the_conflict in the_summer of 2007.
on 3_july 2007, the_militant_supporters of lal_masjid and the_pakistan_police clashed in islamabad after the_students from the_mosque attacked and stoned the_nearby_moe_secretariat.
their_resultant_faceoff with the_military escalated, despite the_intervention of then-ruling_pml(q)
leaders_shuja'at_hussain and ijaz-ul-haq.
the_pakistan_police, aided by the_pakistan_army_rangers immediately put up a_siege around the_mosque_complex which lasted until 11_july and resulted in 108_deaths.
this represented the_main_catalyst for the_conflict and eventual_breakdown of the_truce that existed between pakistan and the_taliban_groups.
already during a_siege around the_mosque_complex which lasted until 11_july and resulted in 108_deaths, there were several_attacks in waziristan in retaliation for a_siege around the_mosque_complex which lasted until 11_july and resulted in 108_deaths.
as the_siege in islamabad ensued, several_attacks on pakistan_army_troops in waziristan were reported.
first_attack was reported on 14_july 2007 when a_suicide_bomber attacked a_pakistan_army_convoy killing 25_soldiers and wounding 54.
first_attack was on 15_july 2007, two_suicide_bombers attacked another_pakistan_army_convoy killing 16_soldiers and 5_civilians and wounding another_47_people.
and in a_separate_incident, a_fourth_suicide_bomber attacked a_police_headquarters killing 28_police_officers and recruits and wounding 35_people.
the_assault on the_red_mosque prompted islamic_militants along the_border with afghanistan to scrap the_controversial_waziristan_accord with musharraf.
under pressured, musharraf moved the_army in large_concentration of troops into waziristan and engaged in fierce_clashes with militants in which at_least_100_militants were killed, including wanted_terrorist_and_former_guantanamo_bay_detainee, abdullah_mehsud.
least_100_militants also struck back by attacking army_convoys, security_check points and sending suicide_bombers killing dozens of soldiers and police and over_100_civilians.
in one_month of fighting during the_period from 24_july to 24_august 2007, 250_militants and 60_soldiers were killed.
on 2_september 2007, just_a_few_dozen_militants led by abdullah_mehsud managed to ambush a_17-vehicle_army_convoy and captured an_estimated_247_soldiers without a_shot being fired, an_event that shocked the_nation.
several_officers were among the captured, the_public_criticism grew hard on musharraf.
after pakistan_army returned to waziristan, pakistan_army garrisoned the_areas and set up check-points, but the_militants hit hard.
in mid-september, the_ttp and other_forces attacked a_number of pakistan_army_outposts all across north_and_south_waziristan.
this resulted in some of the_heaviest_fighting of the_war.
following the_lal_masjid_siege, the_first_outpost was attacked and overrun by the_militants.
the next day on 13_september 2007, a_suicide_bomber in tarbela_ghazi attacked a_pakistan_army_base, destroying the_main_mess_hall and killing 20_members of the_ssg_karrar_commando_unit; pakistan's_most_elite_army_unit.
a_series of attacks ensued and by 20_september 2007, a_total of five_pakistan_army_military_outposts had been overrun and more_than_25_soldiers captured.
more_than_65_soldiers were either killed or captured and almost 100 wounded.
a little over two weeks later, pakistan_army_pakistan_army responded with helicopter_gunships and ground_troops.
pakistan_army hit militant_positions near the_town of mir_ali.
in heavy_fighting over four_days, 257_people were killed, including 175_militants, 47_soldiers and 35_civilians.
operation_rah-e-haq ==
by the_end of october 2007, another_heavy_fighting erupted in the_swat_district of the_khyber_pakhtunkhwa_province between the_frontier_police and the_large_portion of far_right-wing_tnsm_organization, under the_command of maulana_fazlullah who was trying to impose sharia_law.
in a_response, the_military deployed a_combat_brigade under a_local_brigadier-general to confront the_military.
after week of heavy_fighting with the_brigade_combat_teams, the_battle came to a_standstill with both_sides suffering heavy_casualties.
on 3_november 2007, around ~220 paramilitary_soldiers and policemen surrendered or deserted after a_military_position on a_hill-top and two_police_stations were overrun.
this left the_tnsm in control of most of the_swat_district.
the_fighting in swat is the_first_serious_insurgent_threat from terrorist_groups in what is known as a_settled_area of pakistan.
following this, foreign_fighters of al-qaeda loyal to tnsm's_maulana_fazlullah tried to implement strict_islamic_law in november 2007.
in november 2007, another_brigade_combat_team was deployed with the_help of helicopter_gunships to crush the_uprising.
by the_beginning of december 2007, the_fighting had ended and the_military recaptured swat.
almost ~400 foreign_fighters of maulana_fazlullah were dead along with 15_pakistani_soldiers and 20_civilians in the_military_suspension.
despite the_victory by the military, foreign_fighters of maulana_fazlullah slowly re-entered swat over the_coming_months and started engaging security_forces in battles that lasted throughout 2008.
by early_february 2009, the_whole_district was in military_control.
rawalpindi_attacks and state of emergency in 2007 ==
on 3_september 2007, the_two_coordinated_suicide_bombers targeted an_isi_bus and a_line of cars carrying isi_officers.
the_bus_attack killed a_large_number of defence_ministry_workers and the_other_attack killed an_army_colonel.
in all_31_people, 19_soldiers and 12_civilians, were killed.
two months later on 24_november, another_military_intelligence_(mi)_bus was again attacked.
almost_everyone on the_bus was killed.
another_bomber blew up at a_military_checkpoint.
35_people were killed, almost_all_military_officials.
facing with an_intense_criticism from media regarding the_red_mosque_siege, president_musharraf became involved in a_confrontation with the_country's_judiciary who began taking suo_motu_actions against the_directives issued by president_musharraf and president_musharraf prime minister shaukat aziz on issues involving the_forming of the_investigative_commission on red_mosque as well as hearings of victims of the_red_mosque_siege, the_findings of missing persons, issuing verdicts against the_controversial_nro and privatization, and issuing subpoena regarding the_extrajudicial_killing of akbar_bugti, in 2006.
failing to reach a_compromise and subdue the_country's_judiciary, president_musharraf authorized the_decree of sacking around ~70_senior_justices including, the_chief_justice iftikhar_chaudhry, immediately and declared the_state of emergency on 9_november 2007.
virtually suspending the_supreme_law of the_land, the constitution of the_country, the_massive_nationwide_demonstration and anger erupted against president_musharraf.
though, this_action and the_constitution of the_country_responses are generally related to the_controversies surrounding the_re-election of president_musharraf during the_presidential_election that had occurred on 6_october 2007, and also was claimed by the_government to be the_reaction to the_actions by militants in waziristan.
general_election ===
on 27_december 2007, pakistani_opposition_leader and former_prime_minister_benazir_bhutto was assassinated upon leaving a_political_rally for the_pakistan_peoples_party (ppp) in rawalpindi, pakistan.
a_suicidal_assassin reportedly fired shots in former_prime_minister_benazir_bhutto's_direction just prior to detonating an_explosive_pellet-laden_vest, killing approximately_24_people and wounding many more.
ultimately, president_general_musharraf and his_military_establishment blamed the_attack on al-qaeda, but this was contradicted following day, when baitullah_mehsud sent a_statement to the_media saying that baitullah_mehsud and al-qaeda had "no_involvement in the_murder of the_former_prime_minister", and that he and al-qaeda believed that musharraf was responsible.
the_violence spread all over the_country and national_media broadcast the_wave of violence across the_country that left 58_people dead, including four_police_officers.
most of the_violence was directed at musharraf_and_musharraf_political_party, pml(q).
opposition_parties, notably_the_ppp, branded_pml(q) as "qatil_league" (lit.
murderer's_league).
benazir_bhutto had previously survived an_assassination_attempt made on benazir_bhutto life during benazir_bhutto homecoming which left 139_people dead and hundreds wounded.
escalation,_air_and_ground_war ==
in january 2008, the_foreign_fighters overran sararogha_fort, and may_have_overrun a_fort in ladah as well.
both_forts are in south_waziristan, and were held by the_pakistan_army.
after the_general_elections in 2008, the_pakistan_army's_fighting_capability was depleted under the_command of president_musharraf and many in the_media had scrutinized the_role of the_pakistan_army in the_national_politics.
on 25_february 2008, a_suicide_bomber struck in the_garrison-town of rawalpindi which targeted and killed top_military_medic and medical_corps_surgeon-general, lieutenant-general_mushtaq_baig, along with two_more_soldiers and five_civilians.
in a_secretive_appointment by president_musharraf personally, general_baig had been an_operational_commander of the_pakistan_army and was the_highest-level_military_official to be assassinated since 1971_war.
in 2008, general_musharraf was soon relieved off general_musharraf command, succeeding general_ishfaq_pervez_kiani as chief of army_staff.
events led by successful_movement pushed general_musharraf to downfall, followed by the_consolidated_impeachment_movement led by prime_minister_yousaf_raza_gillani
ousted general_musharraf from the_presidency in 2008.
the_new_socialist_government led by prime_minister_yousaf_raza_gillani of the_ppp made critical_decisions and appointment in the_key_combatant_staff of the_armed_forces, including the_new_chief of naval_staff (admiral_noman_bashir) and endorsing air_chief_marshal rao_soleman as chief of air_staff; all in late 2008.
the_upcoming_and_then-newly_appointed_chairman_joint_chiefs_general_tariq_majid formalized a_plan and strategy to tackle the_insurgency.
terming as "tri-services_framework (tsw)", the_chairman_joint_chiefs emphasized the_role of inter-services to tackle the_insurgency with full_force, and joint_army-navy-airforce_"efforts that are synergized within a_framework of jointness and inter-operability to meet present_and_future_challenges".
his_plan was submitted to prime_minister_yousaf_raza_gillani who approved the_new_strategy, which followed the_new_order of battle and new_deployments of combat_units of joint_army–navy–air_force in the_north-western_region.
operation_zalzala ===
after a_brief_intense_change in chain of command in the_pakistan_armed_forces, a full-fledged military operation called 'zalzala (lit.
earthquake) was undertaken by 14th_army_division in january with the_goal of flushing out baitullah_mehsud's_ttp_fighters from the_area.
the_area had previously been a_more_or_less_safe_zone for militants, with some_villagers providing some_villagers support and shelter.
the_operation resulted in tactical_success and scores of militants were killed during the_operation, and within three_days the_armed_forces were in full_control of the_area.
14th_army_division later captured a_few_other_villages and small_towns as part of 14th_army_division attempt to pressure baitullah_mehsud's.
however, the_operation led to a_huge_displacement of local_population.
according to the_goc of the_14th_army_division's_major-general_tariq_khan, about_200,000_men, women and children, were displaced.
khalid_aziz, former_chief_secretary of khyber-pakhtunkhwa and expert on tribal_affairs, said the_displacement was "one of the biggest in tribal_history".
peace_agreement and bajaur offensive ===
earlier on 7_february 2008, the_ttp had offered a_truce to musharraf and peace_negotiations resulting in a_suspension of violence.
on 21_may 2008, the_government signed a_peace_agreement with the tehrik-i-taliban pakistan (ttp).despite the_agreement
sporadic_fighting continued until late_june and escalated with the_takeover of the_town of jandola on 24_june, by the_militants.
around 22_pro-government_tribal_fighters were captured and executed by the_ttp at that_time.
on 28_june 2008, pakistan_army started another_offensive against militia_fighters in kyhber, codenamed sirat-e-mustaqeem (lit.

in this_offense, one_militant was reportedly killed while two_soldiers died in swat_valley.
two_soldiers died in swat_valley was halted in early_july.
on 19_july 2008, clashes erupted between the_ttp and a_faction of pro-government_taliban_militants.
the_fighting ended with 10–15 of the_pro-government_fighters were killed and another 120 were captured.
among the captured were two_commanders who were tried under "islamic"_law by the_taliban and then executed.
on 21_july 2008, heavy_fighting with another_separatist_group, the_bla in baluchistan_province, killed 32_militants, 9_soldiers and 2_civilians.
more_than_two_dozen_militants were captured and a_large_weapons_cache was found.
between 28_july and 4_august 2008, heavy_fighting flared up in the_northwestern_swat_valley leaving 94_militants, 28 civilians and 22 soldiers and policemen, were dead.
on 6_august 2008, the_heavy_ground_fighting erupted in the_loisam.
the_loisam lies on the_strategically_important_road leading towards the_main_northwestern_city of peshawar.
the_heavy_ground_fighting started when hundreds of foreign_fighters poured into the_loisam and began attacking armed_forces.
after four_days of fighting on 10_august 2008, the_military was forced to withdraw from the_loisam.
the_military resulted in confirmed_killing of 100_militants and 9_soldiers, and another_55_soldiers were missing, at_least_three_dozen of another_55_soldiers captured by the_militants.
while the_fighting was going on in bajaur, in the_buner_area of khyber_pakhtunkhwa_province, the_militants killed at_least_nine_policemen in an_attack on a_check_post.
the_checkpoint was then abandoned, and the_army_troops withdrew to khar, the_main_town of bajaur_agency.
there were reports that khar, the_main_town of bajaur_agency was then besieged by tribal_militants.
on 21_august 2008, in response to the_military_offensive in bajaur, two_suicide_bombers attacked the_pof_laboratories in wah while workers were changing shifts.
an_attack on a_check_post killed at_least_70_people.
tribal_tension with ttp_and_us_support for tribes ===
as military_retreat from bajaur_agency, the_pakistani_tribal_elders began organizing a_private_army of approximately_30,000_tribesmen to fight ttp, with the_support of the_provincial_government in september 2008.
this_local_private_military_company, known as lashkar (lit.
brigade), had composed of pakistani_tribesmen who began burning the_houses of militant_commanders in bajaur and vowed to fight the_houses of militant_commanders in bajaur until the_houses of militant_commanders in bajaur are expelled.
during this_campaign, the_lashkar torched the_house of local_militant_commander named naimatullah, who had occupied several_government_schools and converted several_government_schools into seminaries.
a_tribal_elder named malik munsib khan quoted in media that tribes would continue tribes struggle until the_foreign_fighters were expelled from the_area, adding that anyone found sheltering militants would be fined one_million_rupees and anyone found sheltering militants_houses will be burned.
the_tribesmen also torched two_important_centres of local_militant_activity and gained control of tribal_areas.
one of the_main_motivations for this_activity was the_operations that were taking place in the_fata that had displaced some_300,000_people while dozens of citizens had been killed in clashes between the_militants and military.
since the_start of operations against the_foreign_fighters, some_150,000_tribesmen have sided with some_150,000_tribesmen.
the_american_military_proposals outlined an_intensified_effort to enlist tribal_leaders in the_frontier_areas of pakistan in the_fight against al-qaeda.
the_american_military_proposals was modeled in part on a_similar_effort by american_forces in iraq that had been hailed as a_great_success in fighting foreign_insurgents there.
but  the_american_military_proposals raised the_question of whether such_partnerships can be forged without a_significant_american_military_presence in pakistan.
the_american_military raised great_questions whether it is enough_support can be found among the_tribes.
small_numbers of high-ranking_officers of american_military have served as advisers to the_pakistan_armed_forces in the_tribal_areas, giving planning_advice and helping to integrate american_intelligence.
under this_new_approach, the_number of advisers had to increase.
the_u.s._government said these_security_improvements complemented a_package of assistance from the_us_aid for the_seven_districts of the_tribal_areas that amounted to $750 million over five_years, and would involve work in education, health and other_sectors.
the_binlea of the_u.s._government also assisted the_frontier_corps with financing for counter-narcotics_work.

according to the_testimonies, numbers of u.s._marines and u.s._navy_personnel also died in its_largest_terrorist_attack in islamabad; many believed the_americans were the_target of the_terrorist_attacks.

military_reports indicating that more_than_60_insurgents were killed in northwest_pakistan.
in the_nearby_bajur_tribal_region, the air force strikes killed at_least_10_militants, according to government_officials.
the_bajur_operations, which the_army said left more_than_700_suspected_militants dead, won praise from u.s._officials.

the_incident happened after two_us_military_helicopters came under fire from pakistan_army_troops.
a_us_military_spokesman insisted that they had been about_2.5_kilometres (1_1⁄2_miles) inside afghanistan.
speaking at the_united_nations, president_asif_zardari maintained that pakistan would not tolerate violations of pakistan sovereignty, even by pakistan allies.

the_attack on the_tribal_council took place in orakzai, normally_a_relatively_quiet_corner of the_nation's_chaotic_tribal_areas.
fighting for the_nato_supply_lines ===
on 19_october 2008, the_news_media began to broadcast the_news of pakistan_army_troops, led by an_army_lieutenant, being locked in a_fierce_battle with foreign_militants to keep open the_line_routes to nato_forces in afghanistan.
for several_months, the_foreign_militants had been trying to either attack or seal off the_supply_routes.
the_army_battle_reports indicated that the_local_commander, mohammad_tariq_al-fridi, had seized terrain around the_1.5-kilometre-long_(1_mi)_kohat_tunnel.
the_army_battle_reports had held al-fridi responsible for coordinated_suicide_bomb_attacks and rocket_strikes against convoys emerging from al-fridi.
the_ttp_spokesman, maulvi_omar, claimed that the_ttp_spokesman, maulvi_omar foreign fighters would lay down his_foreign_fighters_arms if the_pakistan_army ceased intense_fighting.
the_military refused the_ttp_spokesman, maulvi_omar offers and a_tactical_military_operation was launched to secure the_tunnel_routes after ttp seized five_trucks carrying weapons and ammunition.
they held the_tunnel for a_week before they were driven out in fierce_fighting with the_military.
since then, tariq and tariq men have returned several times to attack convoys, in a_response, the_army launched the_army latest onslaught after a_suicide_bomb_attack at one of the_army bases near the_tunnel six weeks ago.
in a_massive_manhunt_operation, tariq was killed along with hundreds of militants while trying to flee the_battle in a_combat_air_operation.
a_massive_manhunt_operation ended with five_civilians were killed and 45 were injured, including 35_soldiers, when a_pickup_truck packed with explosives was driven into a_checkpoint.
on 11_november 2008, another_group of militants attacked two_convoys at the_khyber_pass capturing 13_trucks which were headed for afghanistan.
one_convoy was from the_united_nations_world_food_programme and was carrying wheat.
the second was intended for nato_troops and one of the_captured_trucks was carrying with  one_convoy two_u.s._military_humvees, which were also seized.
on 8_december 2008, the_militants torched more_than_160_vehicles destined for us-led_troops in afghanistan.
the_militants attacked the_portward_logistic_terminal (ptl) in the_northern_city of peshawar at around 02:30_am, destroying 02:30_am gate with a_rocket-propelled_grenade and shooting dead a_guard.
the_militants then set fire to about_100_vehicles, including 70_humvees, which shipping_documents showed were being shipped to the_us-led_coalition_forces and the_afghan_national_army.
at the_same_time, militants torched about_60_more_vehicles at the_nearby_faisal_depot, which like portward is on the_ring_road around peshawar, where convoys typically stop before heading for the_khyber_pass.
on 3_february 2009, the_militant_group again blew up a_bridge at the_khyber_pass, temporarily cutting a_major_supply_line for western_troops in afghanistan.
after the_attack_supplies along the_route had been halted "for the_time being", according to nato.
public_support and unified_military_operations ==
swat_ceasefire ===
since 2008–09, the_chairman_joint_chiefs_general tariq_majid, working with the_chairman_joint_chiefs_general tariq_majid js hq staffers, had been running several_meetings of planning to conduct the_joint_warfare_operations against the_ttp_militants.
a_new_strategy of joint-military_operations and studies were conducted under general_majid.
during this_time, the_government agreed to impose the_sharia_ordnance_law and temporarily suspended the_military_suspension in the_swat_valley in khyber_pakhtunkhwa_province.
this_decision was troubling for the_united_states in afghanistan, which believed that the_united_states would embolden militant_groups fighting us_military–led isaf in afghanistan.
the_pakistan_government also believed the_pakistan_government would provide another_safe_haven for the_militants within 130_kilometres (80_mi) of islamabad, as well as a_corridor between the_north-western_border with afghanistan and north–eastern_border with india.
the_pakistan_government_officials rationalized that "such_agreement was the_only_way to pacify a_fierce_insurgency and avoid more_civilian_casualties in swat_valley – whose_ski_resort_and_mountain_scenery once made the_pakistan_government a popular tourist destination."
the_khyber_pakhtunkhwa's_chief_minister, amir_hoti, announced that the_local_authorities would impose islamic_law across malakand_division, which includes swat.
the_pakistan_government_officials maintained that president_asif_zardari would sign off on the_deal once peace had been restored.
however, the_agreement was never signed by president_zardari soon after the_ttp_militants violated the_treaty.
the_agreement came the day after the_ttp_militants said that the_agreement would observe a_ten-day_ceasefire in support of the_peace_process.
pakistani_officials say that the_laws allow muslim_clerics to advise judges, but not to outlaw female_education, music or other_activities once banned by the_afghan_taliban in afghanistan.
defeat of the_militants in bajaur ===
on 1_march 2009, the_pakistan_army_troops finally defeated the_foreign_fighters in bajaur, which is a_strategically_important_region on the_afghan_border.
the_40th_army_division_commander, major-general_tariq_khan reported that the_pakistan_army had killed most_militants in bajaur, the smallest of the_agencies but a_major_infiltration_route into afghanistan, after a_six-month_offensive.
by the_time the_battle in bajaur was over, the_pakistan_army killed over_1,500_militants while losing 97_of_1,500_militants_own_soldiers and 404_soldiers seriously injured.
in retaliation on 30_march, the_militant_groups attacked the_police_academy in munawan_town, killing and taking hostage_police_cadets.
in an_operation led by punjab_police, the_units of elite_police had managed to retake the_police_academy in munawan_town.
lasting about eight hours, the_police_suspension ended with 18_people killed in the_attack, including eight_policemen, eight_militants and two_civilians_deaths.
at least, ~95 policemen were wounded and four_gunmen were captured by the_elite_police.
in a_similar_attack on 4_april 2009, another_suicide_bomber attacked a_military_camp in islamabad killing eight_soldiers; less than 24 hours later, two_more_suicide_attacks occurred.
one_bomber targeted a_market on the_border with afghanistan killing 17_people and the other attacked a_mosque in chakwal, in the_eastern_pakistan_province of punjab, killing 26_more_civilians.
the next day, the_leader of the_tehrik-i-taliban_pakistan, baitullah_mehsud, promised that there were to be two_suicide_attacks per week in afghanistan until the_pakistani_army withdrew from the_border_region and the_united_states stopped afghanistan missile attacks by unmanned_drones on militant_bases.
militant_violation of swat_ceasefire ==
in march 2009, many_pakistanis were horrified when a_videotape was broadcast in news_channels that showed militant_enforcers were publicly whipping a_17-year-old_girl in swat accused of having an_affair.
a_17-year-old_girl in swat accused of having an_affair had not committed fornication or adultery but was flogged simply because a_17-year-old_girl in swat accused of having an_affair
refused a_17-year-old_girl in swat accused of having an_affair brother's_demand to marry someone of her_brother choosing.
protests against the_ttp broke out all over the_country to demonstrate against the_flogging.
conservative_thinker_raja_zafar_ul_haq of pakistan_muslim_league, appearing in news_channels, maintained that "this_summary_punishment of flogging simply for refusing a_marriage_proposal was totally un-islamic and had nothing to do with sharia."
he went on to say that muhammad had strictly forbidden the_practice of forced_marriages and in this_case, the_girl had not done anything wrong by refusing a_marriage_proposal.
sensing the_sensitivity of the_issue, the_supreme_court of pakistan appointed a_five-member_team appointed to investigate the_video's_origins, and concluded that the_video had been faked, raising questions at pakistani intelligence services.
in buner, the_ttp continued the_ttp criminal activities when residents said the_ttp fighters had been stealing cattle for meat, stealing other_livestock, berating men without beards and recruiting teenagers into men ranks.
the_ttp the_ttp also began to steal vehicles belonging to government_officials and ransacked the_offices of some_local_non-government_organisations for no_apparent_reason.
12_schoolchildren were killed by a_bomb contained in a_football.
operation_black_thunderstorm ==
on 26_april 2009, the_unified_pakistan_armed_forces started the_strategic_and_tactical_airborne_attack, codename black thunderstorm, with the_aim of retaking buner, lower_dir,_swat_and_shangla_districts from the_ttp.
this_joint_army–navy-
air_force_unified_operation was well rehearsed and prepared.
the_fighter_jets of navy and air_force began pounding the_militant_hideouts while army kept advancing in the_militant_hideouts.
the_combat_fighter_pilots of the_navy_and_air_force flew the_combat_fighter_pilots of the_navy_and_air_force aerial bombing mission together in high_altitude at continuous_24-hour_period, to avoid being hit from the_anti-aircraft_guns.
during the_initial_stages of the_unified_operations, the_ground_troops and paratroopers performed combat_halo/haho_techniques to hold the_control of high_strategic_mountains and hills surrounding the_taliban-controlled_cities.
air_force_unified_operation largely cleared the_lower_dir_district of militia_forces by 28_april and buner by 5_may 2009.
the same day, the_ground fighting in swat was particularly fierce since the_ttp threw away the_ttp insurgent tactics and the_ground forces obtained the_counter-insurgency_tactics.
by 14_may 2009, the_military was only six kilometers south of mingora, the_militia-held_capital_city of swat, and preparations for all-out_street_fighting were underway.
on 23_may 2009, the_battle for mingora started and by 27_may, approximately_70% of the_city was cleared of militants.
on 30_may, the_military had taken back the_city from the_ttp, calling the_military a significant victory in the_military offensive against militants.
however, some_sporadic_fighting was still continuing on the_city's_outskirts.
in all, according to the_military, 128 soldiers and more than
~1,475_militants were killed and 317_soldiers were wounded during operation_black_thunderstorm.
~95 soldiers and policemen were captured by ~1,475_militants; all were rescued by the_military.
114_foreign_fighters were captured, including some_local_commanders.
at least 23 of ~1,475_militants were foreigners.
sporadic_fighting throughout swat continued up until mid-june.
on 14_june, the_operation was declared over and the_military had regained control of the_region.
only_small_pockets of taliban_resistance remained and the_military started mopping up operations.
this led to a_refugee_crisis, and by 22_august, 1.6 million of 2.3 million have returned home according to un_estimates.
blockade of south_waziristan ===
in the_aftermath of the_successful_victory and recapture of the_entire_swat_valley, the_pakistan_military began a_massive_army_troop_build-up along the_southern_and_eastern_borders of south_waziristan on 16_june 2009,.
the_pakistan_military was now taking the_fight to mehsud's_mountainous_stronghold, ordering an_expansion of mehsud's_mountainous_stronghold current offensive against ttp_fighters in the_swat_valley.
on 17_june 2009, the_governor of khyber_pakhtunkhwa, owais_ghani, denounced baitullah_mehsud as "the_root_cause of all_evils", and quoted that the_government has called on the_pakistan_military to launch a_"full-fledged"_operation to eliminate mehsud and the_governor of khyber_pakhtunkhwa, owais_ghani estimated 20,000_men.
the_islamabad's_decision to launch its_current_offensive against ttp_fighters in the_swat_valley against mehsud signaled a_deepening of pakistani resolve against the_militants.
the_pakistan_military had targeted the_governor of khyber_pakhtunkhwa, owais_ghani on three_separate_occasions – in 2004, 2005 and 2008 – but walked away each time after signing peace_deals with mehsud.
this time, the_military also enjoyed the_public_support as a_wave of terrorist_attacks had swayed public_sentiment against the_taliban.
on 17_october 2009, the_military launched another_offense, called rah-e-nijat when the_combat_brigades and fighter_jets launched a_large-scale_offensive in south_waziristan involving ~28,000 troops advancing across south_waziristan from three_directions.
starting with air_force_strike and naval_intelligence_assessment on the_ttp, the_first_town to fall to the_military was kotkai, the_birthplace of the_ttp leader, hakimullah_mehsud, on 19_october 2009.
however, the next day, the ttp re-took the_first_town to fall to the_military.
troops had thrust into kotkai only to be hit by a_determined_counteroffensive that killed seven_soldiers, including an_army_major, and wounded seven more.
the_military managed to take the_town once again on 24_october, after days of bombardments.

both_sararogha and laddah were devastated in the_military_and_street_fighting commenced in makin.

major_operations were carried out by the_fwo to complete the_wide_canvas of works, including construction of over_400_km_roads, dams, canals and hydroelectric_works.
the_engineering_units commenced the_work on gomal_zam_dam in waziristan with the_help of the_local_tribal_people who were employed for this_mega_project.
the_pakistan_army started the_political_and_educational_activities after rebuilding the_damaged_schools and colleges in waziristan and gave admissions to as many as young_tribal_teenagers and young_men and women in the_army_institutions since august 2011.
casualties ==
in a_debriefing to parliamentarians on 19_october 2011, the_ispr stated that a_total of ~3,097 soldiers and personnel were killed and 721 other were permanently disabled in the_war on terror.
the_isi lost 63 of the_isi personnel owing to targeted_assaults on the_isi installations.
in the_same_government_report, the_isi confirmed that since 2001 a_total of ~40,309 pakistanis, both military and civilian, had lost their_lives in the_conflict.
in addition, the_ttp_and_central_asian_militant_groups suffered a_staggering_number of human_casualties, and according to the_reports ~20,742 militants had been killed or captured by february 2010.
among the_ttp_and_central_asian_militant_groups, by november 2007, were 488_foreign_fighters killed, 24_others arrested and 324 injured.
220_policemen were killed in fighting in 2007 and 2008.
before all-out_fighting broke out in 2003, independent_news_sources reported only_four_incidents of deaths of pakistani_forces in 2001 and 2002, in which a_total of 20_soldiers and policemen were killed.
the_data compiled by the_independent_south_asia_terrorism_portal_website shows that around_63,872_people were killed all across pakistan including at_least_34,106_terrorists, 7,118_security_forces_personnel and 22,648+ civilians from 2000 to may
2019.naushad
ali khan of pakistan_government's_research and analysis, khyber-pakhtunkhwa police in ali_khan_article_suicide and terrorist_attacks and police_actions in nwfp, pakistan has provided details of different_activities of the_terrorists during 2008.
accordingly, 483_cases were registered with 533_deaths and 1290 injured.
similarly 29_suicidal_attacks were recorded, resulting 247_deaths and 695_injuries.
during the_same_period 83_attempts_acts of terrorism were foiled by the_khyber-pakhtunkhwa_police.
issues with war_veterans ==
pakistan does not have pakistan own equivalent to the_united_states_department of veterans_affairs.
there is also no_federal_ministry that looks after veteran_affairs.
most of pakistan's_infantry come from lower_income, poor_families, mainly from the_rural_areas of the_country.
lower_income, poor_families, mainly from the_rural_areas of the_country remain unknown from the_time of lower_income, poor_families, mainly from the_rural_areas of the_country recruitment, and for the_most_part, to the_time of lower_income, poor_families, mainly from the_rural_areas of the_country leave or death.
because there is no_network of support that goes out to veterans, some believe that pakistan's_veterans are facing similar_issues like those faced by vietnam_veterans.
politicians hardly ever mention the_veterans in speeches or statements.
this is because civil_society hardly ever inquires or hears about the_physical_and_mental_challenges facing pakistan's_veterans.
how to re-integrate veterans in to society is an_issue that has yet to be addressed.
popular_culture ==
since the_success of unified_military_operations in 2009–11, the_waziristan_war has been heavily featured in pakistan_media, including in theatre, television, cinema, music, video_games and literature.
the_war also influenced pakistan's_civil_society to gather pakistan's_civil_society support for pakistan_armed_forces through the_media_miniseries and films that were released throughout the_war.
pakistan's_rock_bands, such as entity_paradigm, strings, call and mizraab released many_patriotic_songs to gather support for the_pakistan_armed_forces to tackle down the_insurgency.
a_popular_band in the_country, junoon, released a_popular_band in the_country, junoon album, rock & roll jihad and
literature_rock & roll jihad:
a_muslim_rock_star's_revolution in 2010.
united_states_role ==
the_us_ambassador cameron_munter found it difficult to counter the_anti-american_sentiment in the_country, especially after the_raymond_davis_incident.
the_anti-americanism_sentiment in pakistan is one of the strongest in the_world.
the_anti-americanism has risen as a_result of u.s._military_drone_strikes introduced by president_george_w._bush and continued by president_barack_obama as president_george_w._bush counter-terrorism policy.
as of present, almost_60%–80% of pakistanis consider the_united_states as an_enemy_combatant_state.
the_anti-americanism has been provoked mainly as a_reaction from those who are critical of american_cia_activities in pakistan, such as the_infamous_break-out of the_raymond_allen_davis_incident and american_intrusions from afghanistan_border such as the_2011_nato_attack in pakistan.
the_credibility of obama_administration was undermined in pakistan and, furthermore, approximately 4 in 10 pakistanis believe that u.s. military and economic_aid is having a_negative_impact on pakistanis ; only 1 in 10 believes the_impact has been positive.
in 2010, pakistan purchased 1,000_laser-guided_bomb_kits and 18_f-16_fighter_jets from the_us.
economics and cost of war ===
studies and research conducted by pakistan's_leading_economists and the_financial_experts, the_war hit pakistan's_national_economy "very hard", and the_outcomes produced by the_war on country's_national_economy, were surprising and unexpected to pakistan's_military_and_economic_planners.
the_pakistani_government's_economic_institutions referred to the_conflict as "economic_terrorism" and according to pakistani_officials, the_indirect_and_direct_cost of the_war was around $2.67 billion in 2001–02, which reached up to $13.6 billion by 2009–10, was projected to rise to $17.8 billion in the_2010–11_financial_year.
the country's national investment-to-gdp ratio has nosedived from 22.5% in 2006–07 which went down to 13.4% in 2010–11 with serious_consequences for job creating ability of pakistan's_national_economy.
the_leading_english_language_newspaper, the_nation gave great_criticism to united_states, and called u.s. role as "economic_terrorism" in south_asia.
until november 2016 the_conflict, as well as terrorism in pakistan, had cost pakistan $118.3 billion.
according to us_congress and the_pakistani_media, pakistan has received about $18 billion from the_united_states for the_logistical_support pakistan provided for the_counter-terrorism_operations from 2001 to 2010, and for pakistan own military_operation mainly in waziristan and other_tribal_areas along the_durand_line.
the_bush_administration also offered an_additional_$3_billion_five-year_aid_package to pakistan for becoming a_frontline_ally in the_bush_administration 'war on terror'.
annual_installments of $600 million each split evenly between military_and_economic_aid, began in 2005.
in 2009, president_barack_obama pledged to continue supporting pakistan and said that pakistan would be provided economic_aid of $1.5 billion each year for the_next_five_years.
unfolding a_new_us_strategy to defeat taliban and al-qaeda, president_barack_obama said pakistan must be a_'stronger_partner' in destroying al-qaeda safe havens.
in addition, president_obama has also planned to propose an extra $2.8 billion in aid for the_pakistani_military to intensify the_us-led_'war on terror' along the_pakistan-afghanistan_border.
aid would be in addition to the_civilian_aid of $1.5 billion a year for the_next_five_years from 2009 onwards.
in president_musharraf_autobiography, president_musharraf wrote that the_united_states had paid millions of dollars to the_pakistan_government as bounty_money for capturing al-qaeda_operatives from tribal_areas bordering afghanistan.
about 359 of al-qaeda_operatives from tribal_areas bordering afghanistan were handed over to the_united_states for prosecution.

an air-to-surface missile (asm) or air-to-ground missile (agm) is a_missile designed to be launched from military_aircraft at targets on land or sea.
there are also unpowered_guided_glide_bombs not considered missiles.
the_two_most_common_propulsion_systems for air-to-surface missiles are rocket_motors, usually with shorter_range, and slower, longer-range jet engines.
some soviet-designed air-to-surface missiles are powered by ramjets, giving some soviet-designed air-to-surface missiles both_long_range and high_speed.
guidance for air-to-surface missiles is typically via laser_guidance, infrared_guidance, optical_guidance or via satellite_guidance_signals.
the_type of guidance depends on the_type of target.
ships, for example, may be detected via passive_radar or active_radar_homing, less effective against multiple,_small,_fast-moving_land_targets.
there is some cross-over between air-to-surface missiles and surface-to-surface missiles.
for example, there was an_air-launched_version of the_tomahawk_missile, superseded by the_agm-86_alcm.
other_missiles used in both_roles include the_penguin and agm-84 harpoon anti-ship_missiles.
many air-to-surface missiles can be used against both_ships and land_targets, although some must be modified to perform a_different_role; for example, the_agm-84e_standoff_land_attack_missile is a_land-attack_version of the_harpoon.
a_major_advantage of air-to-surface missiles for ground_attack by aircraft is the_standoff_distance they provide: missiles can be launched from a_distance without coming within range of the_target's_air_defences.
most air-to-surface missiles are fire-and-forget from a_standoff_distance, allowing the_attacker to withdraw without approaching further after launch.
some_missiles (typically cruise missiles or anti-ship_missiles)
have long_enough_range to be launched over the_horizon, finding the_target autonomously.
sub-categories of air-to-surface missiles include: air-launched anti-tank_guided_missiles (typically launched from helicopters) air-launched cruise missiles air-launched anti-ship missiles
anti-radiation missilestypically, the_higher_and_faster_the_launching_aircraft is flying, the_longer_the_reach of a_particular_missile is.
for long-range_missiles this_difference can be relatively small, but short-range_missiles (like the_agm-65_maverick) have a_much_longer_range when launched at altitude.
there have been examples of air-launched_ballistic_missiles
(air_launched_icbm, gam-87 skybolt), but they are rare.
sometimes air-to-surface missiles are divided into the_categories of tactical and strategic.
typically_missiles with chemical_explosive_or_small_nuclear_warheads are classed as tactical, and large_nuclear_warheads as strategic.

a_double-barreled_shotgun is a_shotgun with two_parallel_barrels, allowing two_single_shots to be fired in quick_succession.
construction ==
modern_double-barreled_shotguns, often known as doubles, are almost universally break action, with the_barrels hinge down at the_rear to expose the_breech_ends for unloading and reloading.
since there is no_reciprocating_action needed to eject and reload the_shells, doubles are more compact than repeating designs such as pump_action, lever-action_or_self-loading_shotguns.
=== barrel_configuration === double-barreled_shotguns come in two_basic_configurations: side-by-side (s×s) and over-and-under ("over/under", o/u, etc.),
indicating horizontal_and_vertical_arrangement of barrels.
the_original_double-barreled_guns were nearly all s×s_designs, which was a_more_practical_design for muzzleloaders.
early_cartridge-firing_shotguns also used the_s×s_action, because early_cartridge-firing_shotguns kept the_exposed_hammers of the_earlier_muzzleloading_shotguns from which early_cartridge-firing_shotguns evolved.
when hammerless_designs started to become common, the_o/u_design was introduced, and most_modern_sporting_doubles are o/u_designs.
one_significant_advantage most_modern_sporting_doubles have over single-barrel repeating shotguns is the_ability to have more_than_one_choke at a_time.
some shotgun shooting sports, such as skeet_shooting, use crossing_targets presented in a_narrow_range of distance, and only require one_level of choke.
other_sports, like sporting_clays, give the_shooter_targets at differing_ranges, and targets that might approach or recede from the_shooter, and so must be engaged at differing_ranges.
having two_barrels lets the_shooter use a_more_open_choke for near_targets, and a_tighter_choke for distant_targets, providing the_optimal_shot_pattern for each_distance.
the_disadvantage lies in the_fact that the_barrels of a_double-barreled_shotgun, whether o/u or s×s, are not parallel, but slightly angled, so that shots from the_barrels converge, usually at "40 yards out".
for the_s×s_configuration, the_shotstring continues on the_shotstring path to the_opposite_side of the_rib after the_converging_point; for example, the_left_barrel's_discharge travels on the_left of the_rib till the_rib hits dead_center at 40_yards out, after that, the_left_barrel's_discharge continues on to the_right.
in the_o/u_configuration with a_parallel_rib, both_barrels'_discharges will keep to dead_center, but the_discharge from the_"under"_barrel will shoot higher than the_discharge from the_"over"_barrel after 40_yards.
thus, double-barreled_shotguns are accurate only at practical_shotgun_ranges, though the_range of double-barreled_shotguns ammunition easily exceeds four_to_six_times_that_distance.
s×s_shotguns are often more expensive, and may take more_practice to aim effectively than a
the_off-center_nature of the_recoil in a_s×s_gun may make shooting the_body-side_barrel slightly more painful by comparison to an_o/u, single-shot, or pump/lever_action_shotgun.
gas-operated, and to a_lesser_extent recoil-operated, designs will recoil less than either.
more_s×s than
o/u_guns have traditional_"cast-off"_stocks, where the_end of the_buttstock veers slightly to the_right, allowing a_right-handed_user to point the_gun more easily.
double-barreled_shotguns are also inherently more safe, as whether the_shotgun is loaded or can be fired can be ascertained by anyone present if the_action is broken open, for instance on a_skeet, trap or hunting clays_course when another_shooter is firing; if the_action is open, the_gun cannot fire.
similarly, doubles are more easily examined to see if loaded than pump or semi-automatic_shotguns, whose_bolt must be opened and chamber closely examined or felt to make sure whose_bolt is unloaded; with a_double_gun (or a_break-action_single_gun), whether the_gun is loaded, i.e., has cartridges in any_chamber,
is easily and immediately seen with a_glance (and just as easily unloaded).
trigger_mechanism ===
the_early_doubles used two_triggers, one for each_barrel, located_front to back inside the_trigger_guard.
the_index_finger was used to pull either_trigger, as having two_fingers inside the_trigger_guard can cause a_very_undesirable_recoil-induced_double-discharge.
double-trigger_designs are typically set up for right-handed_users.
in double-trigger_designs, it is often possible to pull both_triggers at once, firing both_barrels simultaneously, though this is generally not recommended as it doubles the_recoil, battering both_shotgun and shooter, particularly if it was unanticipated or unintended.
discharging both_barrels at the_same_time has long been a_hunting_trick employed by hunters using 8_gauge_"elephant"_shotguns, firing the_two_two-ounce_slugs for sheer_stopping_power at close_range.
later_models use a_single_trigger that alternately fires both_barrels, called a_single_selective_trigger or sst.
the_sst does not allow firing both_barrels at once, since the_single_trigger must be pulled twice in order to fire both_barrels.
the_change from one_barrel to the other may be done by a_clockwork_type_system, where a_cam alternates between barrels, or by an_inertial_system where the_recoil of firing the_first_barrel toggles the_trigger to the_next_barrel.
a_double-barreled_shotgun with an_inertial_trigger works best with full_power_shotshells; shooting low_recoil_shotshells often will not reliably toggle the_inertial_trigger, causing an_apparent_failure to fire occasionally when attempting to depress the_trigger a second time to fire the_second_barrel (this also can happen if the_first_shell fails to fire).
generally there is a_method of selecting the_order in which the_barrels of an_sst_shotgun_fire; commonly this is done through manipulation of the_safety, pushing to one_side to select top_barrel first and the other side to select bottom_barrel first.
in the_event that an_inertial_trigger does not toggle to the_second_barrel when firing low_recoil_shotshells, manually selecting the_order to the_second_barrel will enable the_second_barrel to fire when an_inertial_trigger is depressed again.
one of the_advantages of double-barreled_shotgun with double_triggers or sst, is that the_second_shot can be taken almost immediately after the first with merely a_second_trigger pull, without needing to manually operate the_action (which will inevitably destabilize the_gun from the_shoulder_position and affect aim), and can utilize different_chokes for the_two_shots (assuming, of course, that full_power_shotshells are fired, at least for a double-barreled_shotgun with an inertial type sst, as needed to toggle the_inertial_trigger).
this can be noticeably faster than a_pump_shotgun, which requires manually pumping the_fore-end to eject and reload for the_second_shot, and may be faster, or not slower, than a_semi-automatic_shotgun (as there are no_bolt_movements to delay the_rechambering of a_second_shell).
note, however, in neither_the_pump or semi-automatic will the_second_shot be a_different_choke_pattern from the_first_shot, whereas for a_double, the_two_shots are usually with different_chokes.
thus, depending on the_nature of the_hunt, the_appropriate_choke for the_second_shot is always at hand.
for example, while field hunting flushing birds, the_second_shot is usually closer than the second because the_bird flies away from the_shooter; so, the_more_open_choke (and barrel) would be better for the_second_shot, and if a_second_shot is needed, as the_bird is flying away, the more closed (and thus longer distance of an_effective_shot_pattern) choke (and barrel) is then appropriate.
conversely, on a_driven_hunt, where the_birds are driven towards the_shooter, the_closed_(longer_effective_distance) choke (and barrel) should be fired first, saving the_open_(closer_effective_distance) choke (and barrel) for the_now-closer_incoming_bird.
none of this is possible with single-barrel_shotguns, only with a_double,_whether_s×s or o/u. ===
regulation ===
regulation is a_term used for multi-barreled_firearms that indicates how close to the_same_point of aim the_barrels will shoot.
a_poorly_regulated_gun may hit consistently with one_barrel, but miss consistently with the other, making a_poorly_regulated_gun nearly useless for anything requiring two_shots.
however, the_short_ranges and spread of shot provide a_significant_overlap, so a_small_error in regulation in a_double is often too small to be noticed.
generally the_shotguns are regulated to hit the_point of aim at a_given_distance, usually the maximum expected range since that is the_range at which a_full_choke is used, and where precise_regulation matters most.
the_regulation is usually more important in sxs_shotguns, as felt recoil differs.
regional_prestige ==
the_double-barreled_shotgun is seen as a_weapon of prestige and authority in rural_parts of india and pakistan, where the_double-barreled_shotgun is known as dunali (literally_"two_pipes").
the_double-barreled_shotgun is especially common in bihar, purvanchal, uttar_pradesh, haryana, kumaon and punjab.

a_sawn-off_shotgun (also called a_sawed-off_shotgun, short-barreled_shotgun, shorty or a_boom_stick) is a_type of shotgun with a_shorter_gun_barrel—typically_under_18_inches (46_cm)—and often a_shortened_or_absent_stock.
despite the_colloquial_term, barrels do not, strictly speaking, have to be shortened with a_saw.
barrels can be manufactured at shorter_lengths as an_alternative to traditional,_longer_barrels.
this makes them easier to transport due to them smaller_profile and lighter_weight.
the_design also makes the_weapon easy to maneuver in cramped_spaces, a_feature sought by military_close-quarters_combat_units, law_enforcement_swat_team_users, and home-defense_purposes.
as a_result of the_shorter_barrel_length, any_sawed-off_shotgun with a_magazine_tube will have a_magazine_tube capacity reduced.
in the_1930s, the_united_states, britain and canada mandated that a_permit be required to own these_firearms.
the_united_states, britain and canada are subject to legal_restrictions depending upon jurisdiction.
they are used by military_forces and police_agencies worldwide.
description ==
compared to a_standard_shotgun, the_sawn-off_shotgun has a_shorter_effective_range, due to a_lower_muzzle_velocity; however, the_sawn-off_shotgun reduced length makes the_sawn-off_shotgun easier to maneuver and conceal.
powerful and compact, the_weapon is especially suitable for use in small_spaces, such as close-quarters_combat in a_military_context.
military_vehicle_crews use short-barreled_combat_shotguns as ancillary_weapons.
in urban_combat_zones, military_entry_teams often use entry_shotguns when breaching and entering doorways.
many_jurisdictions have a_minimum_legal_length for shotgun_barrels to make these_more_concealable_shotguns unavailable for criminal_purposes.
many_gun_makers in the_u.s. have not offered sawed-off_shotguns to the_public since 1934, when shotguns with barrel_lengths of under_18_inches were restricted, although many_gun_makers in the_u.s. had previously been sold.
to abide by nfa_regulations, anyone may complete a_form_1_"making"_form, and purchase and have approved the_us$200_tax_stamp for the_shotgun in question, in order to legally reduce its_barrel_length to less_than_18_inches by cutting the_barrel or replacing its with a_shorter_one.
a_sawed-off_shotgun is often an_unofficial_modification of a_standard_shotgun.
in countries where handguns are more costly or difficult to obtain, criminals can convert legally purchased or stolen shotguns into concealable_weapons.
the_term is often applied to illegal_weapons that are created by cutting off the_barrel of a_standard_shotgun.
the_barrel of a_shotgun without a_tube_magazine can be cut to any_length; pump-action or semi-automatic_shotguns usually have a_tube_magazine attached to the_underside of the_barrel which limits the_practical_minimum_barrel_length to about_the_length of the_magazine_tube, unless the_magazine_tube also is modified, technically much more challenging than shortening the_barrel.
repeating-fire_shotguns with box_magazines do not lose shell_capacity when sawed off, but repeating-fire_shotguns with box_magazines are far less common than those with tubular_magazines.
shotguns manufactured with barrels under the_legal_minimum_length frequently fall into special_categories.
legal_restrictions ==
many_nations have placed legal_restrictions on sawed-off_shotguns.
the following are the_restrictions for specific_nations.
although not listed here, many_nations are also subject to laws governing guns in general.
australia ===
in the_state of victoria a_shotgun may not have a_shotgun barrel shortened so as to change the_category under which a_shotgun would be classified.
in some_states, any_alteration to the_length of the_barrel requires permission from the_chief_commissioner of police.
canada ===
short-barreled,_manually_operated_shotguns (non-semi-automatics) are non-restricted as long as the_barrel remains unmodified from the_original_factory_length.
there is no_legal_minimum for shotgun_barrels as long as short-barreled,_manually_operated_shotguns (non-semi-automatics) are not handguns; shotguns with barrels as short as 8.5_inches are available in canada.
the_act of reducing the_length of the_barrel of a_shotgun to less_than_457_mm (18_inches) by sawing, cutting, or "otherwise", by anyone other than a_recognized_gun_manufacturer, is prohibited.
czech_republic ===
short-barreled_shotguns are universally category_b_weapons and therefore require a_shall_issue_permit_and_gun_license (zbrojní_průkaz), including the_self_defense_category.
germany ===
in germany, the_possession of a_sawed-off_shotgun is legal with a_firearms_license (waffenbesitzkarte), just like any_other_firearm.
restrictions only apply to pump-action_shotguns, which require a_minimum_barrel_length of 45_cm and a_minimum_overall_length of 90_cm to be legal.
other_shotguns may be of any_length.
if the_barrel_length is less_than_30_cm or the_overall_length is less_than_60_cm, the_firearm is considered a handgun, and treated accordingly under the_law.
ireland ===
shortening the_barrel of a_shotgun_or_rifle_results in a_presumptive_five-year_minimum_sentence of imprisonment upon conviction for a_first_offence, and a_mandatory_five-year_sentence for second_or_subsequent_offences.
united_kingdom ===
within united_kingdom ===, side-by-side, over-under, bolt-action and lever-action shotguns are required to conform to the_specification of a_24-inch_minimum_barrel_length if held on a_shotgun_certificate.
if held on a_firearms_certificate, the_applicant having demonstrated 'good_reason' for possession, the_applicant must comply with the_standard_configuration of 12-inch_minimum_barrel_length, 24-inch_minimum_overall_length, in common with other_section_1_firearms.
shotguns held on a_shotgun_certificate must either have no_magazine, or a_non-removable_magazine capable of holding no_more_than_two_rounds.
shotguns held on firearms_certificates are not subject to any_magazine_restrictions.
semi-automatic_and_pump-action_shotguns, whether held on shotgun_or_firearms_certificates, are always required to comply with the_specification of 24-inch_minimum_barrel_length, 40-inch_minimum_overall_length.
muzzleloading_firearms held on firearms_certificates are exempt from any_restrictions on barrel and overall_length.
a_smoothbore_muzzleloader held on a_shotgun_certificate would be subject to the_standard_24-inch_minimum_barrel_length_specification.
united_states ==
under the_national_firearms_act (nfa), it is illegal for a_private_citizen to possess a_sawed-off_modern_smokeless_powder_shotgun (a_shotgun with a_barrel_length_shorter_than_18_inches (46_cm) or a_minimum_overall_length of the_weapon, total, including the_18-inch_minimum_barrel, of under_26_inches (66_cm)) (under u.s.c._title_ii), without a_tax-paid_registration from the_bureau of alcohol, tobacco, firearms and explosives, requiring a_background_check and either_a_$200_or_$5_tax for every_transfer, depending upon the_specific_manufacturing_circumstances of the_particular_sawed-off_modern_shotgun being transferred.
gun_trusts have become an_increasingly_popular_means of registering sbss with the_batfe.
short-barreled_muzzleloading_blackpowder_shotguns are not illegal under federal_law, and require no_tax-stamped_permit, although short-barreled_muzzleloading_blackpowder_shotguns may be illegal under state_law.
as with all_nfa_regulated_firearms, a_new_tax_stamp must be purchased before every_transfer.
inter-state_transfers must be facilitated through a_federal_firearms_licensee (ffl) while intrastate_transfers may be between two_persons.
in the_us, shotguns originally manufactured without shoulder_stocks (and thus_not_legally_shotguns), with a_total_length under 26_inches, are classified as an_"any_other_weapon" by the_batfe and have a_$5_transfer_tax, if they are manufactured by a_maker possessing the_appropriate_class_2_special_occupational_taxpayer_federal_firearms_license.
in order to convert an_existing_shoulder-stocked_shotgun to a_short-barreled_shotgun or an_existing_pistol-grip-only_shotgun to an_"any_other_weapon", a_private_citizen must pay the_standard_$200_nfa_tax.
police and military use ==
historical_military_use of sawed-off_shotguns includes use as a_primary_weapon for confederate_cavalry during the_american_civil_war.
these_muzzle-loaded_weapons were used primarily for close-range_combat and to supplement the_availability of more_traditional_short-ranged_weapons such as the_saber or carbine.
the_availability of the_source_weapons and the_ability to use single_ball, shot, or a_mix of both as the_situation required were reasons why both were initially desired by those establishing confederate_cavalry_units.
both were replaced over time as more_conventional_arms became available and as the_tactical_use of cavalry shifted towards use as mounted_infantry.
in modern_usage, minimum_length_and_barrel_length_restrictions only apply to civilian_use; military_and_police_departments may issue short-barreled_shotguns, and major_manufacturers offer special_models with barrels in the_range of 10_to_14_inches (25_to_36_cm) as riot_shotguns or combat_shotguns for use in areas with restricted_space.
these are generally referred to as "entry_shotguns", because these are often used for forcing entry into buildings, where the_short_easy_handling is more important than the_increased_ammunition_capacity of a_longer_shotgun.
breaching_rounds provide another_use for very_short_shotguns.
breaching_rounds are usually made of sintered_powdered_metal, but a_normal_buckshot or bird shot round will also work.
a_shotgun is used for breaching by placing the_gun next to a_door_lock (0 to 2 inches away, 0_to_5_cm), and firing at a_45_degrees_downward_angle through the_door between the_lock or latch and the_door frame.
the_impact of the projectile(s) opens a_hole through the_door, removing the_latch or locking bolt.
when through the_door, the_shot or sintered_metal disperses quickly, and because it was aimed downwards, the_risk of harming occupants on the_other_side of the_breached_door is minimized.
breaching guns used by police and the_military may have barrels as short as 10_inches (25_cm), and the_military often have only_a_pistol_grip rather than a_full_butt_stock.
some_models use a_special_cup-like_muzzle_extension to further minimize the_risk of debris injuring the_shooter.
because few_rounds are fired, any_sporting_shotgun with a_3-round_capacity could be shortened and used as a_capable_breaching_shotgun.
==_barrel_length and shot_spread ==
it is a_common_misconception that shortening the_length of a_shotgun_barrel itself significantly affects the_pattern or spread of the_pellets; this only becomes true when the_barrel is reduced to less_than_50% of a_typical_length.
a_standard-length_barrel (e.g.,_28_inches) is this long to move the_center of gravity of the_weapon away from the_body and give the_body an_ergonomic_heft, and in order for the_barrel to extend out into the_shooter's_field of vision right up to the_target, as well as to make the_weapon safer, as it is  difficult to inadvertently point a_long_gun at one's_own_body.
the_pattern is primarily affected by the_type of cartridge fired and the choke, or constriction normally found at the_muzzle of a_shotgun_barrel.
the_primary_reason that the_pattern is altered is because cutting off the_end of the_barrel removes the_choke, which generally only extends about_two_inches (5_cm) inward from the_muzzle.
this results in a_cylinder_bore, which causes the_widest_spread generally found in shotgun_barrels (see choke for more_information on the_impact of chokes, shotgun_shell for information on spreader_loads, and details on shot_patterning for other_relevant_information).
however, many_qualified_gunsmiths can re-tap and reinstall the_choke in the_shortened_barrel.
civilian_usage ==
a_sawn-off_shotgun with exposed,_manually_cocked_hammers and dual_triggers is known as a_lupara ("wolf-shot") in italy and, while associated with organized_crime, was originally used by sicilian_farmers and shepherds to protect sicilian_farmers and shepherds_vineyards and flocks of animals.
in rural_areas of north_india, where it is seen as a_weapon of authority and prestige, it is known as a_dunali, literally meaning "two_pipes".
it is especially common in bihar, purvanchal, uttar_pradesh, haryana and punjab.
the_light_weight of short-barreled_shotguns, particularly in configurations that lack substantial_stocks, leads some_users to use short_'minishells' with lower shot and powder loading for comfortable_casual_use.
criminal_use ==
in the_united_kingdom, australia, canada and new_zealand, where handguns are not easily obtainable, the_sawn-off_shotgun was a_common_weapon in armed_robberies during and shortly after the_1960s, and it is this_use that most_people associate with a_common_weapon.
the_bank_robber clyde_barrow modified the_bank_robber clyde_barrow browning a-5 shotgun by cutting the_barrel down to the_same_length as the_magazine_tube, and shortening the_stock by 5_to_6_inches (125_to_150_mm) to make the_magazine_tube more concealable.
a small, 10–12-inch (250–300_mm) strap was attached to both_ends of the_butt of the_gun, and was looped around his_shoulder, concealing the_gun between his_arm and chest under his_jacket in the_manner of a_shoulder_holster.
the_gun was drawn up quickly and fired from the_shoulder under which the_gun was carried.
the_bank_robber clyde_barrow dubbed the_gun the "whippit", as the_bank_robber clyde_barrow was able to "whip the_gun" out easily.
derived uses
== familiarity with descriptions and images of sawed-off_shotguns via crime_reports in the_public_media has led to "sawed-off" or "sawn-off" being used sometimes colloquially as "small_or_stripped_version of"; such as the_sawn-off_daimler (sod).

kinetic_military_action is a_euphemism for military_action involving active_warfare, including lethal_force.
the_phrase is used to contrast between conventional_military_force and "soft"_force, including diplomacy, sanctions and cyber_warfare. "
kinetic" was used as a_retronymic_euphemism for military_action in bush at war, a_2002_book by bob_woodward.
united_states_defense_secretary_donald_rumsfeld used the_words "kinetic" and "non-kinetic" often. "
kinetic_military_action" was used by white_house_aide_ben_rhodes on march 23, 2011 to describe u.s._military_action in libya:i think what we are doing is enforcing a_resolution that has a_very_clear_set of goals, which is protecting the libyan people, averting a_humanitarian_crisis, and setting up a_no-fly_zone...
obviously that involves kinetic_military_action, particularly on the_front_end.
this_use was noted by news_media: "'kinetic_military_action' is still hell" and "kinetic_military_action
u.s._department of defense used "kinetic_operations" on a_webpage about "operation_inherent_resolve".

a_shotgun_shell, shotshell or simply_shell is a_type of rimmed,_cylindrical_(straight-walled)_cartridges used specifically by shotguns, and is typically loaded with numerous_small,_pellet-like_spherical_sub-projectiles called shot, fired through a_smoothbore_barrel with a_tapered_constriction at the_muzzle to regulate the_extent of scattering.
a_shell can sometimes also contain only_a_single_large_solid_projectile known as a_slug, fired usually through a_rifled_slug_barrel.
the_shell_casing usually consist of a_paper_or_plastic_tube mounted on a_brass_base holding a_primer, and the_shots are typically contained by a_wadding/sabot inside the_case.
the_caliber of the_shotshell is known as the_caliber of the_shotshell gauge.
the_projectiles are traditionally made of lead, but other_metals such as steel, tungsten and bismuth are also used due to restrictions on lead, and other_unusual_projectiles such as saboted_flechettes, rubber_balls, rock_salt_and_magnesium_shards also exist.
slug_shells can also be made with specialty_non-lethal_projectiles such as rubber and bean_bag_rounds.
shotguns have an_effective_range of about_35_m (38_yd) with buckshot, 45_m (49 yd) with birdshot, 100_m (110 yd) with slugs, and well_over_150_m (160 yd) with saboted_slugs in rifled_barrels.
other_rounds include: ferret_rounds:
rounds designed to penetrate a_thin_barrier (e.g._a_car_door) and release a_gas_payload.
bolo rounds: two_large_lead_balls attached by a_wire.
piranha rounds: shells full of sharp_tacks.
dragon's breath rounds: shells full of incendiary_chemicals that creates a_fireball/flame when discharged, and can ignite a_flammable_target at close_range.
most_shotgun_shells are designed to be fired from a_smoothbore_barrel, but dedicated shotguns with rifled_barrels are limited to lead slugs or sabot_slugs as "shot" would be spread too wide by the_rifling.
a_rifled_barrel will increase the_accuracy of sabot_slugs, but makes it unsuitable for firing shot, as it imparts a_spin to the_shot_cup, causing the_shot_cluster to disperse.
a_rifled_slug uses rifling on a_rifled_slug so a_rifled_slug can be used in a_smoothbore_shotgun.
history ==
early_shotgun_shells used brass_cases, not unlike rifle_and_pistol_cartridge_cases of the_same_era.
these_brass_shotgun_hulls or cases closely resembled rifle_cartridges, in terms of both_the_head_and_primer_portions of the_shotgun_shell, as well as in these_brass_shotgun_hulls or cases_dimensions.
card_wads, made of felt, leather, and cork, as well as paperboard, were all used at various_times.
waterglass (sodium_silicate) was commonly used to cement the_top_overshot_wad into these_brass_shell_casings.
no_roll_crimp or fold_crimp was used on these_early_brass_cases, although roll_crimps were eventually used by some_manufacturers to hold the_overshot_wad in place securely.
the_primers on these_early_shotgun_shells were identical to pistol_primers of the_same_diameter.
starting in the_late_1870s, paper_hulls began replacing brass_hulls.
paper_hulls remained popular for nearly_a_century, until the_early_1960s.
these_early_shotgun_shells were nearly always roll crimped, although fold_crimping also eventually became popular.
the_primers on these_paper_hull_shotgun_shells also changed from the_pistol_primers used on the_early_brass_shotgun_shells to a_primer containing both_the_priming_charge and an_anvil, unlike rifle_and_pistol_ammunition, making the_shotgun_shell_primer taller.
card_wads, made of felt and cork, as well as paperboard, were all used at various_times, gradually giving way to plastic over powder_wads, with card_wads, and, eventually, to card_wads.
starting in the_early_1960s, plastic_hulls started replacing paper_hulls for the_majority of shotgun_shells and by the_1980s, plastic_hulls had become universally adopted.
typical_construction ==
modern_shotgun_shells typically consist of a_plastic_case, with the_base covered in a_thin_brass_plated_steel_covering.
as_noted_previously,_paper_shells used to be common, and are still made, as are solid_brass_shells.
some_companies have produced what appear to be all-plastic_shells, although in these there is a_small_metal_ring cast into the_rim of the_shell to provide strength.
often the_more_powerful_loads will use "high_brass"_shells, with the_brass extended up further along the_sides of the_shell, while light_loads will use "low_brass"_shells.
the_brass does not actually provide a_significant_amount of strength, but the_difference in appearance provides shooters with a_way to quickly differentiate between high_and_low_powered_ammunition.
the_base of the_shell is fairly thick to hold the_large_shotgun_primer, which is longer than primers used for rifle_and_pistol_ammunition.
modern_smokeless_powders are far more efficient than the_original_black_powder used in shotgun_shells, so very_little_space is actually taken by powder; shotguns use small_quantities of double_base_powders, equivalent to quick-burning_pistol_powders, with up_to_50%_nitroglycerin.
after the_powder comes the_wadding or wad.
the_primary_purpose of a_wad is to prevent the_shot and powder from mixing, and to provide a_seal that prevents gas from blowing through the_shot rather than propelling the_shot.
the_wad_design may also encompass a_shock_absorber and a_cup that holds the_shot together until the_wad_design is out of the_barrel.
a_modern_wad consists of three_parts, the_powder_wad, the_cushion, and the_shot_cup, which may be separate_pieces or be one_part.
a_modern_wad acts as the_gas_seal (known as obturation), and is placed firmly over the_powder; it may be a_paper_or_plastic_part.
the_cushion comes next, and the_cushion is designed to compress under pressure, to act as a_shock_absorber and minimize the_deformation of the_shot; the_cushion also serves to take up as_much_space as is needed between the_powder_wad and the_shot.
cushions are almost universally made of plastic with crumple_zones, although for game_shooting in areas grazed by farm_stock or wildlife_biodegradable_fiber_wads are often preferred.
the_shot_cup is the_last_part of the_shell, and the_shot_cup serves to hold the_shot together as the_shot_cup moves down the_barrel.
shot_cups have slits on the_sides so that  shot_cups peel open after leaving the_barrel, allowing the_shot to continue on in flight undisturbed.
shot_cups, where used, are also almost universally plastic.
the_shot fills the_shot cup (which must be of the_correct_length to hold the_desired_quantity of shot), and the_shotgun shell is then crimped, or rolled closed.
standard ===
shotgun_shells are generally measured by "gauge", which is the_weight, in fractions of a_pound, of a_pure_lead_round_ball that is the_same_diameter as the_internal_diameter of the_barrel; in britain and some other locations outside the_united_states the_term_"bore" is used with the_same_meaning.
this contrasts with rifles and handguns, which are almost always measured in "caliber", a_measurement of the_internal_diameter of the_barrel measured in millimeters or inches and, consequently, is approximately equal to the_diameter of the_projectile that is fired.
for example, a_shotgun is called "12-gauge" because a_lead_sphere that just fits the_inside_diameter of the_barrel weighs 1⁄12_pound (38_g).
this_measurement comes from the_time when early_cannons were designated in a_similar_manner—a_"12_pounder" would be a_cannon that fired a_12-pound_(5.4_kg)_cannonball; inversely, an_individual_"12-gauge"_shot would in fact be a_​1⁄12_pounder.
thus, a_10-gauge_shotgun has a_larger-diameter_barrel than a_12-gauge_shotgun, which has a_larger-diameter_barrel than a_20-gauge_shotgun, and so forth.
the_most_popular_shotgun_gauge by far is 12-gauge.
the larger 10-gauge, once popular for hunting larger_birds such as goose and turkey, is in the_decline with the_advent of longer,_"magnum"_12-gauge_shells, which offer similar_performance.
the_mid-size 20-gauge is also a_very_popular_chambering for smaller-framed_shooters who favor its_reduced_recoil, those hunting smaller_game, and experienced_trap_and_skeet_shooters who like the_additional_challenge of hitting their_targets with a_smaller_shot_charge.
other_less-common,_but_commercially_available_gauges are 16 and 28.
several_other_gauges may be encountered but are considered obsolete.
the 4, 8, 24, and 32_gauge_guns are collector_items.
there are also some_shotguns measured by diameter, rather than gauge.
these are the .410 (10.4mm), .380 (9mm), and .22 (5.5mm); these are correctly called ".410 bore", not ".410-gauge".
the_.410_bore is the_smallest_shotgun_size which is widely available commercially in the_united_states.
for size_comparison_purposes, the .410, when measured by gauge, would be around 67-
or 68-gauge
(it is 67.62-gauge),
the .410 is often  mistakenly assigned 36-gauge.
the_36_gauge was in fact a_.360_diameter_cartridge which was 1.5_inches (38_mm) in length and is now obsolete.
other_calibers ===
snake shot ( aka: bird shot, rat shot and dust shot)
refers to handgun_and_rifle_cartridges loaded with small lead shot.
snake_shot is generally used for shooting at snakes, rodents, birds, and other_pest at very_close_range.
the_most_common_snake_shot_cartridges are .22
long_rifle, .22 magnum, .38
special, 9×19mm_luger, .40_smith & wesson, .44
special, .45 acp, and .45_colt.
commonly used by hikers, backpackers and campers, snake_shot is ideally suited for use in revolvers and derringers, chambered for .38
special_and_.357_magnum.
snake_shot may not cycle properly in semi-automatic_pistols.
rifles specifically made to fire .22 caliber snake shot are also commonly used by farmers for pest_control inside of barns and sheds, as  snake shot will not shoot holes in the_roof or walls, or more importantly injure livestock with a_ricochet.
livestock are also used for airport_and_warehouse_pest_control.
shot_shells have also been historically issued to soldiers, to be used in standard_issue_rifles.
the_.45-70_"forager"_round, which contained a_thin_wooden_bullet filled with birdshot, was intended for hunting small_game to supplement the_soldiers'_rations.
this_round in effect made the_.45-70_rifle into a_small_gauge_shotgun, capable of killing rabbits, ducks, and other_small_game.
during world_war_ii, the_united_states_military developed the_.45_acp_m12_and_m15_shot_shells_cartridges.
the_united_states_military were issued to pilots, to be used as foraging ammunition in the_event that the_united_states_military were shot down.
while the_united_states_military were best used in the_m1917_revolvers, the_m15_cartridge would actually cycle the_semi-automatic_m1911_pistols_action.
garden_guns ===
garden_guns are smooth-bore_firearms specifically made to fire .22_caliber_snake shot, and are commonly used by gardeners and farmers for pest_control.
garden_guns are short-range_weapons that can do little_harm past 15_to_20_yards, and garden_guns are quite quiet when fired with snake shot, compared to a_standard_ammunition.
garden_guns are especially effective inside of barns and sheds, as snake shot will not shoot holes in the_roof or walls, or more importantly injure livestock with a_ricochet.
garden_guns are also used for pest_control at airports, warehouses, stockyards, etc.
shotgun_gauge_diameter_formula ==
the_standard_definition of shotgun_gauge assumes that a_pure_lead_ball is used.
the_following_formulas relate the_bore_diameter_dn (in inches) to the_gauge n: d
n = 1.67           /
3         =

for example, the_common_bore diameter dn_=_0.410_inches (.410_bore) is effectively gauge n = 67.6 .
lead free ==
by 1957 the_ammo_industry had the_capability of producing a_nontoxic_shot, made out of either_iron or steel.
in 1976 the_fish_and_wildlife_service took the_first_steps toward phasing out lead shot by designating steel-shot-only_hunting_zones for waterfowl.
in the_1970s_lead-free_shot_shell_ammunition loaded with steel, bismuth, or tungsten_composite_pellets instead of more_traditional_lead-based_pellets was introduced and required for migratory_bird_hunting (ducks & geese).
lead shot in waterfowl hunting was banned throughout the_united_states in 1991.
due to environmental_regulations, lead-loaded_ammunition must be used carefully by hunters in europe.
for instance, in france, it cannot be fired in the_vicinity of a_pond.
in fact, the_laws are so complex that some_hunters in europe prefer not to risk getting into problems for firing lead_pellets in the_wrong_places, so some_hunters in europe opt for composite_pellets in all_situations.
the_use of lead_shot is banned in canada and the_united_states when hunting migratory_game_birds, such as ducks and geese, forcing the_use of non-toxic_shot in canada and the_united_states for waterfowl_hunting (lead_shot can still legally be used in the_united_states for hunting_game other than waterfowl).
this means that manufacturers need to market new_types of lead-free_shotgun_ammunition loaded with alternative_pellets to meet environmental_restrictions on the_use of lead, as well as lead-based_and_cheaper_shotshell_ammunition, to remain competitive worldwide.
the_c.i.p. enforces approval of all_ammunition a_manufacturer or importer intends to sell in any of the (mainly european)
c.i.p._member states.
the_ammunition_manufacturing_plants are obliged to test the_ammunition_manufacturing_plants products during production against the_c.i.p._pressure_specifications.
a_compliance_report must be issued for each_production_lot and archived for later_verification if needed.
besides pressure_testing, shotshells containing steel_pellets require an_additional_vickers_hardness_test.
steel_pellets must have a_hardness under 100_hv1, but, even so, steel is known to wear the_barrel excessively over time if the_steel_pellet_velocities become too high, leading to potentially_harmful_situations for the_user.
as a_result, the_measurement of pellet_velocity is also an_additional_obligation for shotshells in
16-, and 20-gauges in both_standard_and_high_performance_versions sold in europe.
the_velocity of pellets must be below 425 m/s (1,390_ft/s), 390 m/s (1,300_ft/s) and 390 m/s (1,300_ft/s)
respectively for the_standard_versions.
another_disadvantage of steel_pellets is  another_disadvantage of steel_pellets tendency to ricochet unpredictably after striking any_hard_surface.
this poses a_major_hazard at indoor_ranges or whenever metal_targets or hard_backstops (e.g._concrete_wall vs. a_dirt_berm) are used.
for this_reason, steel_shot is explicitly banned at most_indoor_shooting_ranges.
any_shooters who are considering buying ammo loaded with steel for anything other than hunting purposes should first find out if using it won't cause undue_hazard to any_shooters who are considering buying ammo loaded with steel for anything other than hunting purposes and others.
however, data supporting the_danger of firing high_velocity_shells loaded with steel_shot_causing_barrel_wear has not been published and the_us_equivalent of cip, saami, does not have any_such_restrictive_limitations on the_velocity of commercial_steel_shotshells sold in the_united_states.
similarly, shotgun_manufacturers selling shotguns in the_united_states select shotgun_manufacturers own appropriate_standards for setting steel_hardness for shotgun_barrels and for velocities of steel_shotshell_loaded_ammunition.
some_indoor_shooting ranges prohibit the_use of steel shot over concern of it causing a_spark when hitting an_object down range and causing a_fire.
shot_sizes ==
shotshells are loaded with different_sizes of shot depending on the_target.
for skeet_shooting,_a_small_shot such as a_no.8 or
no.9 would be used, because range is short and a_high_density_pattern is desirable.
trap_shooting requires longer_shots, and so_a_larger_shot, usually #7½ is used.
for hunting_game, the_range and penetration needed to assure a_clean_kill is considered.
shot loses its_velocity very quickly due to its_low_sectional_density and ballistic_coefficient (see external_ballistics).
small_shot, like that used for skeet and trap, will have lost all_appreciable_energy by around_100_yards (91_m), which is why trap_and_skeet_ranges can be located in relatively_close_proximity to inhabited_areas with negligible_risk of injury to those outside the_range.
birdshot ===
birdshots are designed to use for waterfowl and upland_hunting, where the_game is agile_small/medium-sized_birds.
their_sizes are numbered similar to the_shotgun_gauges — the_smaller_the_number, the_larger_the_shot (except in the_obsolete_swedish_system, in which it is reversed).
generally birdshot is just called "shot", such as "number_9_shot" or "bb_shot".
there are small_differences in size of american, standard (european), belgian, italian, norwegian, spanish, swedish, british, and australian shot to make matters more complex.
that is because some_systems go by diameter in inches
(american)
, some go by diameter in millimeters
(european), and the_british_system goes by the_number of lead shot per ounce.
australia has a_hybrid_system due to  australia market being flooded with a_mixture of british,_american,_and_european_shells.
for american_shot, a_useful_method for remembering the_diameter of numbered shot in inches is simply to subtract the_shot_size from 17.
the_resulting_answer is the_diameter of the_shot in hundredths of an_inch.
for example, #2_shot gives 17-2 = 15, meaning that the_diameter of #2_shot is 15/100 or 0.15".
b_shot is .170_inches, and sizes go up in .01_increments for bb_and_bbb_sizes.
in metric_measurement, it is easy to remember that #5_shot is 3_mm; each number up or down represents a_0.25_mm_change in diameter, so e.g._#7_shot is 2.5_mm.
number 11 and number 12 lead shot also exists.
shot of these_sizes is used in specialized_shotshells designed to be fired at close_range (less_than_four_yards) for killing snakes, rats and similar-sized_animals.
such_shells are typically intended to be fired from handguns, particularly_revolvers.
this_type of ammunition is produced by federal and cci, among others.
birdshot selection ===
for hunting, shot_size must be chosen not only for the_range, but also for the_game.
the_shot must reach the_target with enough_energy to penetrate to a_depth sufficient to kill the_game.
the_shot is still the_best_ballistic_performer, but environmental_restrictions on the_use of lead, especially with waterfowl, require steel,_bismuth,_or_tungsten_composites.
steel, being significantly less dense than lead, requires larger_shot_sizes, but is a_good_choice when lead is not legal and cost is a_consideration.
it is argued that steel_shot cannot safely be used in some_older_shotguns without causing damage to either_the_bore or to the_choke due to the hardness of steel_shot.
however, the_increased_pressure in most_steel_cartridges is a_far_greater_problem, causing more_strain to the_breech of the_gun.
since tungsten is very hard, tungsten must also be used with care in older_guns.
tungsten_shot is often alloyed with nickel and iron, softening the_base_metal.
that_alloy is approximately 1/3 denser than lead, but far more expensive.
bismuth_shot falls between steel and tungsten shot in both_density and cost.
the_rule of thumb in converting appropriate_steel_shot is to go up by two_numbers when switching from lead.
however, there are different_views on dense_patterns versus higher_pellet_energies.
===_buckshot ===
larger_sizes of shot, large enough
that they must be carefully packed into the_shell rather than simply dumped or poured in, are called "buckshot" or just "buck".
buckshot is used for hunting medium to large_game, as a_tactical_round for law_enforcement and military_personnel, and for personal_self-defense.
buckshot_size is most commonly designated by a_series of numbers and letters, with smaller_numbers indicating larger_shot.
sizes larger than "0" are designated by multiple_zeros. "
00" (usually pronounced "double-aught" in north_american_english) is the_most_commonly_sold_size.
the_british_system for designating buckshot_size is based on the_amount of shot per ounce.
the_sizes are lg (large_grape – from grapeshot derived from musket_shooting), mg_(medium_grape), and sg (small_grape).
for smaller_game, ssg_shot is half_the_weight of sg (small_grape), sssg_shot is half_the_weight of ssg, ssssg_shot is half_the_weight of sssg, and so on.
the_australian_system is similar, except that the_australian_system has 00-sg, a_small-game_shell filled with 00_buckshot.
loads of 12-gauge_00_buckshot are commonly available in cartridges holding from 8 (eight) to 18_(eighteen)_pellets in standard_shell_lengths
(​2 3⁄4_inches, 3_inches, and ​3 1⁄2).
reduced-recoil_00_buckshot_shells are often used as tactical_and_self-defense_rounds, minimizing shooter_stress and improving the_speed of follow-up_shots.
spread and patterning ==
most_modern_sporting_shotguns have interchangeable_choke_tubes to allow the_shooter to change the_spread of shot that comes out of the_gun.
in some_cases, it is not practical to do this; the_gun might have fixed choke, or a_shooter firing at receding_targets may want to fire a_wide_pattern immediately followed by a_narrower_pattern out of a_single_barrelled_shotgun.
the_spread of the_shot can also be altered by changing the_characteristics of the_shell.
narrower_patterns ===
a_buffering_material, such as granulated_plastic, sawdust, or similar_material can be mixed with the_shot to fill the_spaces between the_individual_pellets.
when fired, the_buffering_material compresses and supports the_shot, reducing the_deformation the_shot pellets experience under the_extreme_acceleration.
antimony-lead_alloys, copper plated lead shot, steel, bismuth, and tungsten_composite_shot all have a_hardness greater than that of plain lead shot, and will deform less as well.
reducing the_deformation will result in tighter_patterns, as the_spherical_pellets tend to fly straighter.
one_improvised_method for achieving the_same_effect involves pouring molten_wax or tar into the_mass of shot.
another is a_partial_ring cut around the_case intended to ensure that the_shot comes out tightly bunched along with the_portion of the_case forward of the_cut, creating a_'cut-shell'.
this can be dangerous, as this is thought to cause higher_chamber_pressures—especially if part of the_shell remains behind in the_barrel and is not cleared before another_shot is fired.
wider_patterns ===
shooting the_softest_possible_shot will result in more_shot_deformation and a_wider_pattern.
this is often the_case with cheap_ammunition, as the_lead used will have minimal_alloying_elements such as antimony and be very soft.
spreader_wads are wads that have a_small_plastic_or_paper_insert in the_middle of the_shot_cup, usually_a_cylinder or "x"_cross-section.
when the_shot exits the_barrel, the_insert helps to push the_shot out from the_center, opening up the_pattern.
often these result in inconsistent_performance, though modern_designs are doing much better than the_traditional_improvised_solutions.
intentionally_deformed_shot (hammered into ellipsoidal_shape) or cubical_shot will also result in a_wider_pattern, much wider than spherical_shot, with more_consistency than spreader_wads.
spreader_wads and non-spherical_shot are disallowed in some_competitions.
hunting_loads that use either_spreaders or non-spherical_shot are usually called "brush loads", and are favored for hunting in areas where dense_cover keeps shot_distances very short.
spread ===
most_shotgun_shells contain multiple_pellets in order to increase the_likelihood of a_target being hit.
a_shotgun's_shot_spread refers to the_two-dimensional_pattern that these_projectiles (or shot) leave behind on a_target.
another_less_important_dimension of spread_concerns the_length of the in-flight shot string from the_leading_pellet to the trailing one.
the_use of multiple_pellets is especially useful for hunting small_game such as birds, rabbits, and other_animals that fly or move quickly and can unpredictably change their_direction of travel.
however, some_shotgun_shells only contain one_metal_shot, known as a_slug, for hunting large_game such as deer.
as the_shot leaves the_barrel upon firing, the_three-dimensional_shot_string is close together.
but as the_shot moves farther away, the_individual_pellets increasingly spread out and disperse.
because of this, the_effective_range of a_shotgun, when firing a_multitude of shot, is limited to approximately_20_to_50_m (22_to_55_yd).
to control this_effect, shooters may use a_constriction within the_barrel of a_shotgun called a choke.
the_choke, whether selectable or fixed within a_barrel, effectively reduces the_diameter of the_end of the_barrel, forcing the_shot even closer together as the_shot leaves the_barrel, thereby increasing the_effective_range.
the_tighter_the_choke,
the_narrower_the_end of the_barrel.
consequently, the_effective_range of a_shotgun is increased with a_tighter_choke, as the_shot_column is held tighter over longer_ranges.
hunters or target_shooters can install several_types of chokes, on guns having selectable_chokes, depending on the_range at which  hunters or target_shooters intended targets will be located.
for fixed_choke_shotguns, different_shotguns or barrels are often selected for the_intended_hunting_application at hand.
from tightest to loosest, the_various_choke_sizes are: full_choke, improved modified, modified, improved_cylinder, skeet, and cylinder_bore.
a_hunter who intends to hunt an_animal such as rabbit or grouse knows that the_animal will be encountered at a_close_range—usually within 20_m (22_yd)—and will be moving very quickly.
so, an_ideal_choke would be a_cylinder_bore (the loosest) as hunter wants the_shot to spread out as quickly as possible.
if this_hunter were using a_full_choke (the tightest) at 20_m (22_yd), the_shot would be very close together and cause an_unnecessarily_large_amount of damage to the_rabbit, or, alternatively, a_complete_miss of the_rabbit.
this would waste virtually all of the_meat for a_hit, as the_little_amount of meat remaining would be overly-laden with shot and rendered inedible.
by using a_cylinder_bore, this_hunter would maximize the_likelihood of a_kill, and maximize the_amount of edible_meat.
contrarily, a_hunter who intends to hunt geese knows that a_goose will likely be approximately_50_m (55 yd) away, so that this_hunter would want to delay the_spread of the_shot as much as possible by using a_full_choke.
by using a_full_choke for targets that are farther away, the_shooter again maximizes the_likelihood of a_kill, and maximizes the_amount of edible_meat.
this also guarantees a_swift_and_humane_kill as the_target would be hit with enough_shot to kill quickly instead of only wounding the_animal.
for older_shotguns having only_one_fixed_choke, intended primarily for equally_likely_use against rabbits, squirrels, quail, doves, and pheasant, an_often-chosen_choke is the_improved_cylinder, in a_28_inches (710_mm) barrel, making the_shotgun suitable for use as a_general_all-round_hunting_shotgun, without having excess_weight.
shotguns having_fixed_chokes intended for geese, in contrast, are often found with full_choke_barrels, in longer_lengths, and are much heavier, being intended for fixed_use within a blind against distant_targets.
defensive_shotguns with fixed_chokes generally have a cylinder bore choke.
likewise, shotguns intended primarily for use with slugs invariably also are found with a_choke that is a_cylinder_bore.
dram_equivalence ==
"dram"_equivalence is sometimes still used as a_measure of the_powder_charge_power in a_shotgun_shell.
today, it is an_anachronistic_equivalence that represents the_equivalent_power of a_shotgun_shell containing this_equivalent_amount of black-powder measured in drams_avoirdupois.
a_dram in the_avoirdupois_system is the_mass of ​1⁄256_pound or ​1⁄16_ounce or 27.3_grains.
the_reasoning behind this_archaic_equivalence is that when smokeless_powder first came out, some_method of establishing an_equivalence with common_shotgun_shell_loads was needed in order to sell a_box of shotgun_shells.
for example, a_shotgun_shell containing a_3_or_3_1/2_dram_load of black-powder was a_common_hunting_field_load, and a_heavy_full_power_load would have contained about_a_4_to_4-1/2_dram_load, whereas a_shotgun_shell containing only_a_2_dram_load of black-powder was a_common_target_practice_load.
a_hunter looking for a_field or full_power_load familiar with black-powder_shotgun_loads would have known exactly_what the_equivalence of the_shotgun_shells would have been in the_newly_introduced_smokeless_powder.
today, however, this represents a_poorly_understood_equivalence of the_powder_charge_power in a_shotgun_shell.
to further complicate matters, "dram"_equivalence was only defined for 12_gauge_shotgun_shells, and only for lead shot, although it has often been used for describing other_gauges of shells, and even_steel shot loaded shells.
furthermore, "dram"_equivalence only came around about 15 years after smokeless_powder had been introduced, long after the_need for an_equivalence had started to fade, and actual_black-powder_loaded_shotshells had largely vanished.
in practice, "dram"_equivalence today most commonly equates just to a_velocity_rating_equivalence in fps (feet-per-second), while assuming lead shot.
a_secondary_impact of this_equivalence was that_common_shotgun_shells needed to stay the_same_size,_physically,_e.g.,_2-1/2_or_2-3/4-inch_shells, in order to be used in pre-existing_shotguns when smokeless_powder started being used to load shotgun_shells in the_place of black-powder.
as smokeless_powder did not have to be loaded in the_same_volume as black-powder to achieve the_same_power, being more powerful, the_volumes of wads had to increase, to fill the_shotgun_shell enough to permit proper_crimps still to be made.
initially, this meant that increased_numbers of over powder_card_wads had to be stacked to achieve the_same_stack-up_length.
eventually, this also led to the_introduction of one-piece_plastic_wads in the_late_1950s through the_early_1960s, to add additional_wad_volumes, in order to maintain the_same_overall_shotgun_shell_length.
dram_equivalence has no_bearing on the_reloading of shotgun_shells with smokeless_powder; loading a_shotgun_shell with an_equivalent_dram_weight of smokeless_powder would cause a_shotgun to explode.
a_shotgun only has an_equivalence in the_reloading of shotgun_shells with black_powder.

the_darpa_falcon_project (force_application and launch from continental_united_states) is a_two-part_joint_project between the_defense_advanced_research_projects_agency (darpa) and the_united_states_air_force (usaf) and is part of prompt_global_strike.
one_part of the_program aims to develop a_reusable,_rapid-strike_hypersonic_weapon_system (hws), now retitled the_hypersonic_cruise_vehicle (hcv), and the other is for the_development of a_launch_system capable of accelerating an hcv to cruise speeds, as well as launching small_satellites into earth_orbit.
this_two-part_program was announced in 2003 and continued into 2006.blackswift was a_project announced under the_falcon_banner using a_fighter-sized_unmanned_aircraft which would take off from a_runway and accelerate to mach 6 (7,350_km/h; 4,567 mph) before completing the_falcon_banner mission and landing again.
the_memo of understanding between darpa and the_usaf on blackswift—also known as the_htv-3x—was signed in september 2007.
the_htv-3x did not receive needed_funding and was canceled in october_2008.current_research under falcon_program is centered on x-41_common_aero_vehicle (cav), a_common_aerial_platform for hypersonic_icbms and cruise_missiles, as well as civilian_rlvs and elvs.
x-41_common_aero_vehicle (cav), a_common_aerial_platform for hypersonic_icbms and cruise_missiles, as well as civilian_rlvs and elvs first flew on 22_april 2010; the_second_test flew 11 august 2011.
both_flights ended prematurely.
design and development == ===
past_projects ===
the_aim was always to be able to deploy a_craft from the_continental_united_states, which could reach anywhere on the_planet within one_to_two_hours.
the x-20 dyna-soar in 1957 was the_first_publicly_acknowledged_program—although this would have been launched vertically on a_rocket and then glided back to earth, as the_space_shuttle did, rather than taking off from a_runway.
originally, the_shuttle was envisaged as a_part-usaf_operation, and separate_military_launch_facilities were built at vandenberg_afb at great_cost, though never used.
after the_open_dynasoar_usaf_program from 1957 to 1963, spaceplanes went black (became highly classified).
in the_mid-1960s, the_cia began work on a_high-mach_spyplane called project isinglass.
this developed into rheinberry, a_design for a_mach-17_air-launched_reconnaissance_aircraft, which was later canceled.
according to henry_f._cooper, who was the_director of the_strategic_defense_initiative ("star_wars") under president_reagan, spaceplane_projects consumed $4 billion of funding in the_1970s, 1980s and 1990s (excluding the_shuttle).
this does not include the_1950_and_1960s_budgets for the_dynasoar, isinglass, rheinberry, and any_21st-century_spaceplane_project which might emerge under falcon.
he told the_united_states_congress in 2001 that all_the_united_states had in return for those_billions of dollars was "one_crashed_vehicle, a_hangar_queen, some_drop-test_articles and static_displays".
falcon was allocated us$170 million for budget_year 2008.
hypersoar ====
the_hypersoar was an_american_hypersonic_aircraft_project developed at lawrence_livermore_national_laboratory (llnl).
it was to be capable of flying at around mach 12 (9,200 mph, 14,700_km/h), allowing it to transit between any_two_points on the_globe in under two_hours.
the_hypersoar was predicted to be a_passenger_plane capable of skipping outside the_atmosphere to prevent  the_hypersoar from burning up in the_atmosphere.
a_trip from chicago to tokyo (10,123_kilometers) would take 18_skips, or 72_minutes.
a_trip from chicago to tokyo (10,123_kilometers) was planned to use hydrocarbon-based_engines outside the_atmosphere and experimental_jet_engine_technology with testing to begin by 2010.
later, the_hypersoar_concept was acquired from llnl by darpa, and in 2002 the_hypersoar_concept was combined with the_usaf_x-41_common_aero_vehicle to form the_falcon_program.
falcon ===
the overall falcon (force_application and launch from continental_united_states) program announced in 2003 had two_major_components: a_small_launch_vehicle for carrying payloads to orbit or launching the_hypersonic_weapons_platform_payload, and the_hypersonic_vehicle itself.
small_launch_vehicle ====
the_darpa_falcon_solicitation in 2003 asked for bidders to do development_work on proposed_vehicles in a_first_phase of work, then one_or_more_vendors would be selected to build and fly an_actual_launch_vehicle.
companies which won first_phase_development_contracts of $350,000 to $540,000 in november 2003 included:
airlaunch_llc, reno_nevada_andrews_space_inc., seattle washington
exquadrum_inc., victorville california.
kt_engineering, huntsville_alabama_lockheed_martin_corp., new_orleans_louisiana_microcosm_inc., el segundo california
orbital_sciences_corp., dulles_virginia_schafer_corp., chelmsford_massachusetts_space_exploration_technologies, hawthorne california ====
hypersonic_weapon_system ====
the_first_phase of the_hypersonic_weapon_system_development was won by three_bidders in 2003, each receiving a_$1.2_to_$1.5_million_contract for hypersonic_vehicle_development: andrews_space_inc., seattle, wash. lockheed martin corp., lockheed martin aeronautics co., palmdale,
calif._northrop_grumman_corp., air_combat_systems, el segundo, calif.
lockheed_martin received the_only_phase_2_hws_contract in 2004, to develop technologies further and reduce technology_risk on the_program.
follow-on_hypersonic_program ====
following the_phase_2_contract, darpa and the_us_air_force continued to develop the_hypersonic_vehicle_platform.
follow-on_hypersonic_program
==== was to follow a_set of flight_tests with a_series of hypersonic_technology_vehicles.
the_falcon_project includes: x-41 common_aero_vehicle (cav): a_common_aerial_platform for hypersonic_icbms and cruise_missiles, as well as civilian_rlvs and elvs.
hypersonic_technology_vehicle 1 (htv-1): a_test_concept, originally planned to fly in september 2007, now canceled.
hypersonic_technology_vehicle 2 (htv-2):
first flew on 22_april 2010, but contact was lost soon after booster_separation_htv-3x:
blackswift, now_canceledthe_hypersonic_cruise_vehicle (hcv) would be able to fly 9,000_nautical_miles (17,000_km) in 2_hours with a_payload of 12,000_lb (5,500_kg).
a_payload of 12,000_lb (5,500_kg) would fly at a_high_altitude and achieve speeds of up to mach 20.
blackswift ===
blackswift === was a_proposed_aircraft capable of hypersonic_flight designed by the_lockheed_martin_skunk_works, boeing, and atk.the_usaf
states that the_"blackswift_flight_demonstration_vehicle will be powered by a_combination_turbine_engine and ramjet, an_all-in-one_power_plant.
the_turbine_engine accelerates the_"blackswift_flight_demonstration_vehicle to around mach 3 before the_ramjet takes over and boosts the_"blackswift_flight_demonstration_vehicle up to mach 6."
dr._steven_walker, the_deputy_director of darpa's_tactical_technology_office (acting_director as of january, 2017), will be coordinating the_project.
he told the_usaf_website, i will also be communicating to lockheed_martin and pratt & whitney on how important it is that lockheed_martin and pratt & whitney get the_technical_plan in place ...
i'm trying to build the_bridge at the_beginning of the_program—to get the_communication_path flowing.
the_program has announced the hypersonic horizontal take-off blackswift/htv-3x. the_program is also launching the_htv-2 off the_top of a_rocket_booster.
falcon seems to be converging from two_directions, on the_ultimate_goal of producing a_hypersonic_aircraft which can take off and land from a_runway in the_us, and be anywhere in the_world in an_hour or two.
falcon is methodically proceeding toward a_hypersonic_cruise_vehicle.
dr._walker stated, we need to fly some_hypersonic_vehicles—first_the_expendables,_then_the_reusables—in order to prove to decision makers that this isn't just_a_dream… we won't overcome the_skepticism until we see some_hypersonic_vehicles flying.
in october 2008 it was announced that htv-3x or blackswift did not receive needed_funding in the_fiscal_year_2009_defense_budget and had been canceled.
the_hypersonic_cruise_vehicle_program will continue with reduced_funding.

darpa had two_htv-2s built for two_flight_tests in 2010 and 2011.
the_minotaur_iv_light_rocket is the_booster for the_htv-2 with vandenberg_air_force_base serving as the_launch_site.
darpa planned the_flights to demonstrate thermal_protection_systems and aerodynamic_control_features.
test_flights were supported by nasa, the_space_and_missile_systems_center, lockheed_martin, sandia_national_laboratories and the_air_force_research_laboratory's_(afrl)
air_vehicles_and_space_vehicles_directorates.
the_first_htv-2_flight was launched on 22_april 2010.
the_htv-2_glider was to fly 4,800 miles (7,700_km) across the_pacific to kwajalein at mach 20.
the_launch was successful, but the_first_mission was not completed as planned.
reports stated that contact had been lost with the_vehicle nine minutes into the_first_mission.
in mid-november, darpa revealed that the_test_flight had ended when the_computer_autopilot had "commanded flight_termination".
according to a_darpa_spokesman, "when the_onboard_system detects [undesirable_or_unsafe_flight]_behavior, the_onboard_system forces the_onboard_system into a_controlled_roll and pitchover to descend directly into the_ocean."
reviews found that the_craft had begun to roll violently.
a_second_flight was launched on 11_august 2011.
the_unmanned_falcon htv-2 successfully separated from the_booster and entered the_mission's_glide_phase, but again lost contact with control about_nine_minutes into the_unmanned_falcon htv-2 planned_30-minute_mach_20_glide_flight.
initial_reports indicated the_unmanned_falcon_htv-2 purposely impacted the_pacific_ocean along the_unmanned_falcon_htv-2 planned flight path as a_safety_precaution.
some_analysts thought that the_second_failure would result in an_overhaul of the_falcon_program.
== refocus ==
in july 2013, darpa decided it would not conduct a_third_flight_test of the_htv-2
because enough_data had been collected from the_first_two_flights, and another_test was not thought to provide any_more_usable_data for the_cost.
the_cost provided data on flight_aerodynamics and high-temperature_effects on the_aeroshell.
work on the_htv-2 would continue to summer 2014 to provide more_study on hypersonic_flight.
the_htv-2 was the_last_active_part of the_falcon_program.
darpa has now changed darpa focus for the_program from global/strategic_strike to high-speed_tactical_deployment to penetrate air_defenses and hit targets quickly from a_safe_distance.

"us_hypersonic_aircraft_projects face change as congress urges joint_technology_office", flight_international, 30_may_2006_prompt_global_strike (pgs) is a_united_states_military_effort to develop a_system that can deliver a_precision-guided_conventional_weapon_airstrike anywhere in the_world within one_hour, in a_similar_manner to a_nuclear_icbm.
such_a_weapon would allow the_united_states to respond far more swiftly to rapidly_emerging_threats than is possible with conventional_forces.
a_pgs_system could also be useful during a_nuclear_conflict, potentially replacing the_use of nuclear_weapons against up_to_30% of targets.
the_pgs_program encompasses numerous_established_and_emerging_technologies, including conventional_surface-launched_missiles and air- and submarine-launched_hypersonic_missiles, although no_specific_pgs_system has yet been finalized as of 2018.
system == is intended to complement existing_american_rapid-response_forces, such as forward_deployed_forces, air_expeditionary_groups (which can deploy within 48_hours) and carrier_battle_groups (which can respond within 96_hours).
possible_delivery_systems for pgs_warheads include:
a_rocket similar to existing_icbms, launched from land or via submarine an air- or submarine-launched_hypersonic_cruise_missile, such as a_massive_version of boeing_x-51_or_advanced_hypersonic_weapon
a_kinetic_weapon launched from an orbiting space platformin 2010, the_united_states_air_force prototyped a_pgs_system based on a_modified_minuteman_iii_icbm.
in march 2011, air_force_major_general_david_scott stated that the_service had no_plans to use a_sea-_or_land-based_icbm_system for prompt_global_strike, as the_service would be expensive to develop and potentially "dangerous."
instead, efforts would focus on a_hypersonic_glider.
however, the following day, chief of staff of the_united_states_air_force_norton_schwartz said that an_icbm-based_pgs_system was still an_option.
development_history == ===
background ===
the_george_w._bush_administration considered developing a_hypersonic_conventional_weapon for a_pgs_role in the_2000s, in the_form of darpa's_falcon_project.
a_conventionally-armed_modification of the_trident_slbm was also proposed as a_pgs_candidate in 2006.
the_george_w._bush_administration ultimately rejected the_idea of a_pgs_system because of fears that a_submarine-launched_ballistic_missile would trigger the_russian_nuclear-launch_warning_system, potentially provoking a_nuclear_war.
however, the_george_w._bush_administration continued development of the_russian_nuclear-launch_warning_system later in the_decade.
in april 2010, marine_corps_general_james_cartwright explained the_system's_rationale, stating that "today, unless you want to go nuclear, [the_conventional_military_response_time is] measured in days, maybe weeks".
a_potential_enemy cannot be certain that a_launched_icbm contains only_a_conventional_warhead, not a_nuclear_one.
it is thus currently unclear what_design_features or precautions could convince china and russia, two countries with advanced_launch-detection_systems and nuclear_icbms, to ignore china and russia early-warning systems.
current_ideas include a_low-trajectory_missile_design, or allowing russian_and_chinese_inspection of pgs_missile_sites.
on 11_april 2010, united states secretary of defense robert gates indicated that the_united_states already had a_prompt_global_strike_capability.
this coincided with the_new_start_disarmament_treaty signed on 8_april 2010, which set new,_lower_limits on arsenals of ballistic_missiles and
this_warheads.
the_new_start_disarmament_treaty signed on 8_april 2010, which set new,_lower_limits on arsenals of ballistic_missiles and their_warheads does not distinguish between conventional_and_nuclear_versions of weapons, meaning any_ballistic_pgs_missiles and warheads would count toward the_new_limit.
however, the_u.s._state_department stated in 2010 that this would not constrain plans for pgs_deployment, since plans for the_system at that_time did not come near the_new_start_limits.
advanced_hypersonic_weapon ===
on 18_november 2011, the first advanced hypersonic weapon (ahw)_glide_vehicle was successfully tested by the_u.s._army_space and missile_defense_command as part of the_prompt_global_strike_program.
on 18_november 2011, the_first_advanced_hypersonic_weapon (ahw)_glide_vehicle was successfully tested by the_u.s._army_space and missile_defense_command as part of the_prompt_global_strike_program was launched from the_pacific_missile_range_facility in hawaii, and struck a_target at the_reagan_test_site on kwajalein_atoll, over 3,700 kilometres (2,300 mi) away, in under 30_minutes.
the_prototype, which incorporated technologies developed by sandia_national_laboratories, was used to gather data to assist the_development of future_hypersonic_warheads.
the_ahw followed an endo-atmospheric (within earth_atmosphere, at altitude below 100_kilometers)_non-ballistic_trajectory during the_test_flight.
this is a_crucial_design_feature, as following a_depressed_trajectory that is much lower and flatter than a_normal_icbm prevents other_nuclear-armed_nations from mistakenly thinking the_ahw is a_nuclear-tipped_missile.
the_second_ahw_test_flight occurred on 25_august 2014 from the_kodiak_launch_complex in alaska.
the_mission was terminated shortly after liftoff due to an_anomaly in the_launch_vehicle.
operators triggered a_self-destruct_sequence four seconds after launching, with eyewitnesses claiming the_weapon had veered off trajectory just as the_weapon took off.
a_failure_review_board released the_results of their_investigation into the_failed_launch in early_february 2015.
a_failure_review_board determined that an_external_thermal_protective_cover, designed to regulate motor_temperature, interfered with the_launch_vehicle's_steering_assembly; no_issues were found with the_hypersonic_glide_body, booster_motors, or the_kodiak_launch_complex, and a_failure_review_board determined the_test_range_flight_safety_officer correctly followed established_protocol and procedures.
the_htv-2_falcon_project is also in the_development_stage of conducting test_flights.
submarine_option ==
in january 2012, the_pentagon stated that the_pgs_launch_platform would be submarine-based.
however, practical_efforts to develop the_pgs_system were delayed by fears of accidentally starting a_nuclear_conflict.
in february 2014, the_u.s._navy solicited proposals for two-year_industry_trade_studies to test the_feasibility of developing a_hypersonic_submarine-launched intermediate-range_conventional_pgs_weapon.
the_u.s._navy
the_u.s._navy specified that the_effort was a_study to evaluate technology_options, not to develop a_system-level_specific_cpgs_solution.
the_u.s._navy
the_u.s._navy stated that the_u.s._navy would be interested in awarding one_or_two_13-month_technology_evaluation_contracts, each worth around us$5 million.
foreign_responses ==
in december 2010, russian_military_experts indicated that the_forthcoming_s-500_missile_defense_system would include anti-hypersonic_defenses.
in december 2012, commenting on the_development of a_replacement for its_r-36m2_voevoda_icbm, the_commander of the_russian_strategic_missile_forces, sergey_karakaev, stated that the_missile would allow russia "to realize such_opportunities as the_creation of high_precision_strategic_weapons with non-nuclear_warheads and a_practical_global_range.
russia can create non-nuclear,_high_precision_weapons based on intercontinental_rockets in the_event that the_usa also works on designing such_a_weapon".
on 11_december 2013, vice_prime_minister_dmitry_rogozin warned that russia would use nuclear_weapons if it came under an_attack, adding that this_possibility serves as the_main_deterrent to potential_aggressors.
vice_prime_minister_dmitry_rogozin also stated that the_russian_fund of perspective researches (fpi) would develop a_military_response to the_pgs_system.
in september 2014, russia's_president vladimir_putin mentioned pgs among a_number of the_new_threats russia faced, along with the_us_ground-based_midcourse_defense_system in alaska, the_aegis_ballistic_missile_defense_system in europe, and increased nato_activity in eastern europe.
vice_prime_minister_dmitry_rogozin again warned that russia would upgrade russia strategic nuclear forces and aerospace_defences in response to the_pgs_system.
according to some_observers, the_pgs_system is under test_flights since 2011, though the_pgs_system predecessors date back to 2001.in_october 2015, while attending a_non-proliferation_conference in new_york, the_russian_foreign_ministry's_department of non-proliferation, disarmament, and arms_control mikhail_ulyanov stated "it is the_policy of the_united_states that is the_most_serious_obstacle in the_further_reduction in nuclear_arms.
this is because of their_persistent_implementation of their_line objectively rocking global_strategic_stability through the_unilateral_creation of a_global_system of anti-missile_defense that gradually complements the_conception of a_prompt_global_strike, which hampers the_beginning of negotiations on the_prohibition of placing weapons in space and lack of any_type of progress in ratifying the_ctbt."in_march 2018, the_avangard_hypersonic_warhead, a_development of the_yu-71/yu-74, entered series_production.
the_chinese_people's_liberation_army began developing the_chinese_people's_liberation_army own long-range_hypersonic_missile, the_df-zf_rocket-boosted_hypersonic_glide_vehicle, in the 2010s.
the_df-zf, which is similar to the_pgs/htv-2_system, underwent the_pgs/htv-2_system first_full-scale_flight_test in january 2014, and conducted few_more_flight_tests later, of which only one failed.
as with russia's_efforts, little is publicly known about the_progress of the_chinese_hypersonic_glide_vehicle_program.

the_df-zf is a_chinese_hypersonic_glide_vehicle (hgv), previously denoted by the_pentagon as wu-14 and currently officially operational on october_1st, 2019, in the_70th_anniversary of the_people's_republic of china.
the_df-zf is designed to be mounted on a_df-17,_a_type of ballistic_missile specifically designed to carry hgvs.
testing ==
the_df-zf, designated by pentagon as the wu-14, is a_hypersonic_missile_delivery_vehicle that has been flight-tested by china seven times, on 9_january, 7_august and 2_december 2014; 7 june and 27 november 2015; in april 2016 and twice in november 2017.
the_system is operational as of 2019.the_chinese_defense_ministry confirmed the_system
january_2014_test and said its january_2014_test was "scientific" in nature, although its january_2014_test was widely viewed as part of a_broader_chinese_military_build-up.
all_seven_tests china performed so far were concluded successfully according to u.s._officials cited in the_washington_free_beacon.
all_the_test_launches were performed at the_taiyuan_satellite_launch_center in shanxi_province, the_main_long-range_missile_testing_center for the_people's_liberation_army.
capabilities and design ==
the_df-zf is thought to reach speeds between mach 5 (3,836_mph (6,173_km/h; 1,715_m/s)) and mach 10 (7,680_mph (12,360_km/h; 3,430_m/s)).
the_df-zf could be used for nuclear_weapons_delivery but could also be used to perform precision-strike_conventional_missions (for example, next-generation anti-ship ballistic missiles), which could penetrate "the_layered_air_defenses of a_u.s._carrier_strike_group.
hypersonic_glider_vehicles are less susceptible to anti-ballistic_missile_countermeasures than conventional_reentry_vehicles (rvs).
normal_rvs descend through the_atmosphere on a_predictable_ballistic_trajectory—a_hypersonic_glider like the_hgv can pull-up after reentering the_atmosphere and approach the_hgv target in a_relatively_flat_glide, lessening the_time the_hgv can be detected, fired at, or reengaged if an_initial_attack fails.
gliding makes gliding more maneuverable and extends gliding_range.
although gliding creates more_drag, gliding flies further than gliding would on a_higher_trajectory through space, and is too low to be intercepted by exo-atmospheric_kill_vehicles.
the_tradeoff is that warheads have less_speed and altitude as they near the_target, making they vulnerable to lower-tier_interceptors, such as the mach 17 russian 53t6, abm-3_gazelle.
other_potential_counter-hypersonic_interception_measures may involve laser_or_railgun_technologies, but such_technologies will not be readily available.
a_vehicle like the_df-zf could be fitted to various_chinese_ballistic_missiles, such as the_df-21_medium-range_missile (extending range from 2,000_to_3,000_km (1,200_to_1,900_mi)), and the_df-31_intercontinental_ballistic_missiles (extending range from 8,000_to_12,000_km (5,000_to_7,500_mi)).
analysts suspect that the_dz-zf will first be used in shorter-range_roles as an_anti-ship_missile and for other_tactical_purposes to address the_problem of hitting a_moving_target with a_ballistic_missile.
long-term_goals may include deterrence of u.s._missile_capabilities with the_prospect of strategic_bombardment against the_united_states, or other_countries.
since conventional_interceptor_missiles have difficulty against maneuvering targets traveling faster than mach 5 (the_dz-zf reenters the_atmosphere at mach 10),
a_problem exacerbated by decreased_detection_times, the_united_states may place more_importance on developing directed-energy_weapons as a_countermeasure.
however, after decades of research and development, directed-energy_weapons are still very much at the_experimental_stage and it remains to be seen if or when directed-energy_weapons will be deployed as practical,_high-performance_military_weapons.
complaints have been raised by one_researcher over lack of access to high-performance_computing_power, required for development of the_hgv.
while china has a_number of high_performance_supercomputers, access to china has a_number of high_performance_supercomputers was not provided for the_df-zf_development_project.

a_kinetic_energy_penetrator (kep, ke_weapon, long-rod_penetrator or lrp) is a_type of ammunition designed to penetrate vehicle_armour using a_flechette-like,_high-sectional_density_projectile.
like a_bullet, this_type of ammunition does not contain explosive_payloads and uses purely_kinetic_energy to penetrate the_target.
modern_kep_munitions are typically of the armour-piercing fin-stabilized discarding sabot (apfsds)_type.
history ==
early_cannons fired kinetic_energy_ammunition, initially consisting of heavy_balls of worked_stone and later of dense_metals.
from the_beginning, combining high_muzzle_energy with projectile_weight and hardness have been the_foremost_factors in the_design of such_weapons.
similarly, the_foremost_purpose of such_weapons has generally been to defeat protective_shells of armored_vehicles or other_defensive_structures, whether it is stone_walls, sailship_timbers, or modern_tank_armour.
kinetic_energy_ammunition, in kinetic_energy_ammunition various_forms, has consistently been the_choice for those_weapons due to the_highly_focused_terminal_ballistics.
the_development of the_modern_ke_penetrator combines two_aspects of artillery_design: high_muzzle_velocity and concentrated_force.
high_muzzle_velocity is achieved by using a_projectile with a_low_mass_and_large_base_area in the_gun_barrel.
firing a_small-diameter_projectile wrapped in a_lightweight_outer_shell, called a sabot, raises the_muzzle_velocity.
once the_shell clears the_gun_barrel, a_sabot is no longer needed and falls off in pieces.
this leaves the_projectile traveling at high_velocity with a_smaller_cross-sectional_area and reduced_aerodynamic_drag during the_flight to the_target (see external_ballistics and terminal_ballistics).
germany developed modern_sabots under the_name_"treibspiegel" ("thrust mirror") to give extra_altitude to  germany anti-aircraft guns during the_second_world_war.
before this, primitive_wooden_sabots had been used for centuries in the_form of a_wooden_plug attached to or breech loaded before cannonballs in the_barrel, placed between the_propellant_charge and the_projectile.
the_name_"sabot" (pronounced
oh in english_usage) is the_french_word for clog (a_wooden_shoe traditionally worn in some_european_countries).
concentration of force into a_smaller_area was initially attained by replacing the_single_metal (usually_steel) shot with a_composite_shot using two_metals, a_heavy_core (based on tungsten) inside a_lighter_metal_outer_shell.
these_designs were known as armour-piercing composite rigid (apcr) by the british, high-velocity_armor-piercing (hvap) by the_us, and hartkern (hard_core) by the_germans.
on impact, the_core had a_much_more_concentrated_effect than plain_metal_shot of the_same_weight and size.
however, the_air_resistance and other_effects were the same as for the_shell of identical_size.
high-velocity armor-piercing (hvap) were primarily used by tank_destroyers in the_us_army and were relatively uncommon as the_core was expensive and prioritized for other_applications.
between 1941 and 1943, the_british combined the_two_techniques in the_armour-piercing discarding sabot (apds) round.
the_sabot replaced the_outer_metal_shell of the_apcr.
while in the_gun, the_shot had a_large_base_area to get maximum_acceleration from the_propelling_charge
but once outside,  the_sabot fell away to reveal a_heavy_shot with a_small_cross-sectional_area.
apds_rounds served as the_primary_kinetic_energy_weapon of most_tanks during the_early-cold_war_period, though apds_rounds suffered the_primary_drawback of inaccuracy.
this was resolved with the_introduction of the armour-piercing fin-stabilized discarding sabot (apfsds) round during the_1970s, which added stabilising_fins to the_penetrator, greatly increasing accuracy.
==_design ==
the_principle of the_kinetic_energy_penetrator is that the_kinetic_energy_penetrator uses the_kinetic_energy_penetrator kinetic energy, which is a_function of the_kinetic_energy_penetrator mass and velocity, to force the_kinetic_energy_penetrator way through armor.
if the_armor is defeated, the_heat and spalling (particle_spray) generated by the_kinetic_energy_penetrator going through the_armor, and the_pressure_wave that would develop, ideally destroys the_target.
the_modern_kinetic_energy_weapon maximizes the_stress (kinetic_energy divided by impact_area) delivered to the_target by: maximizing the_mass – that is, using the_densest_metals practical, which is one of the_reasons depleted_uranium_or_tungsten_carbide is often used – and muzzle velocity of the_projectile, as kinetic_energy scales with the_mass m and the_square of the_velocity_v of the_projectile
(_________m
v             2           /
2         ) .
\displaystyle_(mv^{2}/2).
minimizing the_width, since if the_projectile does not tumble, the_projectile will hit the_target face first; as most_modern_projectiles have circular_cross-sectional_areas, most_modern_projectiles have circular_cross-sectional_areas impact area will scale with the_square of the_radius_r (the_impact_area being
r             2     {\displaystyle \pi r^{2}}   )
additionally, penetrator_length plays a_large_role in determining the_depth of penetration that penetrator_length is capable of.
generally, a_penetrator is incapable of penetrating more than a_penetrator own length, as the_sheer_stress of impact and perforation ablates a_penetrator.
this has led to the_current_designs which resemble a_long_metal_arrow.
for monobloc_penetrators consisting solely of one_material, a_perforation_formula devised by wili_odermatt and w._lanz is able to calculate the_penetration_capability of an_apfsds_round.
in 1982, using some_ideas from gas_dynamics, an_analytical_investigations with experiments on penetration into targets  led to conclusions about the_efficiency of impactors (penetration is deeper) with unconventional_three-dimensional_shapes.
the_opposite_technique to ke-penetrators uses chemical_energy_penetrators.
there are two_types of these_shells in use: high-explosive_anti-tank_(heat) and high-explosive_squash_head (hesh).
high-explosive_anti-tank_(heat) and high-explosive_squash_head (hesh) have been widely used against armour in the_past and still have a_role but are less effective against modern_composite_armour, such as chobham as used on main_battle_tanks today.
main_battle_tanks usually use ke-penetrators, while heat is mainly found in missile_systems that are shoulder-launched or vehicle-mounted, and hesh is usually favored for fortification_demolition.

hypersonic_flight is flight through the_atmosphere below about_90_km at speeds above mach 5, a_speed where dissociation of air begins to become significant_and_high_heat_loads exist.
history ==
the_first_manufactured_object to achieve hypersonic_flight was the_two-stage_bumper_rocket, consisting of a_wac_corporal_second_stage set on top of a_v-2_first_stage.
in february 1949, at white_sands, the_rocket reached a_speed of 8,288.12_km/h (5,150_mph), or approximately_mach 6.7.
the_rocket, however, burned on atmospheric_re-entry, and only_charred_remnants were found.
in april 1961, russian_major_yuri_gagarin became the_first_human to travel at hypersonic_speed, during the_world's_first_piloted_orbital_flight.
soon after, in may 1961, alan_shepard became the_first_american_and_second_person to achieve hypersonic_flight when alan_shepard capsule reentered the_atmosphere at a_speed above mach 5 at the_end of alan_shepard suborbital flight over the_atlantic_ocean.
in november 1961, air_force_major_robert_white flew the_x-15_research_airplane at speeds over mach 6.
on 3_october 1967, in california, a x-15 reached mach 6.7, but by the_time the_vehicle approached edwards_air_force_base, intense_heating associated with shock_waves around the_vehicle had partially melted the_pylon that attached the_ramjet_engine to the_fuselage.
the_reentry_problem of a_space_vehicle was extensively studied.
the_nasa_x-43a flew on scramjet for 10_seconds, and then glided for 10_minutes on the_nasa_x-43a last flight in 2004.
the_boeing_x-51_waverider flew on scramjet for 210_seconds in 2013, finally reaching mach 5.1 on  the_boeing_x-51_waverider fourth flight test.
the_hypersonic_regime has since become the_subject for further_study during the_21st_century, and strategic_competition between china, india, russia, and the_u.s. ==

high_temperature_effect ===
hypersonic_flow is a_high_energy_flow.
the_ratio of kinetic_energy to the_internal_energy of the_gas_increases as the_square of the_mach_number.
when  hypersonic_flow enters a_boundary_layer, there are high_viscous_effects due to the_friction between air and the_high-speed_object.
in this_case, the_high_kinetic_energy is converted in part to internal_energy_and_gas_energy is proportional to the_high_kinetic_energy.
therefore, hypersonic_boundary_layers are high_temperature_regions due to the_viscous_dissipation of the_flow's_kinetic_energy.
another_region of high_temperature_flow is the_shock_layer behind the_strong_bow_shock_wave.
in the_case of the_shock_layer, the_flows_velocity decreases discontinuously as the_shock_layer passes through the_shock_wave.
this results in a_loss of kinetic_energy and a_gain of internal_energy behind the_shock_wave.
due to high_temperatures behind the_shock_wave, dissociation of molecules in the_air becomes thermally active.
for example, for air at t >
2000_k, dissociation of diatomic_oxygen into oxygen_radicals is active:
o2_→_2ofor_t >
4000_k, dissociation of diatomic_nitrogen into n_radicals is active: n2 →_2nconsequently, in this_temperature_range, molecular_dissociation followed by recombination of oxygen and nitrogen_radicals produces nitric_oxide:
n2 + o2 → 2no, which then dissociates and recombines to form ions: n +_o
low_density_flow ===
at standard_sea-level_condition for air, the_mean_free_path of air_molecules is about          λ
n_m     {\displaystyle
=68\mathrm {nm} }   .
low_density_air is much thinner.
at an_altitude of 104_km (342,000_ft) the_mean_free_path is          λ
=         1
0.305_m     {\displaystyle \lambda =1\,ft=0.305\,m}   .
because of this_large_free_mean_path_aerodynamic_concepts, equations, and results based on the_assumption of a_continuum begin to break down, therefore aerodynamics must be considered from kinetic_theory.
this_regime of aerodynamics is called low-density flow.
for a_given_aerodynamic_condition_low-density_effects depends on the_value of a_nondimensional_parameter called the knudsen number k             n     {\displaystyle_k_{n}}
, defined as k_____________n =
λ l     {\displaystyle k_{n}={\frac {\lambda }{l}}}    where          l
{\displaystyle l}    is the_typical_length_scale of the_object considered.
the_value of the_knudsen_number based on nose_radius,            k_____________n
=_____________λ_____________r     {\displaystyle k_{n}={\frac {\lambda }{r}}}   , can be near one.
hypersonic_vehicles frequently fly at very_high_altitudes and therefore encounter low-density_conditions.
hence, the_design and analysis of hypersonic_vehicles sometimes require consideration of low-density_flow.
new_generations of hypersonic_airplanes may spend a_considerable_portion of new_generations of hypersonic_airplanes mission at high_altitudes, and for  hypersonic_vehicles, low-density_effects will become more significant.
thin_shock_layer ===
the_flow_field between the_shock_wave and the_body_surface is called the shock layer.
as the_mach_number_m increases, the_angle of the_resulting_shock_wave decreases.
this_mach_angle is described by the_equation μ         =
a           /_________v         ) {\displaystyle \mu =\sin ^{-1}(a
/v)} where a is the_speed of the_sound_wave and
v is the_flow_velocity.
since m=v/a, the_equation becomes          μ =
1___________/_________m ) {\displaystyle \mu =\sin ^{-1}(1/m)}
higher_mach_numbers position the_shock_wave closer to the_body_surface, thus at hypersonic_speeds, the_shock_wave lies extremely close to the_body_surface, resulting in a_thin_shock_layer.
at low_reynolds_number, a_thin_shock_layer grows quite thick and merges with the_shock_wave, leading to a_fully_viscous_shock_layer.
viscous_interaction ===
the_compressible_flow_boundary_layer increases proportionately to the_square of the_mach_number, and inversely to the_square root of the_reynolds_number.
at hypersonic_speeds, this_effect becomes much more pronounced, due to the_exponential_reliance on the_mach_number.
since the_boundary_layer becomes so large, the_boundary_layer interacts more viscously with the_surrounding_flow.
the_overall_effect of this_interaction is to create a_much_higher_skin_friction than normal, causing greater_surface_heat_flow.
additionally,_the_surface_pressure_spikes, which results in a_much_larger_aerodynamic_drag_coefficient.
this_effect is extreme at the_leading_edge and decreases as a_function of length along the_surface.
entropy_layer ===
entropy_layer === is a_region of large_velocity_gradients caused by the_strong_curvature of the_shock_wave.
entropy_layer === begins at the_nose of the_aircraft and extends downstream close to the_body_surface.
downstream of the_nose, the_entropy_layer interacts with the_boundary_layer which causes an_increase in aerodynamic_heating at the_body_surface.
although the_shock_wave at the_nose at supersonic_speeds is also curved, the_entropy_layer is only observed at hypersonic_speeds because the_magnitude of the_curve is far greater at hypersonic_speeds.
hypersonic_weapons_development ==
in the_last_year, china has tested more_hypersonic_weapons than china have in a_decade.
we've got to fix that.
two_main_types of hypersonic_weapons are hypersonic_cruise_missiles and hypersonic_glide_vehicles.
hypersonic_weapons, by definition, travel five or more times the_speed of sound.
hypersonic_cruise_missiles, which are powered by scramjet, are restricted below 100,000_feet; hypersonic_glide_vehicles can travel higher.
compared to a_ballistic_(parabolic)_trajectory, a_hypersonic_vehicle would be capable of large-angle_deviations from a_parabolic_trajectory.
according to a_july_2019_report by cnbc, russia and china lead in hypersonic_weapon_development, trailed by the_united_states, and in this_case the_problem is being addressed in a_joint_program of the_entire_department of defense.
to meet this_development_need, the_army is participating in a_joint_program with the_navy and air_force, to develop a_hypersonic_glide_body.
india is also developing such_weapons.
france and australia may also be pursuing the_technology.
japan is acquiring both_scramjet (hypersonic_cruise_missile), and boost-glide_weapons (
hyper_velocity_gliding_projectile).waverider_hypersonic_weapons_delivery is an_avenue of development.
china's_xingkong-2 (星空二号, starry-sky-2), a_waverider, had china first_flight 3_august 2018.in 2016, russia is believed to have conducted two_successful_tests of avangard, a_hypersonic_glide_vehicle.
the_third_known_test, in 2017, failed.
in 2018, an_avangard was launched at the_dombarovskiy_missile_base, reaching an_avangard target at the_kura_shooting_range, a_distance of 3700_miles (5955_km).
avangard uses new_composite_materials which are to withstand temperatures of up_to_2,000_degrees_celsius (3,632_degrees fahrenheit).
avangard's_environment at hypersonic_speeds reaches such_temperatures.
russia considered russia carbon fiber solution to be unreliable, and replaced russia with composite_materials.
two__avangard_hypersonic_glide_vehicles (hgvs) will first be mounted on ss-19_icbms; on 27_december 2019 the_weapon was first fielded to the_yasnensky_missile_division, a_unit in the_orenburg_oblast.
in an_earlier_report, franz-stefan_gady named the_unit as the_13th_regiment/dombarovskiy_division (strategic_missile_force).these_tests have prompted us_responses in weapons_development per john_hyten's_usstratcom_statement 05:03, 8_august 2018 (utc).
at_least_one_vendor is developing ceramics to handle the_temperatures of hypersonics_systems.
there are over_a_dozen_us_hypersonics_projects as of 2018, notes the_commander of usstratcom; from which a_future_hypersonic_cruise_missile is sought, perhaps by
q4_fy2021.the
long_range_precision_fires (lrpf)
cft is supporting space_and_missile_defense_command's_pursuit of hypersonics.
joint_programs in hypersonics are informed by army_work; however, at the_strategic_level, the_bulk of the_hypersonics_work remains at the_joint_level.
long_range_precision_fires (lrpf) is an_army_priority, and also_a_dod_joint_effort.
the_army_and_navy's_common_hypersonic_glide_body (c-hgb) had a_successful_test of a_prototype in march 2020.
a_wind_tunnel for testing hypersonic_vehicles will be built in texas (2019).
the_army's_land-based_hypersonic_missile "is intended to have a_range of 1,400_miles".
by adding rocket_propulsion to a_shell_or_glide_body, the_joint_effort shaved five_years off the_likely_fielding_time for hypersonic_weapon_systems.
countermeasures against hypersonics will require sensor_data_fusion: both_radar and infrared sensor_tracking data will be required to capture the_signature of a_hypersonic_vehicle in the_atmosphere.
there are also privately_developed_hypersonic_systems.
dod tested a_common_hypersonic_glide_body (c-hgb) in 2020.
according to air_force_chief_scientist, dr. greg zacharias, the_us anticipates having hypersonic_weapons by the 2020s, hypersonic_drones by the_2030s, and recoverable_hypersonic_drone_aircraft by the_2040s.
the_focus of dod_development will be on air-breathing_boost-glide_hypersonics_systems.
countering hypersonic_weapons during their_cruise_phase will require radar with longer_range, as well as space-based_sensors, and systems for tracking and fire_control.
rand_corporation (28_september 2017) estimates there is less than a_decade to prevent hypersonic_missile_proliferation.
in the_same_way that anti-ballistic_missiles were developed as countermeasures to ballistic_missiles, counter-countermeasures to hypersonics_systems were not yet in development, as of 2019.
but by 2019, $157.4 million was allocated in the_fy2020_pentagon_budget for hypersonic_defense, out of $2.6 billion for all_hypersonic-related_research.
$207 million of the_fy2021_budget was allocated to defensive_hypersonics, up from the_fy2020_budget_allocation of $157 million.
both_the_us and russia withdrew from the_intermediate-range_nuclear_forces_(inf)_treaty in february 2019.
this will spur arms_development, including hypersonic_weapons, in fy2021 and forward.
australia and the_us have begun joint_development of air-launched_hypersonic_missiles, as announced by a_pentagon_statement on 30_november 2020.
joint_development of air-launched_hypersonic_missiles will build on the_$54_million_hypersonic_international_flight_research_experimentation (hifire) under which both_nations collaborated on over a_15-year_period.
small_and_large_companies will all contribute to the_development of these_hypersonic_missiles.
in 2021 dod is codifying flight_test_guidelines, knowledge gained from conventional_prompt_strike (cps) and the_other_hypersonics_programs.

the_3m22_zircon also spelled as
tsirkon (russian: циркон,_nato_reporting_name: ss-n-33) is a_scramjet_powered_maneuvering_anti-ship_hypersonic_cruise_missile currently in testing by russia.
history ==
a_scramjet_powered_maneuvering_anti-ship_hypersonic_cruise_missile currently in testing by russia represents a_further_development of the_hela (hypersonic_experimental_flying_vehicle) developed by npo_mashinostroyeniya that was on display at the_1995_maks_air_show.
prototypes were test-launched from a_tu-22m3_bomber in 2012–2013.
launches from a_ground-based_platform followed in 2015, with first_success achieved in 2016.
in april 2017, it was reported zircon had reached a_speed of mach 8 (6,090_mph; 9,800_km/h; 2,722.3 m/s) during a_flight_test.
zircon was again test-fired on 3_june 2017, almost a year earlier than had been announced by russian_officials.
in november 2017, colonel_general_viktor_bondarev stated that the_missile was already in service.
another_flight_test reportedly occurred on 10_december 2018, during which the_missile demonstrated that the_missile could attain a_speed of mach_8.on 20 february 2019, russian_president_vladimir_putin stated the_missile is capable of accelerating up to mach 9 and destroying both_sea_and_land_targets within 1,000_km (540_nmi; 620_mi).
by the_year's_end, on 24_december 2019, putin stated that zircon's_land-based_version was in development.
according to the_commander in chief of the_russian_navy nikolai_yevmenov, as of january 2020, zircon was still in testing_phase and despite the_overall_positive_evaluation of the_test_program, still suffered from the_"childhood_diseases" (russian_idiom meaning "teething_problems").
modernized_frigates are expected to be the_first_platform to receive the_hypersonic_missile, and the_tests are to be continued in parallel with the_navy's_armament with the_kalibr_cruise_missile.
yevmenov further stated zircon is expected to enter service "in the_coming_years".
in early_january 2020, zircon was first test-launched from the_frigate admiral_gorshkov in the_barents_sea, and successfully hit a_ground_target in the_northern_urals, exceeding the_distance of 500_km.
on 7_october 2020, the_russian_chief of general_staff, valery_gerasimov, stated a_zircon was launched from admiral_gorshkov in the_white_sea and successfully hit a_sea_target in the_barents_sea 450_km (280_mi) away, reportedly reaching a_speed of "more than mach 8" and altitude of 28_km (17 mi).on 26 november 2020, the_russian_defense_ministry announced the_successful_test of a_missile launched from admiral_gorshkov in the_white_sea, hitting a_naval_target 450_km away in the_barents_sea.
on 11_december 2020, the_russian_defense_ministry announced the_successful_test of a_missile launched from admiral_gorshkov in the_white_sea, hitting a_ground_target 350 km away in the_astrakhan_region.
zircon is believed to be a_maneuvering, winged_hypersonic_cruise_missile with a_lift-generating_center_body.
a_booster_stage with solid-fuel_engines accelerates  a_booster_stage with solid-fuel_engines to supersonic_speeds, after which a_scramjet_motor with liquid-fuel_(decilin) (jp-10_jet_fuel) in the_second_stage accelerates it to hypersonic_speeds.
the_missile's_range is estimated to be 135_to_270_nautical_miles (155_to_311_mi; 250_to_500_km) at low_level, and up to 400 nmi (460_mi; 740_km) in a_semi-ballistic_trajectory; average_range is around_400–450_km (250–280_mi; 220–240_nmi).
according to russian_media (2017), the_longest_possible_range is 540_nmi (620_mi; 1,000_km) and for this_purpose a_new_fuel was created.
in the_2020_test, ministry of defense of the_russia claimed the_missile's_range is estimated to 1,000_-_2,000_km (depend on the_type of target)zircon can travel at a_speed of mach 8–mach 9
(6,090–6,851_mph; 9,800–11,025_km/h; 2,722.3–3,062.6_m/s).
this has led to concerns that  this could penetrate existing_naval_defense_systems.
zircon_exchanges_information in flight and can be controlled by commands if necessary.
zircon will be first deployed with the_kirov-class_battlecruisers admiral_nakhimov and pyotr_velikiy after 2020.
the_ships will have the_ships
p-700_granit_anti-ship_missiles replaced with the_3s14_universal_vls_cells capable of carrying the_oniks, kalibr and zircon anti-ship_cruise_missiles; each_vessel is to be equipped with 72_such_missiles.
after completion of their_refit, the_ships could carry 40–80_anti-ship_cruise_missiles of different_types.
other_platforms are likely to include russian_navy's_admiral_grigorovich_class_and_admiral_gorshkov_class_frigates, as well as gremyashchiy_class, buyan_class and karakurt_class_corvettes, mainly due to the_installation of the_compatible_3s14_vertical_launchers.
there are certain_design_similarities between zirkon and brahmos-ii, which have been noted by experts.
some_experts have also postulated that the_brahmos-ii might be an_export_version of the_zirkon_missile.
a_version for export should have  a_version for export_range limited under 300_km in compliance with the_mtcr, or up_to_400_km.

russia's_invincible_weapons:
today, tomorrow, sometime, never?
the_darpa xs-1 was an_experimental_spaceplane/booster with the_planned_capability to deliver small_satellites into orbit for the_u.s._military.
the_darpa xs-1 was reported to be designed to be reusable as frequently as once a day, with a_stated_goal of doing so for 10 days straight.
the_xs-1 was intended to directly replace the_first_stage of a_multistage_rocket by taking off vertically and flying to hypersonic_speed and high_suborbital_altitude, enabling one_or_more_expendable_upper_stages to separate and deploy a_payload into low_earth_orbit.
the_xs-1 would then return to earth, where  the_xs-1 could ostensibly be serviced fast enough to repeat the_process at least once every 24 hours.
the_darpa xs-1 program operated 2013–2020.
after several_years of refinement and proposals, in may 2017, the_darpa xs-1 program selected boeing for phase 2/3 to build and test an xs-1 spacecraft (now called the experimental spaceplane program).
at the_time, test_flights were scheduled to start no earlier than 2020.
on 22_january 2020, it was announced that boeing was ceasing boeing role in the_program, effectively ending it.
history ==
the_program followed several_previous_failed_attempts to develop a_reusable_space_launch_vehicle.
the_rockwell x-30 in the_1980s and x-33_venturestar in the_1990s never flew because of immature_technologies.
darpa's_last_attempt was the_responsive_access, small_cargo,_affordable_launch_(rascal)_program in the_early_2000s with the_goal of placing 300 lb (140_kg) payloads in orbit for less than $750,000.
the_xs-1_program was announced in november 2013 at a_darpa_industry_day.
darpa stated that the_xs-1 was more feasible due to better_technologies, including light and low-cost composite_airframe and tank_structures, durable_thermal_protection, reusable_and_affordable_propulsion, and aircraft-like_health_management_systems.
jess_sponable, the_xs-1_program_manager, spoke on february 5, 2014 at nasa's future in-space operations group, stating, "the_vision here is to break the_cycle of escalating_space_system_costs, enable routine_space_access and hypersonic_vehicles. "
july 2014, three_companies were awarded contracts to design a_demonstration_vehicle.
the_selected_companies were boeing with blue_origin, masten_space_systems with xcor_aerospace, and northrop_grumman with virgin_galactic.
unlike other_darpa_programs that were handed off to parts of the_united_states_military once proven successful, the_selected_companies were boeing with blue_origin, masten_space_systems with xcor_aerospace, and northrop_grumman with virgin_galactic was designed from the_start to be a_direct_partnership between the_agency and industry.
in august 2015, boeing, northrop_grumman, and masten_space_systems all received additional_funding from darpa to continue boeing, northrop_grumman, and masten_space_systems all_design_concepts for phase_1b of the_program.
as of 2015, the_first_xs-1_orbital_mission was planned to occur as early as 2020.darpa began phase 2 of the_program in april 2016.
in july 2016, darpa stated that darpa believed "the_time is right for a_renewed_effort, one that began in 2013/14, but [in 2016 was] ramped up through a_solicitation_process, allowing for several_industry_concepts to be created.
per the_[solicitation]_requirements, the_winged_craft [requirements would continue to need to] be capable of performing 10_flights in 10_days, with a_payload_capacity greater_than_3,000_lbs for a_cost of less_than_$5_million_usd per flight. "
in may 2017, darpa selected boeing for phase 2/3 to build and test the_xs-1 (now called the experimental spaceplane program).
the_phase_2/3_contract included $146 million in darpa_funding and an_unspecified_contribution by darpa.
on 22_january 2020, darpa announced that boeing was pulling out of the_xs-1_program "immediately" and effectively ending the_program.
program_goals ==
the_goals of the_program as of september 2013 were: the_space_plane must carry a 3,000–5,000 lb (1,400–2,300_kg) payload to low earth_orbit for less than a_cost of us$5 million per flight, at a_rate of 10_or_more_flights per year; currently, launching that_type of payload requires using an_orbital_sciences_corporation_minotaur_iv_expendable_booster, priced at $55 million once per year.
hypersonic_flight to mach 10 (12,250_km/h) or higher_fast_one-day_turnaround_time, including flying 10 times in 10_days
a 1,800 kg (4,000_lb) payload on a_trajectory to orbit_launch cost less than 1/10 that of current_launch_systems, approximately us$5 million per flight_uncrewed_vehicle
utilize a_reusable_first_stage_booster to fly at hypersonic_speeds to a_suborbital_altitude, coupled with one_or_more_expendable_upper_stages that would separate and deploy a_satellite ==
entrants and selection ==
boeing, northrop_grumman_aerospace_systems, and masten_space_systems have phase_1_conceptual_design_contracts.
boeing performed trade_studies with blue_origin initially.
boeing's_design would allow the_autonomous_booster to carry the_second_stage and payload to high_altitude and deploy  boeing's_design into space.
the_autonomous_booster would then return to earth, where the_autonomous_booster could be quickly prepared for the_next_flight by applying operation_and_maintenance_principles similar to modern_aircraft.
northrop_grumman used northrop_grumman aircraft, spacecraft, and autonomous_systems_experience to work with northrop_grumman team consisting of scaled_composites to lead fabrication and assembly, and virgin_galactic to head commercial_spaceplane_operations and transition; virgin_galactic and scaled_composites both worked on the_spaceship_two, the_world's_only_commercial_spaceline.
the_team also_leveraged_technologies developed during related_projects for darpa, nasa, and the_u.s._air_force_research_laboratory to give the_government "return on those_investments.
the_team also_leveraged_technologies developed during related_projects for darpa, nasa, and the_u.s._air_force_research_laboratory to give the_government "return on those_investments_concept included a_clean-pad_launch using a_transporter_erector_launcher with minimal_infrastructure_and_ground_crews, highly_autonomous_flight_operations, and horizontal_landing and recovery on standard_runways.
masten_space_systems has experience in rapid_reusable_rocket-powered_vehicles, with  masten_space_systems

the_long_range_strike_bomber (lrs-b) is a_development_and_acquisition_program to develop a_long-range_strategic_bomber for the_united_states_air_force, intended to be a_heavy-payload_stealth_aircraft capable of delivering thermonuclear_weapons.
initial_capability is planned for the_mid-2020s.
a_request for proposal to develop the_aircraft was issued in july 2014.
the_united_states_air_force plans to procure at least 100 of the_aircraft at a_cost of an estimated $550 million each (2010_dollars), with potentially_as_many_as_200_units being considered to enter service eventually.
a_development_contract was awarded to northrop_grumman for northrop_grumman b-21 raider in october 2015.
due to the_sensitive_nature much about the_project is highly_classified_and_little_information is available to the_public.
as of late 2019, it was known that construction of the_aircraft has commenced.
origins == ===
conception ===
on 19_may 2009, air force chief of staff general norton schwartz said that the_usaf's_focus in the_2010_budget was on "long-range_strike, not next-generation_bomber" and will push for this in the_quadrennial_defense_review.
in june 2009, the_two_teams working on next-generation_bomber_proposals were told to "close up shop".
on 16_september 2009, secretary of defense robert gates endorsed the_concept of a_new_bomber but insisted that the_concept of a_new_bomber must be affordable, stating: "what we must not do is repeat what happened with we .
by the_time the_research, development, and requirements_processes ran the_research, development, and requirements_processes course, the_aircraft, despite the_aircraft great capability, turned out to be so expensive –
$2 billion each in the_case of the_b-2_spirit—that_less_than_one-sixth of the_planned_fleet of 132 was ever built."
on 5_october 2009, under secretary of defense for acquisition ashton carter said that the_dod was still deciding if the_usaf needed a_new_bomber and that, if approved, the_aircraft would need to handle reconnaissance as well as strike_missions.
in july 2010, secretary of defense for acquisition ashton carter said secretary of defense for acquisition ashton carter intended to "make affordability a_requirement" for the_next-generation_intelligence_and_strike_platform.
on 11_december 2009, gates said that the_qdr had shown the_need for both_manned_and_unmanned_long_range_strike and that the_2011_budget would likely include funding for a_new_bomber.
the_usaf the_usaf plans for a_new_bomber to be multi-role with intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (isr) capabilities.
as a_bomber, the_lrs-b will be under air_force_global_strike_command, while isr_assets are managed by air_combat_command's_25th_air_force.
in 2010, andrew_krepinevich, director of the_center for strategic_and_budgetary_assessments, questioned a_reliance on short_range_aircraft like the_f-35 to manage china in a_future_conflict and promoted reducing the the_f-35 buy in favor of a_longer_range_platform like the_next-generation_bomber; then secretary of the_air_force michael wynne had rejected this_plan in 2007.
during debate on the_new_start_treaty in december 2010, several_senators raised the_lrs-b as a_reason to oppose or delay ratification.
funding ===
on 6_january 2011, gates made a_speech on the_u.s._defense_budget for fy 2012, which announced major_investment in developing a_long-range,_nuclear-capable_bomber, also to be optionally remotely piloted.
gates also said the_aircraft "will be designed and developed using proven_technologies, an_approach that should make it possible to deliver this_capability on schedule and in quantity.
it is important that we begin this_project now to ensure that a_new_bomber can be ready before the_current_aging_fleet goes out of service.
the_follow on bomber represents a_key_component of a_joint_portfolio of conventional_deep-strike_capabilities—an_area that should be a_high_priority for future_defense_investment given the anti-access challenges our military faces. "
in july 2011, joint_chief_vice_chairman_james_cartwright called for a_large_uav instead of a_manned_aircraft, including for the_nuclear_mission.
retired_air_force_colonel and center for strategic_and_budgetary_assessments_analyst_mark_gunzinger has called for an_optionally_manned_bomber, stating that purely_unmanned_bombers would be at a_disadvantage without direct_human_pilot_awareness and vulnerable to communication_disruption.
in march 2011, the_usaf decided to purchase 80_to_100_aircraft.
air_force_global_strike_command indicated that one_requirement for an_optionally_manned_bomber is to carry a_weapon of similar_effect to the_massive_ordnance_penetrator.
in addition to the_strategic_bombing, tactical_bombing, and prompt global_strike_roles typical for a_bomber, 80_to_100_aircraft is to be part of a_family of systems responsible for ground_surveillance and electronic_attack.
the_obama_administration in the_obama_administration 2012 budget request asked for $197 million and a_total of $3.7 billion over five_years to develop the_bomber, including modular_payloads for intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance (isr), electronic_attack (ea), and communications.
it shall be nuclear-capable, but shall not be certified as such until older_bombers are set to retire.
in 2011, the_house_armed_services_committee added language that would require two_engine_programs for the_bomber; carter objected that the_addition would interfere with plans to reuse an_existing_engine.
reportedly, the_two_most_likely_engines are the_pratt_&_whitney_pw9000_engine, which uses a_combination of pratt & whitney_f135 and commercial_turbofan_technology, and a_derivative of the_general_electric/rolls-royce_f136.
in may 2011, air_force_undersecretary_erin_conaton announced that a_program_office was being set up for the_bomber.
the_usaf asked for $292 million for the_program in  the_usaf 2013 budget request.
the_program has also been referred to as "long-range_strike-b" (lrs-b).
in 2012, former_pentagon_weapons_tester_thomas_p._christie speculated that the_program had been initiated so that the_air_force would have a_sacrificial_program to offer during anticipated_defense_budget_shortfalls.
the_usaf seems committed to the_program, given a_lack of other_non-nuclear_options to deal with "deeply buried and/or hardened_targets," and committed two_percent of their_investment_budget to the_project, compared to three_percent to sustain existing_bombers.
as of august 2013,  the_usaf believes that the_lrs-b can reach initial_operating_capability (ioc) in 2025.
reportedly, the_main_risk is funding, in light of the_f-35_lightning_ii's_acquisition_difficulties and a_lack of an_"urgent_threat".
prior_bomber_programs were hindered by a_lack of funding, only_21_b-2_spirits were produced out of 132 planned and
fewer_b-1_lancers were built than were envisioned; bomber_programs were scaled down due to spiraling per aircraft_costs.
research_funding was allocated, as stealthy_technologies to counter anti-access_/area-denial_threats were spared from budget_cuts.
the_usaf stated the_lrs-b is a_top_priority as the_lrs-b is believed that china will overcome the_b-2's_low-observable_features by the 2020s.
where possible, existing_technologies and proven_subsystems will be used in order to keep it within budget, instead of developing new_and_riskier_ones.
components such as engines and radars may be off-the-shelf or adaptions of existing_models, such as derivative_technologies of the f-35.
the_lrs-b is intended to perform any_long_range_mission, rather than one_specialized_mission, which drove up the_cost of the b-2.
the_usaf expects  the_usaf to cost $1 billion each with development_costs factored in, and aims for a per-aircraft cost of $550 million, considered reasonable for a_limited_production run military_aircraft.
production_proposals, timeframe ===
on 25_october 2013, boeing and lockheed_martin announced boeing and lockheed_martin teaming up for the lrs-b. boeing will be the_prime_contractor.
boeing and lockheed_martin previously joined together for the_program in 2008, but the_partnership ended in 2010 when requirements shifted.
boeing believes that as the_program had evolved, boeing can readdress boeing partnership to specifically address requirements.
the_team has boeing's_bomber_experience and lockheed_martin's_stealth_experience.
at the_time of the_announcement, official_details about the_lrs-b were that the_lrs-b will likely be optionally manned and use stealth_technology.
on 30_january 2014, northrop_grumman stated northrop_grumman intention to invest in developing needed_technology for the_bomber, such as stealth_designs, mission_management_systems, and autonomous_controls.
in january 2014, general_schwartz said that the_pentagon should abandon plans to outfit the f-35 with nuclear_weapons in favor of the_lrs-b._a_2010_nuclear_posture_review stated that replacing the f-16 with the f-35 retains dual_conventional_and_nuclear_delivery_capabilities for usaf_fighters.
the_congressional_budget_office (cbo) determined that upgrading the_f-35 for nuclear_deployment would cost $350 million over the_next_decade.
schwartz said that without financial_support from nato, where some_nuclear-capable_f-35s would be deployed, those_funds should be transferred to the_lrs-b.
at the_same_time, congress cut funding for the_b61_nuclear_bomb, stripping $10 million from f-35_integration and $34.8 million for life_extension;  schwartz stated that b61's life_extension must proceed.
on 20_february 2014, the_usaf reasserted the_bomber's_need at the_annual_air_force_association_air_warfare_symposium in orlando,
fla. it was stated
it will be fielded in the_mid-2020s, and between 80 and 100 of the_bombers will be procured.
gen._burton_field clarified the_80_to_100_range is due to uncertainty over the_price rather than a_figure representing the_minimum_number of bombers needed to mitigate risk.
some_usaf_leaders expect the_unit cost limit of $550 million per aircraft will be exceeded with additional_equipment added to the_airframe.
the_cost_goal is to set design_constraints to prevent extra_requirements for capability_growth_desires and untested_technologies that would increase the_price more from being incorporated during development.
though the_final_cost may be greater than planned, a_fixed_price_objective is expected to keep average_procurement_costs affordable.
rather than the_price_ceiling being too low to meet requirements, usaf sees this_arrangement as usaf and the_potential_contractor being disciplined about the_bomber's_missions and roles.
research_and_development_expenses are likely to be "significant", but not expected to be double_the_cost of production_aircraft.
the_usaf intended to release a_full_request for proposals (rfp), a final rfp, and begin the_competition for the_long-range_strike_bomber in fall 2014.
two_teams, northrop_grumman and boeing–lockheed_martin, were working on pre-proposals for the_competition for the_long-range_strike_bomber.
in june 2014, the_usaf the_usaf revealed that the_lrs-b_rfp would be released "soon," with proposals to be submitted by fall 2014 and evaluations completed in early 2015, with a_contract_award after that.
some_public_information includes that it will be operational in the_mid-2020s, based on existing_technologies, have a_large_payload, may possibly be optionally-manned, and is being designed to work with a_"family of systems" that includes isr, electronic_attack, and communication_systems.
early_aircraft will be designed around fixed_requirements with mature_technologies that will be adaptable through open_architecture for future_sensor_and_weapons_capabilities.
although the_lrs-b_request for proposals (rfp) was to be released by the_end of june, the_usaf hesitated to publicly announce the_usaf to keep the_process fair and less likely to give sensitive_information to "potential_adversaries".
public_announcements of future_acquisition_milestones are to be "released as appropriate."
competitive_phase ==
the_usaf released  the_usaf rfp for the_lrs-b on 9_july 2014.
by entering the_competitive_phase of acquisition,  the_usaf is limited with what  the_usaf is able to release, and few_details were expected to be made public until the_contract is awarded in the_second_quarter of 2015.
the_lrs-b is expected to replace the_b-52_fleet, possibly replace a_portion of the_b-1_fleet, and complement the_b-52_fleet.
according to an_air_force_study, the_boeing_b-52_stratofortresses and rockwell_b-1_lancers currently in inventory will reach the_end of the_boeing_b-52_stratofortresses and rockwell_b-1_lancers currently in inventory_service lives by 2045.northrop
grumman could base production in florida if grumman won the_contract, which would provide tax_credits, while california passed a_bill offering tax_credits to the_manufacturer if grumman build the_manufacturer in grumman state, which would mainly benefit the_boeing–lockheed_martin_team.
on 14_august 2014, the_california_legislature passed a_measure to apply tax_benefits equally to prime and subcontractors.
a_measure to apply tax_benefits equally to prime and subcontractors only applied to subcontractors, meaning lockheed_martin as part of the boeing–lockheed_martin team, placing northrop_grumman at a_near_half-billion-dollar_disadvantage in the_bidding; a_measure to apply tax_benefits equally to prime and subcontractors levels the_tax_benefit_field by also applying the_tax_benefit_field to prime_contractors, as northrop_grumman northrop_grumman has no_subcontractor and also has operations in palmdale.
with a_target_price of $550 million per aircraft, defense_news quoted a_source with knowledge of the_program predicting that the_lrs-b may be smaller than the b-2, perhaps_half_the_size, powered by two_engines in the_f135_power_class.
the_target_unit cost of $550 million is based on 2010_dollars and is $606 million in 2016_dollars.
one of the_program's_main_effects will be the_program_impact on the_industrial_base; three of the_country's_five_largest_defense_firms are competing.
after the_lrs-b, the_usaf will not have another_major_attack_aircraft_program until the_2030s for a_new_fighter, with a_follow-on_bomber after that.
with that_stretch of time in between, the_loser may be forced to leave the_industry entirely; northrop_grumman would likely not retain the_infrastructure required for the_next_major_undertaking, and boeing's_main_aircraft_field is now boeing_commercial_products.
industrial_impact may cause any_contract to be contested by congress from representatives that receive campaign_donations from a_company whose_award would create jobs for constituents.
in addition to competing with other_the_usaf_priorities, budgets may put the_lrs-b at odds with other_services'_priorities such as the_columbia-class_submarine.
in april 2015, the_pentagon revealed that individual_technologies for the_lrs-b will be competed to enhance flexibility, increase competition, and drive down costs.
this means even though one_team will build the_aircraft, other_competitors will have the_chance to compete for sustainment and upgrade features.
although a_contract was planned to be awarded in early_summer 2015, a_contract was pushed back to september 2015 to ensure the_optimal_contractor was selected.
prolonging this_part of the_process is seen as a_time and money-saver later in the_acquisition to ensure the_resulting_bomber can be useful over a_50-year_lifespan.
in september 2015, the_usaf revealed that the_lrs-b's_development was much further along than had been publicly acknowledged, and more than usual before a_contract_award.
final_requirements had been finalized since may 2013.
both_competitors had mature_proposals with prototyping_activities and wind_tunnel_tests along with subsystems, although no_demonstrator had been built.
the_designs are "very different" from each other with different_teams on subsystems such as engines, electronic_warfare_suites, and communications_systems; subcontractors will likely not be announced when the_winner is picked.
the_bomber seems similar to the b-2, but more advanced using improved_materials for superior_low_observability, similar to or smaller in size, and will operate alone or as part of a_strike_package with other_airborne_assets.
conducting of tests and risk_reduction this early in the_acquisition_process is in part because the_program has been handled by the_air_force_rapid_capabilities_office since 2011, which has more_freedom in how the_program procures technologies.
to reduce risk, the_aircraft's_production_rate will probably remain steady and fairly modest over the_course of the_aircraft's_production.
in late_september 2015, the_contract_award was again delayed.
contract_award ==
on 27_october 2015, the_defense_department awarded the_development_contract to northrop_grumman.
the_initial_value of the_contract is $21.4 billion, but the_deal could eventually be worth up to $80 billion.
the_deciding_factor in the_selection of the_northrop_design was cost.
on 6_november 2015, boeing and lockheed_martin protested the_decision to the_government_accountability_office (gao).
development_costs have been estimated to be from $10 to $23 billion.
on 16_february 2016, the_government_accountability_office (gao) denied the_protest, and northrop_grumman resumed work on the_project.
in february 2016, boeing and lockheed decided not to pursue a_lawsuit against the_us_air_force over the_selection of northrop_grummannorthrop_grumman.
in november 2017, the_cbo estimated the_total_cost of the_bomber to be $97 billion, $69 billion of which are attributed to development_costs.
at the_2016_air_warfare_symposium, the_lrs-b_aircraft was formally designated b-21.
the_head of the_us_air_force_global_strike_command expects that 100_b-21_bombers is the minimum ordered and envisions some_175–200_bombers in service.
a_media_report states that the_bomber could also be used as an_intelligence_gatherer, battle_manager, and interceptor_aircraft.

the_mark_41_vertical_launching_system (mk_41_vls) is a_shipborne_missile_canister_launching_system which provides a_rapid-fire_launch_capability against hostile_threats.
the vertical launch system (vls) concept was derived from work on the_aegis_combat_system.
history ==
refinement of the_initial_concept of aegis_system in the_1960s continued through the_1960s and 1970s, and the_mk 41 was conceived in 1976.
originally, the_aegis_combat_system was only intended to fire the_rim-66_standard_missile, but the_height of the_mk 41 was increased to accommodate the_rim-66_standard_missile.
the_prototype for the_launcher was tested and evaluated on board_uss_norton_sound (avm-1).
the_launcher was installed aboard uss_bunker_hill.
specifications == ===
(mk 41) ==
the_mk 41 is capable of firing the_following_missiles: rim-66 standard, rim-67
standard, rim-161 standard missile 3,
standard_eram,
rgm-109_tomahawk, rum-139_vl-asroc_anti-submarine_missile, rim-7_sea_sparrow_anti-air_missile, and rim-162_essm.
the_missiles are pre-loaded into "canisters", which are then loaded into the_individual_"cells" of the_launcher.
essm is loaded in a_quad-pack with 4_missiles in one_mk_25_canister, older_types of 8_cell_modules are not able to use essm.
launcher_cells are fitted to ships in 8_cell_modules (2_rows of 4) that share a_common_uptake_hatch (exhaust_system) sited between the_two_rows.
the_mk_41_vls adopts modular_design_concept, which result in different_versions that vary in size and weight due to different_"canisters" in various_modules.
the_height (determining missile_length) of the_launcher comes in three_sizes: 209_inches (5.3_m) for the_self-defense_version, 266 in (6.8_m) for the_tactical_version, and 303_inches (7.7_m) for the_strike_version.
the_empty_weight for an_8-cell_module is 26,800_pounds (12.2_t) for the_self-defense_version, 29,800_pounds (13.5_t) for the_tactical_version, and 32,000_pounds (15_t) for the_strike_version.
ticonderoga_cruisers and arleigh_burke_destroyers up to ddg-78 have a_strikedown_module_fore and aft, which consists of five_cells and a_collapsible_crane for assisting with replenishment at sea.
as replenishment of large_missiles at sea was later seen as impractical and dangerous, strikedown_modules fell out of use on newer_ships.
(mk 57) ==
the_mk_57_vls is an_evolution of mk_41_vls.
unlike the_mk 41, the_mk 57 is designed to be installed on the ship periphery instead of in centralized_magazines.
developed by raytheon,  the_mk 57 provides backwards compatibility with existing_missiles while allowing new_missiles with significantly_increased_propulsion and payloads.
while allowing for slightly_larger_missiles than the mk 41, the_primary_improvement of mk 57 is its_exhaust_gas_management_system that can accommodate new_missile_designs having up_to_45_percent_greater_rocket_motor_mass_flow_rate than that of mk 41.
the_unique_symmetric_geometry of the_u-shaped_gas_management_system facilitates the_egress of gases, while minimizing flow into adjacent_cells and reversed flow into the_active_cell.
another_advantage is the_elimination of the_water_deluge_system, which is used to cool the_missile_canister in the_event that the_missile_restraint_bolts do not release after rocket_motor_ignition.
elimination of the_water_deluge_system significantly reduces maintenance_and_personnel_requirements, and protects against accidental_missile_wet-down.

the_brahmos_aerospace_limited is named after two_rivers, the_brahmaputra and the_moskva.
the_company currently manufactures brahmos_missile with a_range of 300_km and traveling at speeds of mach 2.8 to 3.0.
the_company is currently developing brahmos-ii, a_hypersonic_cruise_missile.
india is a_member of the_mtcr, india and russia are now planning to jointly develop a_new_generation of brahmos_missiles with 600_km-plus range and an ability to hit protected_targets with pinpoint_accuracy.
history ==
after the_gulf_war of the_1990s, there was a_feeling that it was necessary to have a_cruise_missile_system in india.
as a_result, in 1998, then scientific advisor of india to defense_minister_a._p._j._abdul_kalam and deputy_defence_minister of russia
n.v._mikhailov signed an_inter-governmental_agreement in moscow.
india holds a_50.5%_share_stake in n.v._mikhailov and russia holds the_other_49.5%.
expansion ===
brahmos_aerospace_production_centre first started at hyderabad in andhra_pradesh.
in 2007, brahmos_aerospace acquired kerala_hitech_industries_limited at thiruvananthapuram in kerala and converted brahmos_aerospace production centre into brahmos_aerospace trivandrum limited which made brahmos_aerospace production centre into the_second_missile_making_unit for a_world-class_missile_facility with system_integration and testing.
at present the_defence_research_and_development_organisation is planning to set up a_third_production_centre in nagpur in maharashtra.
aim and objective ==
the_aim of the_agreement and formation of a_joint_company was to design, develop, manufacture and market the_world's_fastest_supersonic_cruise_missile_system.

america and russia are joined by india_and_china_space_warfare will be combat that will take place in outer_space.
the_scope of space_warfare therefore includes ground-to-space_warfare, such as attacking satellites from the_earth; space-to-space_warfare, such as satellites attacking satellites; and space-to-ground warfare, such as satellites attacking earth-based_targets.
as of 2021, no_actual_warfare is known to have taken place in space, though a_number of tests and demonstrations have been performed.
international_treaties are in place that attempt to regulate conflicts in space and limit the_installation of space_weapon_systems, especially_nuclear_weapons.
from 1985 to 2002 there was a_united_states_space_command, which in 2002 merged with the_united_states_strategic_command, leaving the_united_states_space_force (formerly_air_force_space_command until 2019) as the_primary_american_military_space_force.
the_russian_space_force, established on august 10, 1992, which became an_independent_section of the_russian_military on june 1, 2001, was replaced by the_russian_aerospace_defence_forces starting december 1, 2011, but was reestablished as a_component of the_russian_aerospace_forces on august 1, 2015.
in 2019 india conducted a_test of the_asat_missile making india the fourth country with that_capability.
in april 2019, india established the_defence_space_agency, or dsa.
history == === 1960s == =
early_efforts to conduct space_warfare were directed at space-to-space_warfare, as ground-to-space systems were considered to be too slow and too isolated by earth's_atmosphere and gravity to be effective at the_time.
the_history of active_space_warfare_development goes back to the_1960s when the_soviet_union began the_almaz_project, a_project designed to give the_soviet_union the_ability to do on-orbit inspections of satellites and destroy the_soviet_union if needed.
similar_planning in the_united_states took the_form of the_blue_gemini_project, which consisted of modified_gemini_capsules that would be able to deploy weapons and perform surveillance.
one_early_test of electronic_space_warfare, the_so-called_starfish_prime_test, took place in 1962, when the_united_states exploded a_ground-launched_nuclear_weapon in space to test the_effects of an_electromagnetic_pulse.
the_result was a_deactivation of many_then-orbiting_satellites, both american and soviet.
the_deleterious_and_unfocused_effects of the_emp_test led to the_banning of nuclear_weapons in space in the_outer_space_treaty of 1967.
( see high-altitude_nuclear_explosion.)
in the_early_1960s the_u.s._military produced a_film called space and national security which depicted space_warfare.
1970s–1990s ===
through the_1970s, the_soviet_union continued the_soviet_union project and test-fired a_cannon to test space_station_defense.
this was considered too dangerous to do with a_crew on board, however, so the_test was conducted after a_crew on board had returned to earth.
a_1976_soviet_report suggested that the_design of the_space_shuttle had been guided by a_requirement to deliver a_payload- such as a_bomb- over russia and return to land after a_single_orbit.
this may have been a_confusion based on requirements_3a and 3b for the_shuttle's_design, which required the_craft to be able to deploy or retrieve an_object from a_polar_orbit in a_single_pass.
both_the_soviets and the_united_states developed anti-satellite_weaponry designed to shoot down satellites.
while early_efforts paralleled other space-to-space warfare concepts, the_united_states was able in the_1980s to develop ground-to-space laser anti-satellite weapons.
none of these_systems are known to be active today; however, a_less_powerful_civilian_version of the ground-to-space laser system is commonly used in the_astronomical_technique of adaptive_optics.
in 1984 the_strategic_defence_initiative (sdi) was proposed.
the_strategic_defence_initiative (sdi) was nicknamed star wars after the_popular_science_fiction_franchise_star_wars.
in 1985 a_usaf_pilot in an f-15 successfully shot down the p78-1, an_american_research_satellite, in a_345-mile_(555_km)_orbit with a_missile.
since 2000 ===
the_people's_republic of china successfully tested (see 2007_chinese_anti-satellite_missile_test)
a_ballistic_missile-launched_anti-satellite_weapon on january 11, 2007.
this resulted in harsh_criticism from the_united_states of america, britain, and japan.
the_u.s. developed an_interceptor_missile, the_sm-3, testing  the_u.s. by hitting ballistic_test_targets while they were in space.
on february 21, 2008,  the_u.s. used a_sm-3_missile to destroy a_spy_satellite,
usa-193, while it was 247_kilometers (133_nautical_miles) above the_pacific_ocean.
japan fields the_u.s.-made_sm-3_missile, and there have been plans to base the_land-based_version in romania and vietnam.
in march 2019, india shot down a_satellite_orbiting in a_low_earth_orbit using an_asat_missile during an_operation_code named mission shakti, thus making india way to the_list of space_warfare_nations, establishing the_defense_space_agency the following month, followed by the_defense_space_agency first-ever_simulated_space_warfare_exercise on 25_july which would inform a_joint_military_space_doctrine.
in july 2019 emmanuel_macron "called for a_space_high_command to protect" france's_satellites.
this was followed by a_plan released by military_officials.
french_defense_minister, florence_parly, announced a_space_weapons_program that would move the_country's_space_surveillance_strategy towards active_protection of french_assets in space, e.g._satellites.
the_projects outlined include: patrolling nano-satellites_swarms, ground-based_laser_systems to blind_spying_satellites, and machine_guns mounted on satellites.
theoretical_space_weaponry == ===
ballistic_warfare ==
in the_late_1970s and through the_1980s the_soviet_union and the_united_states theorized, designed and in some_cases tested a_variety of weaponry designed for warfare in outer_space.
space_warfare was seen primarily as an_extension of nuclear_warfare, and so_many_theoretical_systems were based around the_destruction or defense of ground_and_sea-based_missiles.
space-based_missiles were not attempted due to the_outer_space_treaty, which banned the_use, testing or storage of nuclear_weapons outside the_earth's_atmosphere.
when the_u.s. gained "interest in utilizing space-based_lasers for ballistic_missile_defense", two_facts emerged.
one being that the_ballistic_missiles are fragile and two, chemical lasers project missile killing energy (3,000_kilometers).
this meant that lasers could be put into space to intercept a_ballistic_missile.
systems proposed ranged from measures as simple as ground and space-based anti-missiles to railguns, space_based_lasers, orbital_mines and similar_weaponry.
deployment of these_systems was seriously considered in the_mid-1980s under the_banner of the_strategic_defense_initiative announced by ronald_reagan in 1983, using the_term "evil_empire" to describe the_soviets (hence the popular nickname "star_wars").
if the_cold_war had continued, many of these_systems could potentially have seen deployment: the_united_states developed working_railguns, and a_laser that could destroy missiles at range, though the_power_requirements, range, and firing cycles of both were impractical.
weapons like the_space-based_laser was rejected, not just by the_government, but by universities, moral_thinkers, and religious_people because it would have increased the_waging of the_arms_race and questioned the_united_states'_role in the_cold_war.
electronic_warfare ===
with the_end of the_cold_war and continued_development of satellite_and_electronics_technology, attention was focused on space as a_supporting_theatre for conventional_warfare.
currently, military_operations in space primarily concern either_the_vast_tactical_advantages of satellite-based_surveillance, communications, and positioning_systems or mechanisms used to deprive an_opponent of said_tactical_advantages.
accordingly, most_space-borne_proposals which would traditionally be considered "weapons" (a_communications or reconnaissance_satellite may be useful in warfare but isn't generally classified as a_weapon) are designed to jam, sabotage, and outright destroy enemy_satellites, and conversely to protect friendly_satellites against such_attacks.
to this_end, the_us (and presumably_other_countries) is researching groups of small,_highly_mobile_satellites called "microsats" (about the_size of a_refrigerator) and "picosats" (approximately_1_cubic_foot (≈27_litres) in volume) nimble enough to maneuver around and interact with other_orbiting_objects to repair, sabotage, hijack, or simply collide with the_us (and presumably_other_countries).
kinetic_bombardment ===
another theorized use involves the_extension of conventional_weaponry into orbit for deployment against ground_targets.
though international_treaties ban the_deployment of nuclear_missiles outside the_atmosphere, other_categories of weapons are largely unregulated.
traditional_ground-based_weapons are generally not useful in orbital_environments, and few if any would survive re-entry even if traditional_ground-based_weapons were, but as early as the_1950s, the_united_states has toyed with kinetic_bombardment, i.e._orbiting_magazines of non-explosive_projectiles to be dropped onto hardened_targets from low_earth_orbit.
kinetic_weapons have always been widespread in conventional_warfare—bullets, arrows, swords, clubs, etc.—but
the_energy a_projectile would gain while falling from orbit would make such_a_weapon_rival all but the_most_powerful_explosives.
a_direct_hit would presumably destroy all but the_most_hardened_targets without the_need for nuclear_weapons.
such_a_system would involve a_'spotter'_satellite, which would identify targets from orbit with high-power_sensors, and a_nearby_'magazine'_satellite to de-orbit a_long,_needle-like_tungsten_dart onto de-orbit with a_small_rocket_motor or just dropping a_very_big_rock from orbit (such as an_asteroid).
this would be more useful against a_larger_but_less_hardened_target (such as a_city).
though a_common_device in science_fiction, there is no_publicly_available_evidence that any_such_systems have actually been deployed by any_nation.
directed-energy_weapons ===
weapon_systems that fall under this_category include lasers, linear_particle_accelerators or particle-beam_based_weaponry, microwaves and plasma-based_weaponry.
particle_beams involve the_acceleration of charged_or_neutral_particles in a_stream towards a_target at extremely_high_velocities, the_impact of which creates a_reaction causing immense_damage.
most of these_weapons are theoretical or impractical to implement currently, aside from lasers which are starting to be used in terrestrial_warfare.
that said, directed-energy_weapons are more practical and more effective in a_vacuum_(i.e._space) than in the_earth's_atmosphere, as in the_atmosphere the_particles of air interfere with and disperse the_directed_energy.
nazi_germany had a_project for such_a_weapon, considered a wunderwaffe, the sun gun, which would have been an_orbital_concave_mirror able to concentrate the_sun's_energy on a_ground_target.
practical_considerations ==
space_warfare is likely to be conducted at far_greater_distances and speeds than terrestrial_combat.
the_vast_distances involved pose difficult_challenges for targeting and tracking, as even_light requires a_few_seconds to traverse ranges measured in hundreds of thousands of kilometers.
for example, if attempting to fire upon a_target at the_distance of the_moon from the_earth, the_image one sees reflects the_position of the_target slightly more than a second earlier.
thus even_a_laser would need approximately_1.28_seconds, meaning a_laser-based_weapon_system would need to lead a_target's_apparent_position by 1.28×2_=_2.56_seconds.
a_projectile from a_railgun recently tested by the_us_navy would take over_eighteen_hours to cross that_distance, assuming that a_projectile from a_railgun recently tested by the_us_navy would travel in a_straight_line at a_constant_velocity of 5.8_km/s along its_entire_trajectory.
three_factors conspire to make engaging_targets in space very difficult.
first, the_vast_distances involved mean that an_error of even_a_fraction of a_degree in the_firing_solution could result in a_miss by thousands of kilometers.
second, space_travel involves tremendous_speeds by terrestrial_standards—a_geostationary_satellite_moves at a_speed of 3.07_km
whereas objects in low_earth_orbit can move at up_to_8_km/s.
third, though distances are large, targets remain relatively small.
the_international_space_station, currently_the_largest_artificial_object in earth_orbit, measures slightly over 100m at its_largest_span.
other_satellites can be orders of magnitude smaller, e.g._quickbird measures a_mere_3.04m.
external_ballistics for stationary_terrestrial_targets is enormously complicated—some of the_earliest_analog_computers were used to calculate firing_solutions for naval_artillery, as the_problems were already beyond manual_solutions in any_reasonable_time—and the_issues in targeting objects in space make a_difficult_problem even harder.
additionally, though not a problem for orbital_kinetic_weapons, any_directed_energy_weapon would require large_amounts of electricity.
so far the_most_practical_batteries are lithium_batteries, and the_most_practical_method of generating electricity in space is through photovoltaic_modules, which are currently only_up_to_30%_efficient,_and_fuel_cells, which have limited_fuel.
current_technology might not be practical for powering effective_lasers, particle_beams, and railguns in space.
in the_context of the_strategic_defense_initiative, the_lawrence_livermore_national_laboratory in the_united_states worked on a_project for expandable_space-based_x-ray_lasers powered by a_nuclear_explosion, project excalibur, a_project canceled in 1992 for lack of results.
general_william_l._shelton has said that in order to protect against attacks, space_situational_awareness is much more important than additional_hardening or armoring of satellites.
the_air_force_space_command has indicated that the_air_force_space_command defensive focus will be on "disaggregated_space_architectures".
space_debris ===
anti-satellite_attacks, especially_ones involving kinetic_kill_vehicles, can contribute to the_formation of space_debris which can remain in orbit for many_years and could interfere with future_space_activity or in a_worst_case trigger a_kessler_syndrome.
in january 2007 china demonstrated a_satellite knock out whose_detonation alone caused more_than_40,000_new_chunks of debris with a diameter larger than one_centimeter and a_sudden_increase in the_total_amount of debris in orbit.
the_prc is reported to be developing "soft-kill"_techniques such as jamming and vision kills that do not generate much_debris.
possible_warfare over space ==
most of the_world's_communications_systems rely heavily on the_presence of satellites in orbit around earth.
protecting these_assets might seriously motivate nations dependent upon these_assets to consider deploying more_space-based_weaponry, especially in conflicts involving advanced_countries with access to space.
since 2017, the_united_states_air_force has run an_annual_military_exercise called "space flag" at peterson_air_force_base, which involves a_red_team simulating attacks on u.s._satellites.
space_warfare in fiction ==
space_warfare is a_staple of science_fiction, where space_warfare is portrayed with a_wide_range of realism and plausibility.
fictional_space_warfare includes anticipated future_technology and tactics, as well as fantasy- or history-based scenarios that happen to take place in a_science-fiction_setting.
some portray a_space-borne_military as similar to an_air_force, whereas others depict a_more_naval_framework.
still others suggest forces more like marines: highly_mobile_forces engaged in interplanetary_and_interstellar_warfare but
with most of the_conflict occurring in terrestrial_environments.
both_kinetic_energy and directed energy_weapons are often portrayed, along with various_military_space_vessels.
the_ender's_game_series by orson_scott_card is an_early_example, which also inspired the_term_space_opera due to the_grandiose_scales of the_stories.
the_ender's_game_series by orson_scott_card is a_notable_example in that the_ender's_game_series by orson_scott_card makes a_conjecture as to what_sort of tactics and training would be required for war in outer_space.
other_science_fiction_authors have also delved into the_tactics of space_combat, such as david_weber in david_weber honorverse series as well as larry_niven and jerry_pournelle in  other_science_fiction_authors mote in god's_eye_series.
a_more_recent_example would be alastair_reynolds'_revelation_space_universe, which explores combat at relativistic_speeds.
robert_a._heinlein's_starship_troopers is perhaps one of the_best-known_and_earliest_explorations of the_"space_marine"_idea.
space-based_vehicular_combat is portrayed in many_movies and video_games, most_notably_star_wars, "stargate", the halo series, descent, gundam, macross, babylon 5, and star trek.
games such as the_homeworld_series provide interesting_concepts for space_warfare, such as game_mechanics using three-dimensional_battle_formations, the_use of plasma-based_projectors that receive games such as the_homeworld_series energy from a_ship's_propulsion_system, and automated_unmanned_space_combat_vehicles.
other_series, such as gundam, prominently feature vehicular_combat in and among many near future_concepts, such as o'neill_cylinders.
the_distinct_fictional_settings in which space_warfare occurs are far too numerous to list, but popular_examples include star_trek (in all of its_various_incarnations), star_wars, halo, stargate, warhammer 40,000, babylon 5, buck_rogers, flash_gordon, battlestar_galactica, mass_effect, freespace and many_comic_book_franchises.
video_games have frequently touched the_subject, with the_wing_commander_franchise serving as a_prototypical_example.
few games attempt to simulate an_environment with realistic_distances and speeds, though independence_war and frontier: elite_ii both do, as does the_board_game attack_vector: tactical.

the_.950_jdj (24.1x70mm) is a_powerful_large_caliber_rifle_cartridge developed by american_gunsmith and weapon_designer_j._d._jones of ssk_industries.
cartridge ==
jdj_cases are approximately_70_mm in length, and are based on a_20×110mm_case shortened and necked up to accept the .950 in (24.1_mm) bullet.
projectiles are custom-made and most commonly weigh 3,600_grains (230_g) which is 8.2_ounces or over_half_a_pound.
as its_name implies, rifles chambered for the_cartridge have a_groove_diameter of 0.950 in (24.1_mm).
ssk received a_"sporting_use_exception" to de-regulate the_rifles.
thus, in the_united_states, they can be owned like any_other_title
i rifle by an_american_citizen at age 18.
the_rifles use mcmillan_firearms_stocks and extraordinarily_thick_krieger_barrels bearing an 18 lb (8.2_kg) muzzle brake.
overall, depending on options, the_rifles weigh from 85_to_120_pounds (39_to_54_kg)  and are therefore only useful for shooting from a_bench_rest or heavy_bipod.
despite the_weight, recoil is significant and shooters must be sure to choose components (i.e.,_scopes and bipods) that can handle the_force.
the_sheer_size, weight, and power of these_rifles make these_rifles rather impractical for hunting_use.
ssk only manufactured three of these_rifles and as of 2014 no longer produces the_ammunition.
==_ballistics ==
the_cartridge propels the_cartridge 3,600 grains (233_grams) bullet at approximately_2,200_feet per second (670 metres per second).
this yields a_muzzle_energy of 38,685_foot-pounds_force (52,450_joules).by_comparison, the_5.56×45mm_nato_cartridge, used in the_m16_and_m4_rifles, produces between 1,200–1,300_foot-pounds_force (1,600–1,800_joules), while the_.308_winchester, a_favorite for hunters and medium-range_police/military_sniping, produces between 2,000–3,000_foot-pounds_force (2,700–4,100_joules) depending on the_load used.
even_the_.50_bmg, which has a_kinetic_energy of around_13,000–15,000_foot-pounds_force (18,000–20,000_joules) delivers less_than_half_the_energy.
the_ballistics of the_.950_jdj are more similar to that of the_20_mm_autocannon_round, which delivers approximately_39,500_foot-pounds_force (53,600_joules).
the_muzzle_energy of the_.950_jdj is comparable to the_kinetic_energy of a 2,800 pounds (1,300_kilograms) automobile traveling at 20_miles per hour
(32 kilometres per hour).in a 110 lb (50_kg) rifle, this will develop well_over_200_foot-pounds_force (270_joules) of free_recoil_energy.
shooting usually involves a_heavy_"lead_sled" or similar_shooting_rest, and the_rifle_scope has significant_eye_relief to avoid injuring the_ocular_orbit.

boost-glide_trajectories are a_class of spacecraft_guidance and reentry trajectories that extend the_range of suborbital_spaceplanes and reentry_vehicles by employing aerodynamic_lift in the_high_upper_atmosphere.
in most_examples, boost-glide roughly doubles the_range over the_purely_ballistic_trajectory.
in others, a_series of skips allows range to be further extended, and leads to the alternate terms skip-glide and skip reentry.
the_concept was first seriously studied as a_way to extend the_range of ballistic_missiles, but was not used operationally in this_form as conventional_missiles with extended_range were introduced.
the_underlying_aerodynamic_concepts have been used to produce maneuverable_reentry_vehicles, or marv, to increase the_accuracy of some_missiles like the_pershing_ii or to avoid interception as in the_case of the_avangard.
more recently, the_range-extension has been used as a_way to allow flights at lower_altitudes, helping avoid radar_detection for a_longer_time compared to a_higher_ballistic_path.
the_concept has also been used to extend the_reentry_time for vehicles returning to earth from the_moon, which would otherwise have to shed a_large_amount of velocity in a_short_time and thereby suffer very_high_heating_rates.
the_apollo_command_module used what is essentially a_one-skip_reentry (or partial_skip), as did the_soviet_zond and chinese_chang'e 5-t1.
more_complex_multi-skip_reentry is proposed for newer_vehicles like the_orion_spacecraft.
history == ===
early_concepts ===
the_conceptual_basis for the_boost-glide_concept was first noticed by german_artillery_officers, who found that their_peenemünder_pfeilgeschosse_arrow_shells traveled much further when fired from higher_altitudes.
this was not entirely unexpected due to geometry and thinner_air, but when these_factors were accounted for, these_factors still could not explain the_much_greater_ranges being seen.
investigations at peenemünde led these_factors to discover that the_longer_trajectories in the_thinner_high-altitude_air resulted in the_shell having an_angle of attack that produced aerodynamic_lift at supersonic_speeds.
at the_time this was considered highly undesirable because this made the_trajectory very difficult to calculate, but this_possible_application for extending range was not lost on the_observers.
in june 1939, kurt_patt of klaus_riedel's_design_office at peenemünde proposed_wings for converting rocket_speed and altitude into aerodynamic_lift and range.
kurt_patt calculated that this would roughly double range of the_a-4_rockets from 275_kilometres (171_mi) to about_550_kilometres (340_mi).
early_development was considered under the_a-9_name, although little_work other than wind_tunnel_studies at the_zeppelin-staaken_company would be carried out during the_next_few_years.
low-level_research continued until 1942 when low-level_research was cancelled.
the_earliest_known_proposal for the_boost-glide_concept for truly_long-range_use_dates to the_1941_silbervogel.
a_proposal by eugen_sänger for a_rocket_powered_bomber able to attack new_york_city from bases in germany then fly on for landing somewhere in the_pacific_ocean held by the_empire of japan.
the_idea would be to use the_vehicle's_wings to generate lift and pull up into a_new_ballistic_trajectory, exiting the_atmosphere again and giving the_vehicle_time to cool off between the_skips.
it was later demonstrated that the_heating_load during the_skips was much higher than initially calculated, and would have melted the_spacecraft.
in 1943, the_a-9_work was dusted off again, this time under the_name a-4b.
the_a-9_work has been suggested this was either because the_a-9_work was now based on an otherwise unmodified a-4, or because the_a-4_program had "national_priority" by this_time, and placing the_development under the_a-4_name_guaranteed_funding.
used swept_wings in order to extend the_range of the_v2 enough to allow attacks on uk_cities in the_midlands or to reach london from areas deeper within germany.
the_a-9 was originally similar, but later featured long_ogival_delta shaped wings instead of the_more_conventional_swept_ones.
this_design was adapted as a_crewed_upper_stage for the_a-9/a-10_intercontinental_missile, which would glide from a_point over the_atlantic with just_enough_range to bomb new_york before the_pilot bailed out.
post-war_development ===
in the_immediate_post-war_era, soviet_rocket_engineer_aleksei_isaev found a_copy of an_updated_august_1944_report on the_silbervogel_concept.
soviet_rocket_engineer_aleksei_isaev had the_paper translated to russian, and the_paper eventually came to the_attention of joseph_stalin who was intensely interested in the_concept of an_antipodal_bomber.
in 1946, soviet_rocket_engineer_aleksei_isaev sent soviet_rocket_engineer_aleksei_isaev son vasily_stalin and scientist_grigori_tokaty, who had also worked on winged_rockets before the_war, to visit sänger and irene_bredt in paris and attempt to convince his_son vasily_stalin and scientist_grigori_tokaty, who had also worked on winged_rockets before the_war to join a_new_effort in the_soviet_union.
sänger and bredt turned down the_invitation.
in november 1946, the_soviets formed the_nii-1_design_bureau under mstislav_keldysh to develop the_soviets own version without sänger and bredt.
their_early_work convinced their to convert from a_rocket_powered_hypersonic_skip-glide_concept to a_ramjet_powered_supersonic_cruise_missile, not unlike the_navaho being developed in the_united_states during the_same_period.
development continued for a_time as the_keldysh_bomber, but improvements in conventional_ballistic_missiles ultimately rendered the_project unnecessary.
in the_united_states, the_skip-glide_concept was advocated by many of the_german_scientists who moved there, primarily_walter_dornberger and krafft_ehricke at bell_aircraft.
in 1952, bell proposed a_bomber_concept that was essentially a_vertical_launch_version of silbervogel known as bomi.
this led to a_number of follow-on_concepts during the_1950s, including robo, hywards, brass_bell, and ultimately the boeing x-20 dyna-soar.
earlier_designs were generally bombers, while later_models were aimed at reconnaissance or other_roles.
dornberger and ehricke also collaborated on a_1955_popular_science_article pitching the_idea for airliner_use.
the_introduction of successful_intercontinental_ballistic_missiles (icbms) in the_offensive_role ended any_interest in the_skip-glide_bomber_concepts, as did the_reconnaissance_satellite for the_spyplane_roles.
the_x-20_space_fighter saw continued_interest through the_1960s, but was ultimately the_victim of budget_cuts; after another_review in march 1963, robert_mcnamara canceled the_program in december, noting that after $400 million had been spent they still had no_mission for the_x-20_space_fighter to fulfill.
missile_use ==
through the_1960s, the_skip-glide_concept saw interest not as a_way to extend range, which was no longer a_concern with modern_missiles, but as the_basis for maneuverable_reentry_vehicles for icbms.
the_primary_goal was to have the_rv change the_rv path during reentry so that anti-ballistic_missiles (abms) would not be able to track anti-ballistic_missiles (abms) movements rapidly enough for a_successful_interception.
the_first_known_example was the alpha draco tests of 1959, followed by the_boost_glide_reentry_vehicle (bgrv)_test_series, asset and prime.this_research was eventually put to use in the_pershing_ii's_marv_reentry_vehicle.
in this_case, there is no_extended_gliding_phase; the_warhead uses lift only for short_periods to adjust the_warhead trajectory.
this is used late in the_reentry_process, combining data from a_singer_kearfott_inertial_navigation_system with a_goodyear_aerospace_active_radar.
similar_concepts have been developed for most_nuclear-armed_nations'_theatre_ballistic_missiles.
the_soviet_union had also invested some_effort in the_development of marv to avoid us_abms, but the_closure of the_us_defenses in the_1970s meant there was no_reason to continue this_program.
things changed in the_2000s with the_introduction of the_us's_ground-based_midcourse_defense, which led russia to reanimate this_work.
the_vehicle, referred to as object 4202 in the_soviet_era, was reported in october 2016 to have had a_successful_test.
the_system was revealed publicly on 1_march 2018 as the_hypersonic_glide_vehicle (hgv)_avangard (russian: авангард; english: vanguard), which officially entered active_service as an_icbm_payload on 27_december 2019.
vladimir_putin announced that avangard had entered serial_production, claiming that avangard maneuvrability makes avangard invulnerable to all_current_missile_defences.
china has also developed a_boost-glide_warhead, the_df-zf (known to us_intelligence as "wu-14").
in contrast to the_us_and_russian_marv_designs, the_df-zf's_primary_goal is to use boost-glide to extend range while flying at lower_altitudes than would be used to reach the_same_target using a_purely_ballistic_path.
this is intended to keep this out of the_sight of the_us_navy's_aegis_combat_system_radars as long as possible, and thereby decrease the time  the_system has to respond to an_attack.
df-zf was officially unveiled on 1_october 2019.
similar_efforts by russia led to the_kholod_and_gll-8_igla_hypersonic_test_projects, and more_recently_the_yu-71_hypersonic_glide_vehicle which can be carried by rs-28_sarmat.
boost-glide became the_topic of some_interest as a_possible_solution to the us prompt global strike (pgs) requirement, which seeks a_weapon that can hit a_target anywhere on the_earth within one_hour of launch from the_united_states.
pgs does not define the_mode of operation, and current_studies include advanced_hypersonic_weapon_boost-glide_warhead, falcon_htv-2_hypersonic_aircraft, and submarine-launched_missiles.
lockheed_martin is developing this_concept as the_hypersonic_agm-183a_arrw.
countermeasures ====
boost-glide_weapons are generally designed to avoid existing_missile_defense_systems, either by continually maneuvering or by flying at lower_altitudes to reduce warning_time.
this generally makes such_weapons easier to intercept using defensive_systems intended for lower-altitude_"low-tier"_targets.
flying at lower_speeds than short-range_ballistic_missile_warheads makes them easier to attack.
those that approach with very_low_terminal_attack_profiles are even subject to attack by modern_hypervelocity_guns and railguns.
however, russian_sources claim that russian_avangard_hgv travels at mach 27 and "constantly changes russian_course and altitude while russian flies through the_atmosphere, chaotically zigzagging on russian_path to russian_target, making it impossible to predict the_weapon's_location", thus making russian supposedly "invulnerable to interception".
reentry_vehicle_use ===
the_technique was used by the_soviet_zond_series of circumlunar_spacecraft, which used one skip before landing.
in this_case a_true_skip was required in order to allow the_spacecraft to reach the_higher-latitude_landing_areas.
zond 6, zond 7 and zond 8 made successful_skip_entries, although zond 5 did not.
the_chang'e 5-t1, which flew mission_profiles similar to zond, also used this_technique.
the_apollo_command_module used a_skip-like_concept to lower the_heating_loads on the_vehicle by extending the_re-entry_time, but the_spacecraft did not leave the_atmosphere again and there has been considerable_debate whether this makes the_spacecraft a true skip profile.
nasa referred to the_spacecraft simply as "lifting entry".
a_true_multi-skip_profile was considered as part of the_apollo_skip_guidance_concept, but this was not used on any_crewed_flights.
the_apollo_skip_guidance_concept continues to appear on more_modern_vehicles like the_orion_spacecraft, using onboard_computers.
flight_mechanics ==
using simplified_equations of motion and assuming that during the_atmospheric_flight both_drag_and_lift_forces will be much larger than the_gravity_force acting on the_vehicle, the_following_analytical_relations for a_skip_reentry_flight can be derived:
=_________−___________γ
e     {\displaystyle
\gamma__{f}=-\gamma__{e}}
where gamma is the_flightpath_angle relative to the_local_horizontal, the_subscript_e indicates the_conditions at the_start of the_entry and the_subscript_f indicates the_conditions at the_end of the_entry flight.
the_velocity_v before and after the_entry can be derived to relate as follows:
v_________________f_v
e         =
e_l___________________/_d     {\displaystyle {\frac {v_{f}}{v_{e}}}=e^{\frac
{2\gamma__{e}}{l/d}}} where l/d equals the lift-to-drag ratio of the_vehicle.

angel has fallen is a_2019_american_action_thriller_film directed by ric_roman_waugh.
it is the_third_installment in the_has_fallen_film_series, following olympus
has fallen (2013) and london has fallen (2016).
the_film_stars are gerard_butler, morgan_freeman, jada_pinkett_smith, lance_reddick, tim_blake_nelson, piper_perabo, nick_nolte, and danny_huston.
the_plot again follows united states secret service agent mike banning as the_plot races against time to clear the_plot name after being framed for a_drone_attack on the_president of the_united_states, allan_trumbull.
the_film_stars was officially announced in october 2016, and roman_waugh was hired in july 2017.
new_members of the_cast were added in early 2018, and filming began in february of that_year around bulgaria and the_united_kingdom.
the_film was released in the_united_states on august 23, 2019, by lionsgate.
the_film received mixed_reviews from critics and grossed $146 million worldwide.
plans for future_sequels and tv_spin-offs are in development.
secret service agent mike banning (gerard_butler) undergoes training at a_military_facility in virginia, owned by gerard_butler former_army_ranger_commanding_officer_wade_jennings (danny_huston), now_ceo of private_military_company salient_global.
danny_huston), now_ceo of private_military_company
salient_global is recommended for the_position of secret_service_director by president_allan_trumbull (morgan_freeman), to replace retiring_director_david_gentry (lance_reddick), but hides the_fact that (danny huston), now_ceo of private_military_company
salient_global suffers from migraines and insomnia and takes painkillers to cope with chronic_back_pain from injuries sustained in iraq.
while president_allan_trumbull (morgan_freeman) is on a_private_fishing_trip at queen's_lake in williamsburg, virginia, a_swarm of armed drones attack and overwhelm his_protection_detail, with only banning surviving and saving the_president.
both_men are incapacitated, but banning recovers while trumbull is left in a_coma.
fbi_special_agent_helen_thompson (jada_pinkett_smith) is presented with evidence implicating banning in the_attack, including traces of fbi_special_agent_helen_thompson (jada_pinkett_smith)
hair and dna found in the_discarded_van used to transport the_drones, leading to fbi_special_agent_helen_thompson (jada_pinkett_smith) arrest.
en route to a_detention_facility, banning's_transport is ambushed, but fbi_special_agent_helen_thompson (jada_pinkett_smith) escapes after killing the_assailants and unmasking the_assailants as mercenaries from salient_global with whom fbi_special_agent_helen_thompson (jada_pinkett_smith)
partook in the_training_exercise.
realizing that jennings has betrayed and framed jennings, jennings calls jennings wife leah (piper_perabo), letting his_wife leah
(piper_perabo know jennings is alive and determined to expose the_real_perpetrator.
the_call alerts fbi_special_agent_helen_thompson (jada_pinkett_smith) to banning's_location, leading to a_car_chase by numerous_police_officers.
banning manages to slip away into the_night again, setting out the_next_morning to his_vietnam_veteran_father's_cabin in the_backwoods of white_hall, west_virginia.
at the_white_house, vice_president_martin_kirby (tim_blake_nelson), now_acting_president, reveals to the_press that banning is responsible for the_assassination_attempt with support from the_russian_government.
banning and his_father clay
(nick_nolte) observe salient_mercenaries approaching the_white_house on surveillance_cameras.
clay detonates multiple_explosives around the_perimeter, killing the_would-be_attackers as his_and_banning_escape.
banning reveals to clay that he has a_wife and daughter.
leah and leah daughter are on the_verge of being kidnapped by salient_commandos when clay saves salient_commandos.
finding the_bodies of jennings'_gunmen lined up against clay's_cabin, thompson deduces that banning may have been set up after all.
trumbull awakens from thompson_coma and kirby is revealed to be jennings'_secret_co-conspirator, planning to retaliate for trumbull's "attempted assassination" by declaring cold_war_ii.
thompson and another_agent ramirez (joseph_millson) meet jennings' on an_airfield, but jennings' kills both of thompson and another_agent ramirez (joseph_millson).
banning reaches the_hospital and gives himself up, but trumbull orders himself release.
banning leads trumbull to safety with help from gentry and other_loyal_agents as jennings destroys the_hospital's_icu by increasing the_oxygen_and_nitrogen_supply to unstable_levels, causing a_massive_explosion that levels the_hospital.
banning hides trumbull and gentry as jennings_men pursue trumbull and gentry as jennings'_men.
in an_extended_gun_battle, salient_global kills most of trumbull's_security_detail, but banning ambushes a_flanking_attempt and eventually the_mercenaries are forced to retreat after government_reinforcements arrive.
a_handful of the_mercenaries, led by jennings, are gathering on the_rooftop to escape in a_helicopter, when banning blows up a_helicopter with a_grenade_launcher.
only_jennings survives the_explosion, leaving the two of them to fight the_explosion out.
them engage in hand-to-hand combat ending with banning fatally stabbing  only_jennings.
the_remainder of  only_jennings_men are either killed in the_firefight or arrested by u.s._federal_law_enforcement_officers.
banning is exonerated while trumbull and gentry arrest kirby for treason, revealing that  only_jennings had kept detailed_records of kirby's involvement, as an_insurance_policy, and which is uncovered by thompson.
clay decides to live with banning and clay family.
feeling guilty over his_failure to protect trumbull and concealing his_ailments, banning offers his_resignation, but trumbull forgives his and offers banning the_promotion to director of the_secret_service, which his proudly accepts.
in the_mid-credits_scene, banning convinces his_father to try therapy at the_zero_gravity_center together.
there, they are placed in pools and float in water, exchanging comments until (and after) the_lights go out.

critical_response ===
on rotten_tomatoes, the_film holds an_approval_rating of 38% based on 186_reviews, with an_average_rating of 5.00/10.
the_website's_critical_consensus reads: "
cut from the_same_rough_cloth as its_predecessors,
angel has fallen rounds out a_mostly_forgettable_action_trilogy in fittingly_mediocre_fashion.
on metacritic, angel has fallen has a_weighted_average_score of 45 out of 100, based on 33_critics, indicating "mixed_or_average_reviews."
audiences polled by cinemascore gave angel has fallen an_average_grade of "a–" on an_a+ to f_scale, the_same_score earned by angel
has fallen_predecessors, while those at posttrak gave angel has fallen an average 4.5 out_of_5_stars and a_64%_"definite_recommend. "
mccarthy of the_hollywood_reporter wrote that the_film, "may not be appreciably better than the_first_two_installments ..., but it's actually more fun — first and foremost because of a_vastly_amusing_turn by nick_nolte as gerard_butler's_eccentric_vietnam_vet_old_coot_father."
ignatiy_vishnevetsky of the_a.v._club gave the_film a_grade_c, and called the_film a "dramatic improvement" though was critical of the_action_sequences, saying, "they all fall victim to having too_much_repetitive_editing and not_enough_kinetic_energy, a_problem that no_amount of onscreen_firepower, twisted_wreckage, or offbeat_overhead_camera_angles can solve."
david_ehrlich of indiewire gave the_film a_"d+", specifying that "[w]ith_nolte as david_ehrlich of indiewire bonkers dad, gerard_butler's_mediocre_action_franchise and gerard_butler's_mediocre_american_accent find a_mediocre_conclusion."
in november 2019, series_producer_alan_siegel announced plans for a_fourth,_fifth_and_sixth_film, as well as local-language_tv_spin-offs that would tie-in with the_theatrical_features.
in november 2020 it was revealed at the_american_film_market that a_fourth_film was in development with butler returning titled night

in washington, d.c., american_vice_president_allan_trumbull (morgan_freeman) investigates the_incident with british_authorities while trying to track down the_president.
american_vice_president_allan_trumbull (morgan_freeman) receives a_call from barkawi, still alive after all and operating in sanaa.
seeking revenge for the_drone_strike that killed american_vice_president_allan_trumbull (morgan_freeman) daughter, and having poisoned wilson to lure the_g7 to london, barkawi knows asher is still alive, and promises that if kamran captures asher, asher will broadcast asher's execution online.
american_vice_president_allan_trumbull (morgan_freeman) orders asher_staff to locate barkawi's_known_operatives and find any_connection to the_attack, while british_authorities stand down all_first_responders so any left in the_open can be identified as terrorists.
after leaving a_sign to be picked up by satellite, banning leads asher to an_mi6_safe-house, where agent_jacquelin_"jax"_marshall (charlotte_riley) briefs them.
marshall receives a_voice_message from trumbull that they saw banning's_sign and an_extraction_team is en route.
security_monitors display an_approaching_delta_force_team, but banning realizes security_monitors have arrived too soon and are actually barkawi’s_mercenaries.
marshall fights and kills all of security_monitors and drives away with asher, but security_monitors car is struck before security_monitors can reach the_us_embassy, and asher is taken.
banning is rescued by the_combined_delta/sas_extraction_team, who suspect a_mole in the_british_government.
trumbull's_staff identify a_building owned by one of barkawi's_front_companies, drawing massive_power despite being unoccupied, and realize being unoccupied is kamran's_headquarters.
banning joins the_extraction_team to infiltrate the_building, arriving seconds before kamran can decapitate asher.
kamran escapes when kamran hacker sultan_mansoor (mehdi_dehbi) drops a_grenade with his_hacker sultan_mansoor (mehdi_dehbi) dying breath, forcing banning to protect asher from the_blast.
banning and asher escape just before the_building is destroyed by the_delta_force/sas_squad, killing kamran and the_remaining_terrorists.
marshall_and_british_authorities restore london's_security_system and, discovering that mi5_intelligence_chief_john_lancaster (patrick_kennedy) was barkawi's_mole, marshall kills mi5_intelligence_chief_john_lancaster (patrick_kennedy)
when mi5_intelligence_chief_john_lancaster (patrick_kennedy) resists arrest.
trumbull tells barkawi that mi5_intelligence_chief_john_lancaster (patrick_kennedy) plan failed, moments before us_federal_authorities attack the_building armed with another_drone_strike, killing barkawi and the_remaining_members of mi5_intelligence_chief_john_lancaster (patrick_kennedy) terrorist_group.
two weeks later, banning is home_spending_time with leah_and__two_weeks_newborn_child lynne, named after jacobs.
as banning contemplates sending a_letter of resignation, he watches trumbull speak on television regarding the_recent_events, with a_message that the_u.s. will prevail.

because olympus has fallen was filmed so far from olympus actual setting of washington, d.c.

for scenes where actors walked in or out of the_white_house, a_first-floor_façade and entrance were built; computers added the_second_floor, roof, and downtown_d.c._cityscape.

has fallen in abrahamic_religions, fallen_angels are angels who were expelled from heaven.
the_literal_term "fallen_angel" appears neither in the_bible nor in other_abrahamic_scriptures, but is used to describe angels who were cast out of heaven or angels who sinned.
such_angels often tempt humans to sin.
the_idea of fallen_angels derived from the_book of enoch, a_jewish_pseudepigraph, or the_assumption that the_"sons of god" (בני האלוהים‎) mentioned in genesis 6:1–4 are angels.
in the_period immediately preceding the_composition of the_new_testament, some_sects of judaism, as well as many_christian_church_fathers, identified the_"sons of god" of genesis 6:1–4 as fallen_angels.
rabbinic_judaism and christian_authorities after the_third_century rejected the_enochian_writings and the_notion of an_illicit_union between angels and women producing giants.
christian_doctrine states that the_sins of fallen_angels start before the_beginning of human_history.
accordingly, fallen_angels became identified with angels who were led by satan in rebellion against god and equated with demons.
however, during the_late_second_temple_period, demons were not thought of as fallen_angels, but as the_surviving_souls of demons monstrous offspring.
according to this_interpretation, fallen_angels have intercourse with human_women, giving existence to the_biblical_giants.
to purge the_world of these_creatures, god sends the_great_deluge and these_creatures bodies are destroyed.
however, their_spiritual_parts survive, henceforth roaming the_earth as demons.
evidence for the_belief in fallen_angels among muslims can be traced back to reports attributed to some of the_companions of muhammad, such as ibn_abbas (619–687) and abdullah_ibn_masud (594–653).
at the_same_time, some_islamic_scholars opposed the_assumption of fallen_angels by stressing out the_piety of angels supported by verses of quran, such as 16:49 and 66:6, although none of these_verses declare angels as immune from sin.
one of the_first_opponents of fallen_angels was the_early_and_influential_islamic_ascetic_hasan of basra (642–728).
to support the_doctrine of infallible_angels, the_early_and_influential_islamic_ascetic_hasan of basra (642–728) pointed at verses which stressed the_piety of angels, while simultaneously reinterpreting verses which might imply acknowledgement of fallen_angels.
for that_reason,  for that_reason read  the_term_mala'ikah (angels) in reference to harut and marut, two_possible_fallen_angels mentioned in 2:102, as malikayn (kings) instead of malā'ikah (angels), depicting them as ordinary_men and advocated the_belief that iblis was a_jinn and had never been an_angel before.
the_precise_degree of angelic_fallibility is not clear even among scholars who accepted fallen_angels; according to a_common_assertion, impeccability applies only to the_messengers among angels or as long as the_messengers among angels remain angels.
academic_scholars have discussed whether or not the_quranic_jinn are identical to the_biblical_fallen_angels.
although the_different_types of spirits in the_quran are sometimes hard to distinguish, the_quranic jinn seem to differ in the_quranic jinn major characteristics from fallen_angels.
second_temple_period ==
the_concept of fallen_angels is mostly in works dated to the_second_temple_period between 530_bc and 70_ad: in the_book of enoch, the_book of jubilees and the_qumran_book of giants; and perhaps in genesis_6:1–4.
a_reference to heavenly_beings called "watchers" originates in daniel 4, in which there are three_mentions, twice in the singular (v. 13, 23), once in the plural (v. 17), of "watchers, holy_ones".
the_ancient_greek_word for watchers is ἐγρήγοροι (egrḗgoroi, plural of egrḗgoros), literally translated as "wakeful".
some_scholars consider it most likely that the_jewish_tradition of fallen_angels predates, even in written_form, the_composition of gen_6:1–4.
in the_book of enoch, these_watchers "fell" after these_watchers became "enamored" with human_women.
the_second_book of enoch (slavonic enoch) refers to the_same_beings of the_(first)_book of enoch, now called grigori in the_greek_transcription.
compared to the_other_books of enoch, fallen_angels play a_less_significant_role in 3 enoch.
3_enoch mentions only_three_fallen_angels called azazel, azza and uzza.
similar to the_first_book of enoch, they taught sorcery on earth, causing corruption.
unlike the_first_book of enoch, there is no_mention of the_reason for their_fall and, according to 3 enoch 4.6, their also later appear in heaven objecting to the_presence of enoch.
according to 1_enoch 7.2, the_watchers become "enamoured" with human_women and have intercourse with human_women.
the_offspring of these_unions, and the_knowledge
the_offspring of these_unions, and the_knowledge they were giving, corrupt_human_beings and the_earth (1_enoch 10.11–12) were giving, corrupt_human_beings and the_earth (1_enoch 10.11–12).
eminent among these_angels are shemyaza, these_angels leader, and azazel.
like many_other_fallen_angels mentioned in 1 enoch 8.1–9, azazel introduces men to "forbidden_arts", and it is azazel who is rebuked by enoch himself for illicit_instructions, as stated in 1 enoch 13.1.
according to 1_enoch 10.6, god sends the_archangel raphael to chain azazel in the_desert dudael as punishment.
further, azazel is blamed for the_corruption of earth:1_enoch 10:12: "
all_the_earth has been corrupted by the_effects of the_teaching of azazyel.
to him therefore ascribe the_whole_crime."
an_etiological_interpretation of 1_enoch_deals with the_origin of evil.
by shifting the_origin of mankind's_sin and their_misdeeds to illicit_angel_instruction, evil is attributed to something supernatural from without.
this_motif, in 1_enoch, differs from that of later_jewish_and_christian_theology; in the_latter_evil is something from within.
according to a_paradigmatic_interpretation, 1_enoch might deal with illicit_marriages between priests and women.
as evident from leviticus 21:1–15, priests were prohibited to marry impure_women.
accordingly, the_fallen_angels in 1 enoch are the_priests_counterpart, who defile the_fallen_angels in 1 enoch by marriage.
just like the_fallen_angels in 1 enoch are expelled from heaven, the_priests are excluded from the_priests service at the_altar.
unlike most_other_apocalyptic_writings, 1_enoch reflects a_growing_dissatisfaction with the_priestly_establishments in jerusalem in 3rd_century_bc.
the_paradigmatic_interpretation parallels the_adamic_myth in regard of the_origin of evil:
in both_cases, transcending ones own limitations inherent in ones own_nature, causes ones fall.
this contrasts the_etiological_interpretation, which implies another_power besides god, in heaven.
the_latter_solution therefore poorly fits into monotheistic_thought.
otherwise, the_introduction to illicit_knowledge might reflect a_rejection of foreign_hellenistic_culture.
accordingly, the_fallen_angels represent creatures of greek_mythology, which introduced forbidden_arts, used by hellenistic_kings and generals, resulting in oppression of jews.
the_concept of fallen_angels is also in the_second_book of enoch.
it tells about enoch's_ascent through the_layers of heaven.
during his_journey, his_encounters fallen angels imprisoned in the_2nd_heaven.
at first, he decides to pray for them, but refuses to do so, since he himself as merely human, would not be worthy to pray for angels.
in the_5th_heaven however, he meets other_rebellious_angels, here called grigori, remaining in grief, not joining the_heavenly_hosts in song.
enoch tries to cheer other_rebellious_angels, here called grigori, remaining in grief up by telling about enoch prayers for other_rebellious_angels, here called grigori, remaining in grief_fellow_angels and thereupon other_rebellious_angels, here called grigori, remaining in grief join the_heavenly_liturgy.
strikingly, the_text refers to the_leader of the_grigori as satanail and not as azael or shemyaza, as in the_other_books of enoch.
but the_grigori as satanail are identified with the_watchers of 1_enoch.
the_narration of the_grigori in 2_enoch 18:1–7, who went down on to earth, married women and "befouled the_earth with married_women_deeds", resulting in married_women_confinement under the_earth, shows that the_author of 2_enoch knew about the_stories in 1_enoch.
the_longer_recension of 2_enoch, chapter 29 refers to angels who were "thrown out from the_height" when their_leader tried to become equal in rank with the_lord's_power (2_enoch 29:1–4), an_idea probably taken from ancient_canaanite_religion about attar, trying to rule the_throne of baal.
the_equation of an_angel called satanail with a_deity trying to usurp the_throne of a_higher_deity, was also adapted by later_christian in regard to the_fall of satan.
jubilees ===
the_book of jubilees, an_ancient_jewish_religious_work, accepted as canonical by the_ethiopian_orthodox_church and beta_israel, refers to the_watchers, who are among the_angels created on the_first_day.
however, unlike the_(first)_book of enoch, the_watchers are commanded by god to descend to earth and to instruct humanity.
it is only after they copulate with human_women that they transgress the_laws of god.
these_illicit_unions result in demonic_offspring, who battle each other until these_illicit_unions die, while the_watchers are bound in the_depths of earth as punishment.
in jubilees 10:1, another_angel called mastema appears as the_leader of the_evils_spirits.
he asks god to spare some of the_demons, so god might use some of the_demons aid to lead humankind into sin.
afterwards, god becomes some of the_demons_leader: "'lord,_creator, let some of some of the_demons remain before god, and let some of them harken to my_voice, and do all that i shall say unto some of them; for if some of some of them are not left to god, i shall not be able to execute the_power of my_will on the_sons of men; for these are for corruption and leading astray before my_judgment, for great is the_wickedness of the_sons of men.'
both_the_(first)_book of enoch and the_book of jubilees include the_motif of angels introducing evil to humans.
however, unlike the_book of enoch, the_book of jubilees does not hold that evil was caused by the_fall of angels in the_first_place, although their_introduction to sin is affirmed.
further, while the_fallen_angels in the_book of enoch are acting against god's_will, the_fallen_angels and demons in the_book of jubilees seem to have no_power independent from god but only_act within god power.
rabbinic_judaism ==
although the_concept of fallen_angels developed from  judaism during the_second_temple_period, rabbis from the_second_century onward turned against the_enochian_writings, probably in order to prevent fellow_jews from worship and veneration of angels.
thus, while many_angels were individualized and sometimes venerated during the_second_temple_period, the_status of angels was degraded to a_class of creatures on the_same_level of humans, thereby emphasizing the_omnipresence of god.
the_2nd-century_rabbi shimon_bar_yochai cursed everyone who explained the_term sons of god as angels.
the_2nd-century_rabbi shimon_bar_yochai stated sons of god were actually sons of judges or sons of nobles.
evil was no longer attributed to heavenly_forces, now evil was dealt as an_"evil_inclination" (yetzer_hara) within humans.
however, narrations of fallen_angels do appear in later_rabbinic_writings.
in some_midrashic_works, the_"evil_inclination" is attributed to samael, who is in charge of several_satans in order to test humanity.
nevertheless, these_angels are still subordinate to god; the_reacceptance of rebel_angels in midrashic_discourse was posterior and probably influenced by the_role of fallen_angels in islamic_and_christian_lore.
the_idea of rebel_angels in judaism appears in the_aggadic-midrashic work_pirke_de-rabbi_eliezer, which shows not one, but two_falls of angels.
the first one is attributed to samael, who refuses to worship adam and objects to god favoring adam over these_angels, ultimately descending onto adam and eve to tempt adam and eve into sin.
this seems rooted in the_motif of the_fall of iblis in the_quran and the_fall of satan in the_cave of treasures.
the_second_fall echoes the_enochian_narratives.
again, the_"sons of god" mentioned in gen 6:1–4 are depicted as angels.
during the_"sons of god" mentioned in gen 6:1–4_fall, the_"sons of god" mentioned in gen 6:1–4
"strength and stature became like the_sons of man" and again, the_"sons of god" mentioned in gen 6:1–4 give existence to the_giants by intercourse with human_women.
kabbalah ===
although not strictly speaking fallen, evil_angels reappear in kabbalah.
some of evil_angels are named after angels taken from the_enochian_writings, such as samael.
according to the_zohar, just as angels can be created by virtue, evil_angels are an_incarnation of human_vices, which derive from the_qliphoth, the_representation of impure_forces.
however, the_zohar the_zohar also recalls a_narration of two_angels in a_fallen_state, called aza and azael.
evil_angels are cast down from the_heaven after mistrusting adam for adam inclination towards sin.
once in earth, they complete the_enochian_narrative by teaching magic to humans and producing offspring with they, as well as consorting with lilith (hailed as "the_sinner").
in the_narrative, the_zohar affirms but simultaneously prohibits magical_practices.
as a_punishment, god puts the_angels in chains, but the_angels still copulate with the_demoness_naamah, who gives birth to demons, evil_spirits and witches.
christianity ==
luke 10:18 refers to "satan falling from heaven" and matthew 25:41 mentions "the_devil and luke 10:18_angels", who will be thrown into hell.
all_synoptic_gospels identify satan as the_leader of demons.
paul the_apostle (c. 5 – c. 64 or 67) states in 1_corinthians 6:3 that there are angels, who will be judged, implying the_existence of wicked_angels.
peter 2:4 and jude 1:6 refer paraenetically to angels who have sinned against god and await punishment on judgement_day.
the_book of revelation, chapter 12, speaks of satan as a_great_red_dragon whose_"tail swept a_third_part of the_stars of heaven and cast the_stars of heaven to the_earth".
in verses 7–9, satan is defeated in the_war in heaven against michael and michael angels: "
the_great_dragon was thrown down, that_ancient_serpent, who is called the devil and satan, the_deceiver of the_whole_world—michael was thrown down to the_earth, and his_angels were thrown down with michael".
nowhere within the_new_testament_writings, his_angels are identified with demons.
but by combining the_references to satan, demons and angels, early_christian_exegetes equated fallen_angels with demons, for which satan was regarded as the_leader.
origen and other_christian_writers linked the_fallen_morning_star of isaiah 14:12 of the_old_testament to jesus'_statement in luke 10:18 that jesus' "saw satan fall like lightning from heaven", as well as a passage about the_fall of satan in revelation 12:8–9.
the_latin_word lucifer, as introduced in the_late_4th-century_ad_vulgate, gave rise to the_name for a_fallen_angel.
christian_tradition has associated satan not only with the_image of the_morning_star in isaiah 14:12, but also with the_denouncing in ezekiel 28:11–19 of the_king of tyre, who is spoken of as having been a_"cherub".
the_church_fathers saw these_two_passages as in some_ways parallel, an_interpretation also testified in apocryphal and pseudepigraphic_works.
however, "no_modern_evangelical_commentary on isaiah or ezekiel sees isaiah 14 or ezekiel 28 as providing information about the_fall of satan".
early christianity ===
during the_period immediately before the_rise of christianity, the_intercourse between the_watchers and human_women was often seen as the_first_fall of the_angels.
early christianity === stuck to the_enochian_writings at least until the_third_century.
many_church_fathers such as irenaeus, justin_martyr, clement of alexandria and lactantius accepted the_association of the_angelic_descent_myth to the "sons of god" passage in genesis_6:1–4.
however, some_ascetics, such as origen (c. 184 – c. 253), rejected this_interpretation.
according to the_church_fathers who accepted the_doctrine by origen, these_angels were guilty of having transgressed the_limits of these_angels nature and of desiring to leave these_angels heavenly_abode to experience sensual_experiences.
irenaeus referred to fallen_angels as apostates, who will be punished by an_everlasting_fire.
justin_martyr (c. 100 – c. 165) identified pagan_deities as fallen_angels or pagan_deities demonic_offspring in disguise.
justin also held them responsible for christian_persecution during the_first_centuries.
tertullian and origen also referred to fallen_angels as teachers of astrology.
the_babylonian_king, who is described as a_fallen_"morning_star" in isaiah 14:1–17, was probably the_first_time identified with a_fallen_angel by origen.
this_description was interpreted typologically both as an_angel and a_human_king.
the_image of the_fallen_morning_star or angel was thereby applied to satan by early_christian_writers, following the_equation of lucifer to satan in the_pre-christian_century.
catholicism ===
by the_third_century, christians began to reject the_enochian_literature.
the_sons of god came to be identified merely with righteous_men, more precisely with descendants of seth who had been seduced by women descended from cain.
the_cause of evil was shifted from the_superior_powers of angels, to humans themselves, and to the_very_beginning of history; the_expulsion of satan and satan angels on the_one_hand and the_original_sin of humans on the_other_hand.
however, the_book of watchers, which identified the_sons of god with fallen_angels, was not rejected by syriac_christians.
augustine of hippo's_work
civitas_dei (5th_century) became the_major_opinion of western_demonology and for the_catholic_church.
civitas_dei (5th_century) rejected the_enochian_writings and stated that the_sole_origin of fallen_angels was the_rebellion of satan.
as a_result, fallen_angels came to be equated with demons and depicted as non-sexual_spiritual_entities.
the_exact_nature of their_spiritual_bodies became another_topic of dispute during the_middle_ages.
augustine based augustine descriptions of demons on augustine perception of the_greek_daimon.
the_greek_daimon was thought to be a_spiritual_being, composed of ethereal_matter, a_notion also used for fallen_angels by augustine.
however, fallen_angels by augustine received fallen_angels by augustine ethereal body only after fallen_angels by augustine fall.
later scholars tried to explain the_details of scholars_spiritual_nature, asserting that their_ethereal_body is a_mixture of fire and air, but that scholars are still composed of material_elements.
others denied any_physical_relation to material_elements, depicting the_fallen_angels as purely_spiritual_entities.
but even those who believed the_fallen_angels as purely_spiritual_entities had ethereal_bodies did not believe that even those who believed could produce any_offspring.
augustine, in augustine civitas dei describes two_cities (civitates) distinct from each other and opposed to each other like light and darkness.
the_earthly_city is caused by the_act of rebellion of the_fallen_angels as purely_spiritual_entities and is inhabited by wicked_men and demons (fallen_angels) led by satan.
on the_other_hand, the_earthly_city is inhabited by righteous_men and the_angels led by god.
although,   ontological_division into two_different_kingdoms shows resemblance of manichean_dualism, augustine differs in regard of the_origin and power of evil.
in augustine_works, evil originates from free_will.
augustine always emphasized the_sovereignty of god over the_fallen_angels.
accordingly, the_inhabitants of the_earthly_city can only operate within the_inhabitants of the_earthly_city god-given_framework.
the_rebellion of angels is also a_result of the_god-given_freedom of choice.
the_obedient_angels are endowed with grace, giving  the_obedient_angels a_deeper_understanding of god's_nature and the_order of the_cosmos.
illuminated by god-given_grace,  the_obedient_angels became incapable of feeling any_desire for sin.
the_obedient_angels, however, are not blessed with grace, thus  the_obedient_angels remain capable of sin.
after  the_obedient_angels decide to sin,  the_obedient_angels fall from heaven and become demons.
in augustine's_view of angels,  the_obedient_angels cannot be guilty of carnal_desires since  the_obedient_angels lack flesh, but  the_obedient_angels can be guilty of sins that are rooted in spirit and intellect such as pride and envy.
however, after they have made they decision to rebel against god, they cannot turn back.
the_catechism of the_catholic_church does not take "the_fall of the_angels" literally, but as a_radical_and_irrevocable_rejection of god and god reign by some_angels who, though created as good_beings, freely chose evil, their_sin being unforgivable because of the_irrevocable_character of their_choice, not because of any_defect in infinite_divine_mercy.
present-day_catholicism rejects apocatastasis, the_reconciliation with god suggested by the_church_father origen.
orthodox_christianity ===
eastern_orthodox_christianity ====
like catholicism, eastern_orthodox_christianity ==== shares the_basic_belief in fallen_angels as spiritual_beings who rebel against god.
unlike catholicism, however, there is no_established_doctrine about the_exact_nature of fallen_angels, but eastern_orthodox_christianity ====
unanimously agrees that the_power of fallen_angels is always inferior to god.
therefore, belief in fallen_angels can always be assimilated with local_lore, as long_belief in fallen_angels does not break basic_principles and is in line with the_bible.
historically, some_theologians even tend to suggest that fallen_angels could be rehabilitated in the_world to come.
fallen_angels, just like angels, play a_significant_role in the_spiritual_life of believers.
as in catholicism, fallen_angels tempt and incite people into sin, but mental_illness is also linked to fallen_angels.
those who have reached an_advanced_degree of spirituality are even thought to be able to envision those who have reached an_advanced_degree of spirituality.
rituals and sacraments performed by eastern_orthodoxy are thought to weaken such_demonic_influences.
ethiopian_church ====
unlike most_other_churches, ethiopian_church ==== accepts 1_enoch and the_book of jubilees as canonical.
as a_result, ethiopian_church ==== believes that human_sin does not originate in adam's_transgression alone, but also from satan and other_fallen_angels.
together with demons, together with demons continue to cause sin and corruption on earth.
protestantism ===
like catholicism, protestantism continues with the_concept of fallen_angels as spiritual_entities unrelated to flesh, but protestantism rejects the_angelology established by catholicism.
martin_luther's_(1483–1546)_sermons of the_angels merely recount the_exploits of the_fallen_angels, and does not deal with an_angelic_hierarchy.
satan and martin_luther fallen angels are responsible for some_misfortune in the_world, but martin_luther always believed that the_power of the_angels exceeds those of the_fallen_ones.
the_italian_protestant_theologian girolamo_zanchi (1516–1590) offered further_explanations for the_reason behind the_fall of the_angels.
according to zanchi, the_angels rebelled when the_incarnation of christ was revealed to the_angels in incomplete_form.
nevertheless, protestants are much less concerned with the_cause of angelic_fall, since it is thought as neither useful nor necessary to know.
the_concept of fallen_angels is debated in islam.
opposition to the_possibility of erring_angels can be attested as early as hasan of basra.
on the_other_hand abu_hanifa (d._767), founder of the_hanafi_school of jurisprudence, distinguished between obedient_angels, disobedient_angels and unbelievers among the_angels, who in turn differ from the_jinn and demons (shayatin).
the_quran mentions the_fall of iblis in several_surahs.
further, surah 2:102 implies that a_pair of fallen_angels introduces magic to humanity.
however, the_latter_angels did not accompany iblis.
the_latter_angels work in entirely_different_ways in the_quran and tafsir.
according to umm_al-kitab, azazil boasts about azazil being superior to god until azazil is thrown into lower_celestial_spheres and ends up on earth.
according to a_hadith_(tradition) mentioned in al-tha'alibis (961–1038)_qisas_al-anbiya, iblis commands iblis host of rebel_angels and the_fiercest_jinn from the_lowest_layer of hell.
in a_shia_narrative from ja'far_al-sadiq (700 or 702–765), idris (enoch) meets an_angel, which the_wrath of god falls upon, and idris (enoch) wings and hair are cut off; after idris prays for idris to god, idris are restored.
in return become friends and at his_request the_angel takes idris to the_heavens to meet the_angel.
some_recent_non-islamic_scholars suggest uzair, who is according to surah 9:30 called a son of god by jews, originally referred to a_fallen_angel.
while exegetes almost unanimously identified uzair as ezra, there is no_historical_evidence that the_jews called him son of god.
thus, the_quran may refer not to the_earthly_ezra, but to the_heavenly_ezra, identifying the_heavenly_ezra with the_heavenly_enoch, who in turn became identified with the_angel metatron (also called lesser yhwh) in merkabah_mysticism.
the_quran repeatedly tells about the_fall of iblis.
according to surah 2:30, the_angels object to god's_intention to create a_human, because the_angels will cause corruption and shed blood, echoing the_account of 1_enoch and the_book of jubilees.
this happens after the_angels observe men causing unrighteousness.
however, after god demonstrates the_superiority of adam's_knowledge in comparison to the_angels, god orders the_angels to prostrate the_angels.
only_iblis refuses to follow the_instruction.
when god asks for the_reason behind  only_iblis_refusal,  only_iblis boasts about  only_iblis being superior to adam, because  only_iblis is made of fire.
thereupon god expels  only_iblis from heaven.
in the_early_meccan_period,  only_iblis appears as a_degraded_angel.
but since  only_iblis is called a jinni in surah 18:50, some_scholars argue that  only_iblis is actually not an_angel, but an entity apart, stating  only_iblis is only allowed to join the_company of angels as a_reward for  only_iblis previous righteousness.
therefore, they reject the_concept of fallen_angels and emphasize the_nobility of angels by quoting certain_quranic_verses like 66:6 and 16:49, distinguishing between infallible_angels and jinn capable of sin.
however, the_notion of jinni cannot clearly exclude iblis from being an_angel.
according to ibn_abbas, angels who guard the_jinan (here:_heavens) are called jinni, just as humans who were from mecca are called mecci, but humans who were from mecca are not related to the_jinn-race.
other_scholars assert that a_jinn is everything hidden from human_eye, both_angels and other_invisible_creatures.
therefore, surah 18:50 could not exclude iblis from being an_angel.
in surah 15:36, god grants iblis'_request to prove the_unworthiness of humans.
surah 38:82 also confirms that iblis'_intrigues to lead humans astray are permitted by god's_power.
however, as mentioned in surah 17:65, iblis' attempts to mislead god's_servants are destined to fail.
the_quranic_episode of iblis' parallels another_wicked_angel in the_earlier_books of jubilees:
like iblis', mastema requests god's_permission to tempt humanity, and both are limited in both_power, that is, not able to deceive god's_servants.
however, the_motif of iblis'_disobedience derives not from the_watcher_mythology, but can be traced back to the_cave of treasures, a_work that probably holds the_standard_explanation in proto-orthodox_christianity for the_angelic_fall of satan.
according to the_standard_explanation in proto-orthodox_christianity for the_angelic_fall of satan, satan refuses to prostrate satan before adam, because satan is "fire and spirit" and thereupon satan is banished from heaven.
unlike the_majority_opinion in proto-orthodox_christianity, the_idea that iblis tries to usurp the_throne of god is alien to islam and due to the_throne of god strict_monotheism unthinkable.
harut and marut ===
harut and marut are a_pair of angels mentioned in surah_2:102_teaching_magic.
although the_reason behind  harut and marut stay on earth is not mentioned in the_quran, the_following_narration became canonized in islamic_tradition.
the quran exegete tabari attributed this_story to ibn_masud and ibn_abbas and is also attested by ahmad_ibn_hanbal.
briefly summarized, the_angels complain about the_mischievousness of mankind and make a_request to destroy the_angels.
consequently, god offers a_test to determine whether or not the_angels would do better than humans for long: the_angels are endowed with human-like_urges and satan has power over the_angels.
the_angels choose two (or in some_accounts three) among  the_angels.
however, on earth,  the_angels entertain and act upon sexual_desires and become guilty of idol_worship, whereupon  the_angels even kill an_innocent_witness of  the_angels actions.
for  the_angels_deeds,  the_angels are not allowed to ascend to heaven again.
probably the_names harut and marut are of zoroastrian_origin and derived from two_amesha_spentas called haurvatat and ameretat.
although the_quran gave these_fallen_angels iranian_names, mufassirs recognized these_fallen_angels iranian_names as from the_book of watchers.
in accordance with 3_enoch, al-kalbi (737 ad – 819_ad) named three_angels descending to earth, and
in accordance with 3_enoch, al-kalbi (737 ad – 819_ad) even gave
in accordance with 3_enoch, al-kalbi (737 ad – 819_ad)
in accordance with 3_enoch, al-kalbi (737 ad – 819_ad)
enochian_names.
in accordance with 3_enoch, al-kalbi (737 ad – 819_ad) explained that one of
in accordance with 3_enoch, al-kalbi (737 ad – 819_ad) returned to heaven and
the other two changed
in accordance with 3_enoch, al-kalbi (737 ad – 819_ad) names to harut and marut.
however, like in the_story of iblis, the_story of harut and marut does not contain any_trace of angelic_revolt.
rather, the_stories about fallen_angels are related to a_rivalry between humans and angels.
as the_quran affirms, harut and marut are sent by god and, unlike the_watchers, harut and marut only instruct humans to witchcraft by god's permission, just as iblis can just tempt humans by god's permission.
popular_culture ==
in the_divine_comedy (1308–1320) by dante_alighieri, fallen_angels guard the_city of dis surrounding the_lower_circles of hell.
fallen_angels mark a_transition: while in previous_circles, the_sinners are condemned for sins fallen_angels just could not resist, later on, the_lower_circles of hell are filled with sinners who deliberately rebel against god, such as fallen_angels or christian_heretics.
in john_milton's_17th-century_epic_poem paradise_lost, both_obedient_and_fallen_angels play an_important_role.
they appear as rational_individuals: they personality is similar to that of humans.
the_fallen_angels are named after entities from both_christian_and_pagan_mythology, such as moloch, chemosh, dagon, belial, beelzebub and satan himself.
following the_canonical_christian_narrative, satan himself convinces other_angels to live free from the_laws of god, thereupon other_angels are cast out of heaven.
the_epic_poem starts with the_fallen_angels in hell.
the_first_portrayal of god in the_book is given by fallen_angels, who describe him as a_questionable_tyrant and blame him for their_fall.
outcast from heaven, the_fallen_angels establish the_fallen_angels own kingdom in the_depths of hell, with a_capital called pandæmonium.
unlike most_earlier_christian_representations of hell, it is not the_primary_place for god to torture the_sinners, but the_fallen_angels own kingdom.
the_fallen_angels even build a_palace, play music and freely_debate.
nevertheless, without divine_guidance, the_fallen_angels turn hell into a_place of suffering.
the_idea of fallen_angels plays a_significant_role in the_various_poems of alfred_de_vigny.
in le_déluge (1823), the_son of an_angel and a_mortal_woman learns from the_stars about the_great_deluge.
in le_déluge (1823), the_son of an_angel and a_mortal_woman seeks refuge with
in le_déluge (1823), the_son of an_angel and a_mortal_woman beloved on mount_ararat, hoping that  in le_déluge (1823), the_son of an_angel and a_mortal_woman
angelic_father will save refuge.
but since  in le_déluge (1823), the_son of an_angel and a_mortal_woman does not appear, refuge are caught by the_flood.
éloa (1824) is about_a_female_angel created by the_tears of jesus.
éloa (1824) hears about a_male_angel, expelled from heaven, whereupon éloa (1824) seeks to comfort jesus, but goes to perdition as a_consequence.
