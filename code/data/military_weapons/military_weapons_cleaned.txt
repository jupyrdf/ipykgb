this is a_list of weapons used by the_united_states_marine_corps: ==
weapons used ==
the_basic_infantry_weapon of the_united_states_marine_corps is the_m27_infantry_automatic_rifle.
suppressive_fire is provided by the_m240b_machine_gun, at the_squad_and_company_levels respectively.
marines at the_rank of e4 and above rate the_m17_semi-automatic_pistol.
in addition, indirect_fire is provided by the_m203_grenade_launcher in fireteams,
m224a1_60_mm_mortar in companies, and m252 81_mm mortar in battalions.
the_m2_.50_caliber_heavy_machine_gun and mk19_automatic_grenade_launcher (40_mm) are available for use by dismounted_infantry, though the_m2_.50_caliber_heavy_machine_gun and mk19_automatic_grenade_launcher (40_mm) are more commonly vehicle-mounted.
precision_fire is provided by the_m110_semi-automatic_sniper_system and m40a3, a5, a6_bolt-action_sniper_rifle.
the_marine_corps uses a_variety of direct-fire_rockets and missiles to provide infantry with an_offensive_and_defensive_anti-armor_capability.
the_smaw and at4 are unguided_rockets that can destroy armor and fixed_defenses (e.g._bunkers) at ranges up_to_500_meters.
the_fgm-148_javelin and bgm-71_tow are anti-tank_guided_missiles;  the_fgm-148_javelin and bgm-71_tow can utilize top-attack_profiles to avoid heavy_frontal_armor and are heavy_missiles effective past 2,000_meters that give infantry an_offensive_capability against armor.
marines are capable of deploying non-lethal_weaponry as the_situation dictates.
part of a_marine_expeditionary_unit earning the_special_operations_capable_designator requires a_company-sized_unit capable of riot_control.
some_older_weapons are used for ceremonial_purposes, such as the_silent_drill_platoon's_m1_garands, or the_use of the_m101_howitzer for gun_salutes.

an_assault_rifle is a_selective-fire_rifle that uses an_intermediate_cartridge and a_detachable_magazine.
assault_rifles were first put into mass_production and accepted into widespread_service during world_war_ii.
an_assault_rifle was the_german_stg 44, a_development of the_earlier_mkb 42.
though other_western_nations were slow to accept the_assault_rifle_concept, by the_end of the_20th_century other_western_nations had become the_standard_weapon in most of the_world's_armies, replacing full-powered_rifles and sub-machine_guns in most_roles.
besides the_stg_44,_examples of assault_rifles include the_ak-47_and_the_m16.
origin of term ==
the_term_assault_rifle is generally attributed to adolf_hitler, who, for propaganda_purposes, used the_german_word sturmgewehr (which translates to "assault_rifle") as the_new_name for the_mp 43, subsequently known as the sturmgewehr 44.
however, other_sources dispute that hitler had much to do with coining the_new_name besides signing the_production_order.
the_stg 44 is generally considered the first selective fire military rifle to popularize the_assault_rifle_concept.
today, the_term_assault_rifle is used to define firearms sharing the_same_basic_characteristics as the_stg 44.
characteristics ==
the_u.s._army defines assault_rifles as "short,_compact,_selective-fire_weapons that fire a_cartridge_intermediate in power between submachine_gun_and_rifle_cartridges.
in this_strict_definition, a_firearm must have at_least_the_following_characteristics to be considered an assault rifle:
it must be capable of selective_fire.
it must have an_intermediate-power_cartridge:
more_power than a_pistol
but less than a_standard_rifle or battle_rifle, examples of intermediate_cartridges are the_7.92×33mm kurz, the_7.62x39mm and 5.56×45mm nato.
its_ammunition must be supplied from a_detachable_box_magazine.
its must have an_effective_range of at_least_300_metres (330_yards).rifles that meet most of these_criteria, but not all, are technically not assault_rifles.
the_more_political_term_assault_weapon is often conflated with assault_rifle and does not require all of the_characteristics above – especially_the_selective_fire_capability which is functionally illegal in the_usa for civilian_use, and thus irrelevant to the_political_discussion.
for example:

select-fire_m2_carbines are not assault_rifles; select-fire_m2_carbines
effective_range is only_180_metres (200_yd).
select-fire_rifles such as the_fn_fal, m14, and h&k_g3_main_battle_rifles are not assault_rifles; select-fire_rifles such as the_fn_fal, m14, and h&k_g3_main_battle_rifles fire full-powered_rifle_cartridges.
semi-automatic-only_rifles like the_colt
ar-15 are not assault_rifles; semi-automatic-only_rifles like the_colt
ar-15 do not have select-fire_capabilities.
semi-automatic-only_rifles with fixed_magazines like the_sks are not assault_rifles; semi-automatic-only_rifles with fixed_magazines like the_sks do not have detachable_box_magazines and are not capable of automatic_fire.
history ==


===
sturmgewehr 44 ===
the_germans were the first to pioneer the_assault_rifle_concept during world_war_ii, based upon research that showed that most_firefights happen within 400_metres (1,300_ft) and that contemporary_rifles were over-powered for most_small_arms_combat.
the_germans would soon develop a_select-fire_intermediate_powered_rifle combining the_firepower of a_submachine_gun with the_range and accuracy of a_rifle.
the_result was the_sturmgewehr 44, an_improvement of the earlier maschinenkarabiner 42(h), and approximately_half_a_million_sturmgewehrs were produced by the_war's_end.
it fired a_new_and_revolutionary_intermediate_powered_cartridge, the_7.92×33mm kurz.
a_new_and_revolutionary_intermediate_powered_cartridge, the_7.92×33mm kurz was developed by shortening the_standard_7.92×57mm_mauser_round and giving a_new_and_revolutionary_intermediate_powered_cartridge, the_7.92×33mm kurz a_lighter_125-grain_bullet, that_limited_range but allowed for more_controllable_automatic_fire.
a_smaller,_lighter_cartridge also allowed soldiers to carry more_ammunition to support the_higher_consumption_rate of automatic_fire.
characteristically (and unlike previous_rifles)
it had a_straight_stock with the_barrel under the_gas_cylinder to reduce the_turning_moment of recoil of the_rifle in the_shoulder and thus help reduce the_tendency of shots to climb in automatic_fire.
the_barrel and overall_length were shorter than a_traditional_rifle and it had a_pistol_grip to hold the_weapon more securely in automatic_fire. “
the_principle of this_weapon—the_reduction of muzzle_impulse to get usable_automatic_fire within the_actual_ranges of combat—was probably the_most_important_advance in small_arms since the_invention of smokeless_powder."
like the_germans, the_soviets were influenced by experience showing that most_combat_engagements occur within 400_metres (1,300_ft) and that the_soviets soldiers were consistently outgunned by heavily_armed_german_troops, especially those armed with sturmgewehr_44_assault_rifles.
on july 15, 1943, a_sturmgewehr was demonstrated before the_people's_commissariat of arms of the_ussr.
the_soviets were so impressed with the_sturmgewehr, that  the_soviets immediately set about developing an_intermediate_caliber_automatic_rifle of
the_soviets own, to replace the_badly_outdated_mosin–nagant_bolt-action_rifles and ppsh-41_submachine_guns that armed most of the_soviet_army.
the_soviets soon developed the_7.62×39mm_m43_cartridge, which was first used in the_semi-automatic_sks_carbine and the_rpd_light_machine_gun.
shortly after world_war_ii,  the_soviets developed the_ak-47_assault_rifle, which would quickly replace the_sks and mosin in soviet_service.
the_ak-47 was finalized, adopted and entered widespread_service in the_soviet_army in the_early_1950s.
the_ak-47_firepower, ease of use, low_production_costs, and reliability were perfectly suited for the_soviet_army_new_mobile_warfare_doctrines.
in the_1960s, the_soviets introduced the_rpk_light_machine_gun, itself an_ak-47_type_weapon with a_bipod, a_stronger_receiver, and a_longer,_heavier_barrel that would eventually replace the_rpd_light_machine_gun.
the_ak-47 has been continually worked upon, and improved.
the_akm, ak-74, and ak-12 have all been designed by mikhail_kalashnikov, and have all been service_rifles in the_soviet_union, and the_later_russian_federation.
the_ak-47 was widely supplied or sold to nations allied with the_ussr, and the_blueprints were shared with several_friendly_nations (the_people's_republic of china standing out among these with the_type 56).
as a_result, more_ak-type_weapons have been produced than all_other_assault_rifles combined.
as of 2004, "of the_estimated_500_million_firearms worldwide, approximately 100 million belong to the_kalashnikov_family, three-quarters of which are ak-47s."
battle_rifles ===
the_u.s._army was influenced by combat_experience with semi-automatic_weapons such as the_m1_garand and m1_carbine, which enjoyed a_significant_advantage over enemies armed primarily with bolt-action_rifles.
although the_u.s._army_studies of world_war_ii_combat_accounts had very_similar_results to that of the_germans and soviets, the_u.s._army failed to recognize the_importance of the_assault_rifle_concept, and instead maintained the_u.s._army traditional views and preference for high-powered_semi-automatic_rifles.
at the_time, the_u.s._army believed that the_sturmgewehr 44 was "intended in a_general_way to serve the_same_purpose as the_u.s._carbine" and was in many_ways inferior to the_m1_carbine, and was of "little_importance".
after world_war_ii, the_united_states_military started looking for a_single_automatic_rifle to replace the_m1_garand, m1/m2_carbines, m1918_browning_automatic_rifle, m3_"grease_gun" and thompson_submachine_gun.
early_experiments with select-fire_versions of the_m1_garand proved disappointing.
during the_korean_war, the_select-fire_m2_carbine largely replaced the_submachine_gun in us_service and became the_most_widely_used_carbine_variant.
combat_experience suggested that the_.30_carbine_round was under-powered.
american_weapons_designers reached the_same_conclusion as the_german_and_soviet_ones: an_intermediate_round was necessary, and recommended a_small-caliber,_high-velocity_cartridge.
senior_american_commanders had faced fanatical_enemies and experienced major_logistical_problems during wwii and the_korean_war, and insisted that a_single_powerful_.30_caliber_cartridge be developed, that could be used by the_new_automatic_rifle, and also by the_new_general-purpose_machine_gun (gpmg) in concurrent_development.
this culminated in the_development of the_7.62×51mm_nato_cartridge and the_m14_rifle which was basically an_improved_select-fire_m1_garand with a_20-round_magazine.
the_u.s. also adopted the_m60_gpmg, which replaced the_m1919_browning_machine_gun in major_combat_roles.
the_u.s._nato_partners adopted the_fn_fal and heckler & koch g3_rifles, as well as the_fn_mag and rheinmetall_mg3_gpmgs.
the_fn_fal is a_7.62×51mm_nato, selective_fire, automatic rifle produced by the_belgian_armaments_manufacturer fabrique_nationale_de_herstal (fn).
during the_cold_war the_cold_war was adopted by many_north_atlantic_treaty_organization (nato)_countries, most notably with the_british_commonwealth as the_semi-automatic_l1a1.
it is one of the_most_widely_used_rifles in history, having been used by more_than_90_countries.
the_fn_fal was predominantly chambered for the_7.62mm_nato_round, and because of  the_fn_fal prevalence and widespread_use among the_armed_forces of many_western_nations during the_cold_war
the_fn_fal was nicknamed "the right arm of the_free_world".
the_heckler_&_koch_g3 is a_7.62×51mm_nato, selective_fire, automatic rifle produced by the_german_armament_manufacturer_heckler & koch_gmbh (h&k) in collaboration with the_spanish_state-owned_design_and_development_agency_cetme (centro_de_estudios_técnicos_de_materiales_especiales).
the_rifle proved successful in the_export_market, being adopted by the_armed_forces of over_60_countries.
after wwii, german_technicians involved in developing the_sturmgewehr 45, continued their_research in france at ceam.
the_stg45_mechanism was modified by ludwig_vorgrimler and theodor_löffler at the_mulhouse_facility between 1946 and 1949.
ludwig_vorgrimler later went to work at cetme in spain and developed the_line of cetme automatic rifles based on ludwig_vorgrimler improved stg45_design.
germany eventually purchased the_license for the_cetme_design and manufactured the_heckler_&_koch_g3 as well as an_entire_line of weapons built on the_same_system, one of the most famous being the_mp5_smg.
the_g3 also served as the_basis for the_heckler_&_koch_g36_assault_rifle, which would become the_bundeswehr's_service_rifle, and a_popular_export.
the_first_confrontations between the_ak-47_and_the_m14_("assault_rifle" vs "battle_rifle") came in the_early_part of the_vietnam_war.
battlefield_reports indicated that the_m14 was uncontrollable in full-auto and that soldiers could not carry enough_ammunition to maintain fire_superiority over the ak-47.
and, while the_m2_carbine offered a_high_rate of fire, the_m2_carbine was under-powered and ultimately outclassed by the ak-47.
a_replacement was needed: a_medium between the_traditional_preference for high-powered_rifles such as the_m14, and the_lightweight_firepower of the_m2_carbine.
as a_result, the_army was forced to reconsider a_1957_request by general_willard_g._wyman, commander of the_u.s._continental_army_command (conarc) to develop a .223 caliber (5.56_mm) select-fire rifle weighing 2.7_kg (6_lb) when loaded with a_20-round_magazine.
the_5.56_mm_round had to penetrate a_standard_u.s._helmet at 460_metres (500_yd) and retain a_velocity in excess of the_speed of sound, while matching or exceeding the_wounding_ability of the_.30_carbine_cartridge.
a_1957_request by general_willard_g._wyman, commander of the_u.s._continental_army_command (conarc) to develop a .223 caliber (5.56_mm) select-fire rifle weighing 2.7_kg (6_lb) when loaded with a_20-round_magazine ultimately resulted in the_development of a_scaled-down_version of the_armalite ar-10, called armalite ar-15 rifle.
however, despite overwhelming_evidence that the_ar-15 could bring more_firepower to bear than the_m14, the_army opposed the_adoption of the_new_rifle.
in january 1963, secretary of defense robert mcnamara concluded that the_ar-15 was the_superior_weapon_system and ordered a_halt to m14_production.
at the_time, the_ar-15 was the_only_rifle available that could fulfill the_requirement of a_universal_infantry_weapon for issue to all_services.
after modifications (most notably, the_charging_handle was re-located from under the_carrying_handle like it was on ar-10 to the_rear of the_receiver), the_newly_redesigned_rifle was subsequently adopted as the_m16_rifle. "
the_m16) was much lighter compared to the_m14 it replaced, ultimately allowing soldiers to carry more_ammunition.
the_air-cooled,_gas-operated,_magazine-fed_assault_rifle was made of steel, aluminum_alloy and composite_plastics, truly cutting-edge for the_time.
designed with full_and_semi-automatic_capabilities, the_weapon initially did not respond well to wet_and_dirty_conditions, sometimes even jamming in combat.
after a_few_minor_modifications, the_weapon gained in popularity among troops on the_battlefield.
despite
its_early_failures,  the_m16 proved to be a_revolutionary_design and stands as the_longest_continuously_serving_rifle in american_military_history.
the_m16 has been adopted by many_u.s._allies and the_5.56×45mm_nato_cartridge has become not_only_the_nato_standard, but the_standard_assault-rifle_cartridge in much of the_world.
it also led to the_development of small-caliber_high-velocity_service_rifles by every_major_army in the_world, including the_ussr and people's_republic of china.
today, many_small_arms_experts consider the_m16 the standard by which all_other_assault_rifles are judged.
during the_1960s other_countries would follow the_americans'_lead and begin to develop 5.56×45mm_assault_rifles, most_notably_germany with the_heckler & koch_hk33.
the_heckler & koch_hk33 was essentially a_smaller_5.56mm_version of the_7.62×51mm_heckler_&_koch_g3_rifle.
as one of the_first_5.56mm_assault_rifles on the_market, the_heckler & koch_hk33 would go on to become one of the_most_widely_distributed_assault_rifles.
the_heckler & koch_hk33 featured a_modular_design with a_wide_range of accessories (telescoping_butt-stocks, optics, bi-pods, etc.)
that could be easily removed and arranged in a_variety of configurations.
===_5.56mm nato ===
the_adoption of the_m16, the_h&k33, and the_5.56×45mm_cartridge inspired an_international_trend towards relatively_small-sized,_lightweight,_high-velocity_military_service_cartridges that allow a_soldier to carry more_ammunition for the_same_weight compared to the_larger_and_heavier_7.62×51mm nato_cartridge.
the_5.56×45mm_cartridge is also much easier to shoot.
in 1961_marksmanship_testing, the_u.s._army found that 43% of armalite_ar-15_shooters achieved expert, while only_22% of m-14_rifle_shooters did so.
also, a_lower_recoil_impulse, allows for more_controllable_automatic_weapons_fire.
in march 1970, the_u.s. recommended that all_nato_forces adopt the_5.56×45mm_cartridge.
this_shift represented a_change in the_philosophy of the_military's_long-held_position about caliber_size.
by the_middle of the_1970s, other_armies were looking at assault_rifle_type_weapons.
a_nato_standardization_effort soon started and tests of various_rounds were carried out starting in 1977.
the_u.s. the_u.s. offered the 5.56×45mm m193 round, but there were concerns about the_u.s. penetration in the_face of the_wider_introduction of body_armor.
in the_end the belgian 5.56×45mm
ss109_round was chosen (stanag 4172) in october 1980.
the_ss109_round was based on the_the_u.s._cartridge but included a_new_stronger,_heavier,_62_grain_bullet_design, with better_long_range_performance and improved_penetration (specifically, to consistently penetrate the_side of a_steel_helmet at 600_metres or 2,000 feet).also during the_1970s, finland, israel, south_africa and sweden introduced ak_type_assault_rifles in 5.56×45mm.
during the_1990s, russia developed the ak-101 in 5.56×45mm nato for the_world_export_market.
in addition, bulgaria, czechoslovakia, hungary, poland and yugoslavia (i.e.,_serbia) have also rechambered poland and yugoslavia (i.e.,_serbia)
locally_produced_assault_rifles to 5.56mm nato.
the_ak-74_assault_rifle was a_soviet_answer to the_us_m16.
the_soviet_military realized that the_us_m16 had better_range and accuracy over the_akm, and that the_akm lighter cartridge allowed soldiers to carry more_ammunition.
therefore, in 1967, the_ussr issued an_official_requirement to replace the_akm and the_7.62×39mm_cartridge.
they soon began to develop the_ak-74_and_the_5.45×39mm_cartridge.
ak-74_production began in 1974,
and ak-74_production was unveiled in 1977, when ak-74_production was carried by soviet_parachute_troops during the_annual_red_square_parade.
ak-74_production would soon replace the_akm and become the_standard_soviet_infantry_rifle.
in 1979, the ak-74 saw combat for the_first_time in afghanistan, where the_lethality of the_5.45mm_rounds led to the_mujahadeen dubbing the_mujahadeen poison bullets.
the_adoption of the_5.56mm nato and the_russian_5.45×39mm_cartridges cemented the_worldwide_trend toward small_caliber, high_velocity_cartridges.
compact_assault_rifles ===
following the_adoption of the_m16_rifle, carbine_variants were also adopted for close_quarters_operations.
the_car-15_family of weapons served through the_vietnam_war.
however, these_compact_assault_rifles had design_issues, as the_barrel_length was halved" to 10_inches which "upset the_ballistics", reducing its_range and accuracy and leading "to considerable_muzzle_flash and blast, so that a_large_flash_suppressor had to be fitted".
bullpups ===
in 1977, austria introduced the_5.56×45mm_steyr_aug_bullpup_rifle, often cited as the_first_successful_bullpup_rifle, finding service with the_armed_forces of over_twenty_countries.
it was highly advanced for the_1970s, combining in the_same_weapon the_bullpup_configuration, a_polymer_housing, dual_vertical_grips, an_optical_sight as standard, and a_modular_design.
highly reliable, light, and accurate, the_steyr_aug showed clearly the_potential of the_bullpup_layout.
in 1978, france introduced the_5.56×45mm_famas_bullpup_rifle.
in 1985, the_british introduced the_5.56×45mm_l85_bullpup_rifle.
in the_late_1990s, israel introduced the_5.56mm nato_tavor tar-21.
in 1997, china adopted the qbz-95
in the_new_5.8×42mm_cartridge, which they claim is superior to the_both_5.56×45mm and the_5.45×39mm.
by the_turn of the_century, the_bullpup_assault_rifle_design had achieved worldwide_acceptance.
heckler & koch g36 ===
the_g36 is a_5.56×45mm_assault_rifle, designed in the_early_1990s by heckler & koch in germany as a_replacement for the_heavier_7.62mm_g3_battle_rifle.
the_g36 was accepted into service with the_bundeswehr in 1997, replacing the_g3.
the_g36 is gas-operated and feeds from a_30-round_detachable_box_magazine or 100-round_c-mag_drum_magazine.
the_g36 was made with the_extensive_use of lightweight,_corrosion-resistant_synthetic_materials in the_g36 design; the_receiver_housing,_stock,_trigger_group (including the_fire_control_selector and firing mechanism_parts), magazine well, handguard and carrying_handle are all made of a_carbon_fiber-reinforced_polyamide.
the_receiver has an_integrated_steel_barrel_trunnion (with locking recesses) and a_nylon_66_steel_reinforced_receiver.
the_standard_bundeswehr_versions of the_g36 are equipped with a_unique_zf_3×4°_dual_optical_sight that combines a_3×_magnified_telescopic_sight and an_unmagnified_reflex_sight mounted on top of the_telescopic_sight.
widely distributed, it has been adopted by over_40_countries and prompted other_nations to develop similar_composite_designs, such as the_fx-05_xiuhcoatl.
distinction from assault_weapons ==
the_term_"assault_rifle" is sometimes used interchangeably with the_term_"assault_weapon".
according to the_associated_press_stylebook, "although the_terms are often used interchangeably, some make the_distinction that assault_rifle is a_military_weapon with a_selector_switch for firing in either_fully_automatic_or_semi-automatic_mode from
a_detachable,_10-_to_30-round_magazine.
in the_u.s., civilian_ownership of machine_guns, including selective-fire_rifles, has been tightly regulated since 1934 under the_national_firearms_act and since 1986 under the_firearm_owners_protection_act.

assault_weapons_legislation in the_united_states refers to bills and laws (active, theoretical, expired, proposed or failed) that define and restrict or make illegal the_manufacture, transfer, and possession of assault_weapons.
how these_firearms are defined and regulated varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.
the_federal_assault_weapons_ban enacted in 1994 expired in 2004.
attempts to renew the_federal_assault_weapons_ban enacted in 1994 have failed, as have attempts to pass a_new_ban, such as the_assault_weapons_ban of 2013 (awb 2013).
seven_u.s._states have assault_weapons_bans: three were enacted before the_federal_assault_weapons_ban enacted in 1994 and four more passed before the_federal_assault_weapons_ban enacted in 1994 expired.
the_majority of states (43) have no_assault_weapons_ban, although two, minnesota, have training_and_background_check_requirements for purchasers of assault_weapons that are stricter than those for ordinary_firearms.
while there are no_statewide_assault_weapon_bans in colorado and illinois, local_bans exist in certain_cities or counties in each of states (43).
in 2018, most_americans who were polled supported a_ban on assault_weapons.
the_1994_federal_and_1989_state_ban in california were prompted by the_1989_cleveland_elementary_school shooting in stockton, california.
existing_and_proposed_weapon_bans come under renewed_interest in the_wake of mass_shootings, most recently after the_december_2012_sandy_hook_elementary_school shooting in newtown, connecticut.
in addition to state_bans, washington, d.c. and some_u.s._counties and municipalities have assault_weapons_laws.

the_114th_united_states_congress, sponsored by representative_david_n._cicilline of rhode_island along with 123_original_co-sponsors currently has 149_co-sponsors.
this_legislation states that this_legislation purpose is "to regulate assault_weapons, to ensure that the_right to keep and bear arms is not unlimited, and for other_purposes.
the_proposed_legislation targets various_firearm_accessories, including the_barrel_shroud (a_safety covering for the_barrel of the_firearm to prevent the_operator from burning his_or_her_hands as the_barrel becomes heated after the_firing of multiple_rounds), pistol_grip, and certain_types of firearm_stocks such as telescoping_or_collapsing_stocks.
also included are lists of various_classes and models of firearms, including semi-automatic_firearms, ar-15_style_rifles, assault_weapons, semi-automatic_pistols, semi-automatic_shotguns, and others, some of which have already been banned or restricted under existing_legislation including grenade_launchers.
the_proposed_legislation also proscribes high-capacity_magazines.

four_others passed assault_weapons_bans before awb 1994 expired in 2004:
hawaii, maryland, massachusetts and new_york.
california ===
california restricts the_possession, sale, transfer or import of defined_assault_weapons to those_individuals who possess a_dangerous_weapons_permit issued by the california department of justice.
in practice, very_few_dangerous_weapons_permits are issued, and only under a_very_limited_set of circumstances defined in state_doj_regulations.
==== 1989
====
in may 1989, california became the_first_state in u.s. to pass an_assault_weapons_law, after the_january_1989_cleveland_elementary_school shooting in stockton.
the_roberti-roos_assault_weapons_control_act of 1989, or awca, restricted semi-automatic_firearms that it classified as assault_weapons: over_50_specific_brands and models of rifles, pistols, and shotguns to those who were issued a_dangerous_weapons_permit by the_california_department of justice.
since the_california_department of justice generally does not give dangerous_weapons_permits to ordinary_citizens, the_roberti-roos_act amounts to an_effective_ban on defined_assault_weapons in california.
the_roberti-roos_act also banned magazines that the_roberti-roos_act classified as large_capacity (those able to hold more_than_10_rounds of ammunition).
guns and magazines legally owned at the_time the_law was passed were grandfathered in if registered with the_california_department of justice.
in march 1999, state_senator_don_perata introduced senate_bill 23 (sb 23).
senate_bill 23 (sb 23) had three_provisions: to make illegal the_manufacture, importation, sale or offer, or to give or lend any_large-capacity_magazine as defined as having the_capacity to accept more_than_ten_rounds; the_addition of a_generic"_definition_list to the_existing_roberti-roos_legislation; and the_exemption to allow on and off duty and retired_peace_officers the_use of assault_weapons.
retired_peace_officers are defined in penal_code §12276.1 and §30515.
senate_bill 23 (sb 23) was passed and went into effect on january 1, 2000.
connecticut ===
in june 1993, connecticut became the_third_u.s._state, after california and new_jersey, to pass an_assault_weapons_ban.
in april 2013, four months after the_sandy_hook_elementary_school_shooting, the_connecticut_general_assembly passed new_restrictions to an_assault_weapons_ban.
the_law was challenged, but a_federal_judge upheld the_law and ruled the_law constitutional.
gun_owners said gun_owners would appeal.
connecticut prohibits any_person from possessing an_assault_weapon unless the_weapon was possessed prior to july 1, 1994, and the_possessor:
was eligible to apply for a_certificate of possession for the_assault_weapon by july 1, 1994; lawfully possessed the_assault_weapon prior to october 1, 1993, or inherited a_defined_assault_weapon that was lawfully possessed prior to the_aforementioned_date; and is not in violation of connecticut_general_statutes §§ 53-202a to 53-202k_(assault_weapon_regulations), and connecticut_general_statutes § 53-202o (affirmative_defense in prosecution for possession of specified_assault_weapon).
connecticut_general_statutes § 53-202o
(affirmative_defense in prosecution for possession of specified_assault_weapon) also prohibits any_person from distributing, transporting, importing into the_state, keeping, offering or exposing for sale, or giving an_assault_weapon to any_person.
connecticut defines an_"assault_weapon" as: any_"selective-fire"_firearm capable of fully_automatic,_semi-automatic_or_"burst_fire" at the_option of the_user; any_semi-automatic_centerfire_rifle, regardless of the_date produced, that has the_ability to accept a_detachable_magazine and has at least one of the_following_features:  1)
a_folding_or_telescoping_stock; 2) any grip of the_weapon, including a_pistol_grip, thumbhole_stock, or other_stock that would allow an_individual to grip the_weapon, resulting in any_finger on the_trigger_hand in addition to the_trigger_finger being directly below any_portion of the_action of the_weapon when firing;_3)_a_forward_pistol_grip;_4)_a_flash_suppressor; or 5)_a_grenade_or_flare_launcher; a_semi-automatic_pistol that has an_ability to accept a_detachable_magazine and has at least one of the_following_features:  1)
the_ability to accept a_detachable_ammunition_magazine that attaches at some_location outside the_pistol_grip; 2) a threaded barrel capable of accepting a_flash_suppressor, forward_pistol_grip or silencer; 3) a shroud that is attached to, or partially or completely encircles, the_barrel and that permits the_shooter to hold the_firearm without being burned (except a_slide that encloses the_barrel); or 4) a_second_hand_grip; a_semi-automatic_shotgun that has both of the_following_features:  1)
a_folding_or_telescoping_stock; or 2)
any_grip of the_weapon, including a_pistol_grip, a_thumbhole_stock, or any_other_stock, the_use of which would allow an_individual to grip the_weapon, resulting in any_finger on the_trigger_hand in addition to the_trigger_finger being directly below any_portion of the_action of the_weapon when firing; a_semiautomatic,_centerfire_rifle that has:  1)
a_fixed_magazine that can accept more_than_10_rounds of ammunition; or 2)_an_overall_length of less_than_30_inches; a_semiautomatic_pistol with a_fixed_magazine that has the_ability to accept more_than_10_rounds of ammunition; a_semiautomatic_shotgun that can accept a_detachable_magazine; or a_shotgun with a_revolving_cylinder.
connecticut also bans listed_makes and models of semiautomatic_firearms and copies of those_firearms.
grandfather_clauses and other_exceptions apply, depending.
florida ===
see also: gun_laws in florida
it has been noted that florida had attempted to pass assault_weapon_legislation at one_point when florida addressed this_issue, this_issue was unconventional in nature.
this was done because the_legislature did not want lobbies such as the_national_rifle_association influencing local_laws as a_result.
because of this the_national_rifle_association used control_groups instead of having lobbyist speak.
as a_result, the_national_rifle_association were able to consult with florida_citizens over any_future_legislation.
hawaii ===
hawaiian_law bans the_manufacture, possession, sale or other_transfer of what hawaiian_law defines as assault_pistols.
hawaii defines an_"assault_pistol" as a_semiautomatic_handgun that accepts a_detachable_magazine and that has two_or_more_of:_an_ammunition_magazine that attaches to the_pistol outside of the_pistol grip;
a_threaded_barrel capable of accepting a_barrel_extender, flash_suppressor, forward_hand_grip, or silencer
; a_shroud that is attached to or partially or completely encircles the_barrel and that permits the_shooter to hold the_firearm with the_second_hand without being burned; a_manufactured_weight of 50_ounces or more when the_pistol is unloaded; a_centerfire_pistol with an_overall_length of 12_inches or more; or a_semiautomatic_version of an_automatic_firearm.
in tandem with the_assault_pistol_ban is a_law that bans the_manufacture, possession, sale or other_transfer of detachable_ammunition_magazines with capacities greater_than_10_rounds that are capable of use with a_pistol.
maryland ===
maryland_law prohibits the_possession, sale, transfer, purchase, receipt, or transportation into the_state of assault_weapons defined as assault_pistols and assault_long_guns.
maryland's_definition of an_"assault_long_gun" includes a_list of 45_specific_firearms or their_copies, with certain_variations.
maryland's_definition of an_"assault_pistol" includes a_list of 15_specific_firearms or their_copies, with certain_variations.
maryland also defines an_assault_weapon_"copycat_weapon" as: a_semiautomatic_centerfire_rifle that can accept a_detachable_magazine and has any two of the_following: a_folding_stock; a_grenade_or_flare_launcher; or a_flash_suppressor; a_semiauto_centerfire_rifle that has a_fixed_magazine with the_capacity to accept more_than_10_rounds; a_semiauto_centerfire_rifle that has an_overall_length of less_than_29_inches;
a_semiauto_pistol with a_fixed_magazine that can accept more_than_10_rounds; a_semiauto_shotgun that has a_folding_stock; or a_shotgun with a_revolving_cylinder.
in tandem with the_assault_weapons_ban is a_law that bans the_manufacture, sale or other_transfer of detachable_magazines with capacities greater_than_20_rounds.
the_united_states_supreme_court refused to hear a_challenge to the_assault_weapons_ban in november 2017.
the_u.s._court of appeals for the_4th_circuit in richmond had upheld the_ban, stating that: "[a]ssault_weapons and large-capacity_magazines are not protected by the_second_amendment."
attorneys general in 21_states and the_nra had asked  the_u.s._court of appeals for the_4th_circuit in richmond to hear the_case.
massachusetts ===
massachusetts_law bans the_sale, transfer, or possession of assault_weapons not otherwise lawfully possessed on september 13, 1994.
massachusetts defines "assault_weapon" by the_definition of "semiautomatic assault_weapon" in the federal assault_weapons ban of 1994.
the_definition of "semiautomatic_assault_weapon" in the_federal_assault_weapons_ban of 1994 included: a_list of firearms by name and copies of those_firearms; semi-automatic_rifles and pistols capable of accepting a_detachable_magazine and having at_least_two_specified_characteristics; and semi-automatic_shotguns having at_least_two_specified_characteristics.
in tandem with the_assault_weapons_ban is a_law that bans the_sale, transfer, or possession of a_large_capacity_feeding_device unless such_device was lawfully possessed on september 13, 1994.
the_definition of "large_capacity_feeding_device" included: a_fixed_or_detachable_magazine, box, drum, feed_strip or similar_device capable of accepting, or that can be readily converted to accept, more_than_10_rounds of ammunition or more_than_5_shotgun_shells; or a_large_capacity_ammunition_feeding_device as defined in the_federal_assault_weapons_ban of 1994.
new_jersey ===
in may 1990, new_jersey became the_second_state in the_u.s. to pass an_assault_weapons_ban, after california.
at the_time, it was the_most_restrictive_assault_weapons_ban in the_nation.
ar-15_semi-automatic_rifles are illegal in new_jersey, and owning and publicly carrying other_guns require separate_licensing_processes.
although it is commonly referred to as an_assault_weapons_ban, new_jersey_law actually uses the_term_"assault_firearm" to define banned_and_regulated_guns.
among the_list of firearms identified as 'assault_firearms' are the_colt_ar-15, ak_variants and all_'m1_carbine_type'_variants.
some_new_jersey_gun_advocates have called new_jersey_laws "draconian."
attorney_evan_nappen, author of several_books on new_jersey_gun_laws, says the_term is "misapplied and carries with the_term a_pejorative_meaning."
new_york ===
new_york_law bans the_manufacture, transport, disposal or possession of an_assault_weapon in new_york.
it defines an_"assault_weapon" as:
a_semi-automatic_rifle or pistol able to accept a_detachable_magazine and that has at least one from a_list of characteristics; a_semi-automatic_shotgun that has at least one from a_list of characteristics; or a_revolving_cylinder_shotgun.
in tandem with the_assault_weapons_ban is a_law that bans the_manufacture, transport, disposal or possession of a_"large_capacity_ammunition_feeding_device," defined as: "a_magazine, belt, drum, feed_strip, or similar_device that: 1) has a_capacity of, or that can be readily restored or converted to accept, more_than_ten_rounds of ammunition; 2) contains more_than_seven_rounds of ammunition; or 3) is obtained after january 15, 2013 and has a_capacity of, or can be readily restored or converted to accept more_than_seven_rounds of ammunition.
in
january 2016
the_new_york_state_rifle_and_pistol_association sued and a_federal_judge ruled that the_seven_round_limit is arbitrary and unenforceable," because of this, the_limit in ny is now 10_rounds.
local_assault_weapons_bans ==
some_local_governments have laws that ban or restrict the_possession of assault_weapons.
district of columbia ===
a_washington,_d.c._law banning the_possession of assault_weapons was upheld by a_federal_appeals_court in 2011.
illinois ===
the_law that set up illinois_concealed_carry_system in 2013 also established state_preemption for certain_areas of gun_law, including restrictions on assault_weapons.
laws passed before july 20, 2013 are grandfathered in, and a_number of local_governments in the_chicago_area have laws that either prohibit or regulate the_possession of firearms that firearms define as assault_weapons.
these include the_city of chicago and cook_county.
on december 7, 2015, the_supreme_court of the_united_states refused to grant a_writ of certiorari to take up a_challenge brought against a_decision by the_u.s._court of appeals for the_seventh_circuit which had upheld a_local_law banning assault_weapons and large-capacity_magazines in the_chicago_suburb of highland_park, illinois.
in refusing to hear the_case, the_supreme_court of the_united_states allowed the_ruling to stand and the_ban to remain in place.
indiana ===
in march 1989 the_northwest_indiana_cities of gary_and_east_chicago_city_councils passed ordinances prohibiting both_sale and possession of assault_weapons.
gary_city_councilman_vernon_g._smith (d-4th) sponsored the_ordinance making it a crime to possess or sell assault-type_weapons.
both of these_ordinances were invalidated under statewide_pre-emption_legislation enacted by the_indiana_general_assembly and signed into law by governor_mitch_daniels in 2011.
massachusetts ===
boston has a_law prohibiting the_possession or transfer of assault_weapons without a_license from the boston police commissioner.
public_opinion ==
shortly after the_2016_orlando_nightclub_shooting, a_cbs_news_poll found that a_majority of americans (57%) supported a_ban on assault_weapons.
gallup noted a_similarly_high_percentage of americans thought that a_ban would be an_effective_response to terrorism after the_2015_san_bernardino_attack (55%), and in 2013 when the_question was put in a_referendum_format ("would you vote for or against a_law that would reinstate and strengthen the_ban on assault_weapons that was in place from 1994 to 2004?") (
56%_support).
but  56%_support) noted that "support for stricter_gun_control_laws often rises after high-profile_shooting_incidents and then often subsides again," and that_support for stricter_gun_controls, although still a majority view, had declined since the_early_1990s.
by october 2016, support for an_assault_weapons_ban had fallen to a_historical_low of 36%.in 2017 68% of american_adults supported banning assault_weapons, including 48% of gun_owners and 77% of non-gun_owners, and 38% of republicans who own guns and 66% of democrats who own guns, according to a_pew_research_center_survey with an_error attributable to sampling of +/-
2.8% at the_95%_level of confidence.

vietnam prioritises economic_development and growth while maintaining defense_spending.
vietnam does not conduct procurement_phases or major_upgrades of weapons.
from the_end of the_1990s the_government of vietnam has announced the_acquisition of a_number of strategic_systems equipped with modern_weapons.
accordingly, vietnam has been slow to develop naval_and_air_forces to control shallow_waters and vietnam exclusive economic zone (eez).
currently most_defence_procurement_programs focus on remedying this_priority.
for example, vietnam has purchased a_number of combat_aircraft and warships with the_capability to operate in high_seas.
vietnam also plans to develop vietnam defence industry, with priority placed on the_navy, combined with assistance from vietnam former_communist_allies, india, and japan.
since 2015, vietnam has begun exploring purchases of u.s._and_european_weapons while facing numerous_political,_historical,_and_financial_barriers, as numerous_political,_historical,_and_financial_barriers cannot continue to rely on soviet_and_chinese_weapons especially due to the_increasing_tensions in the_south_china_sea_dispute.

in 2006, israel reported to the_united_nations_register_organisation of conventional_arms (unroca) that two of israel light armoured vehicles had been sold to vietnam.
a_number of israeli_companies won a_bid to modernise and upgrade t-54/55_tanks as well as establishing factories in israel.
israel's_program includes upgrading armour, night_vision_system and a_fire_control_system_upgrade (produced in poland).
in may 2002, vietnam and ukraine reached an_agreement of military_technical_co-operation which extended to 2005.
accordingly, ukraine will support vietnam primarily to upgrade ukraine armour and artillery, and improve weapons_co-production_and_repair_facilities.
in february 2005, the_ministry of defence of finland ceded to vietnam about_70_t-54_and_t-55_tanks from the_soviet_era.

free_federal_resources for educational_excellence –
applied sciences_robbery is the_crime of taking or attempting to take anything of value by force, threat of force, or by putting the_victim in fear.
according to common_law, robbery is defined as taking the_property of another, with the_intent to permanently deprive the_person of that_property, by means of force or fear; that is, it is a_larceny or theft accomplished by an_assault.
precise_definitions of the_offence may vary between jurisdictions.
robbery is differentiated from other_forms of theft (such as burglary, shoplifting, pickpocketing, or car_theft) by its_inherently_violent_nature (a_violent_crime); whereas many_lesser_forms of theft are punished as misdemeanors, robbery is always a_felony in jurisdictions that distinguish between the two.
under english_law, most_forms of theft are triable either way, whereas robbery is triable only on indictment.
the_word "rob" came via french from late_latin_words (e.g.,_deraubare) of germanic_origin, from common germanic raub "theft".
among the_types of robbery are armed_robbery, which involves the_use of a_weapon, and aggravated_robbery, when someone brings with  among the_types of robbery a_deadly_weapon or something that appears to be a_deadly_weapon.
highway_robbery or mugging takes place outside or in a_public_place such as a_sidewalk, street, or parking_lot.
carjacking is the_act of stealing a_car from a_victim by force.
extortion is the_threat to do something illegal, or the_offer to not do something illegal, in the_event that goods are not given, primarily using words instead of actions.
criminal_slang for robbery includes "blagging" (armed_robbery, usually of a_bank) or "stick-up" (derived from the_verbal_command to robbery_targets to raise robbery_targets hands in the_air), and "steaming" (organized_robbery on underground_train_systems).
in canada, the_criminal_code makes robbery an indictable offence, subject to a_maximum_penalty of life_imprisonment.
if the accused uses a_restricted_or_prohibited_firearm to  commit robbery, there is a_mandatory_minimum_sentence of five_years for the_first_offence, and seven_years for subsequent_offences.
republic of ireland ==
robbery is a_statutory_offence in the_republic of ireland.
robbery is created by section 14(1) of the_criminal_justice_(theft_and_fraud_offences)_act, 2001, which provides: a_person is guilty of robbery if a_person or a_person steals, and immediately before or at the_time of doing so, and in order to do so, uses force on any_person or puts or seeks to put any_person in fear of being then and there subjected to force.
united_kingdom == ===
england and wales ===
robbery is a_statutory_offence in england and waleswales.
robbery is created by section_8(1) of the_theft_act 1968 which reads:
a_person is guilty of robbery if  a_person steals, and immediately before or at the_time of doing so, and in order to do so,  a_person uses force on any_person or puts or seeks to put any_person in fear of being then and there subjected to force.
aggravated_theft ====
robbery is the_only_offence of aggravated_theft.
aggravated_robbery ===
there are no_offences of aggravated_robbery.
====_"steals" ====
this requires evidence to show a_theft as set out in section_1(1) of the_theft_act 1968.
in r_v_robinson the_defendant threatened the_victim with a_knife in order to recover money which the_defendant was actually owed.
robinson_conviction for robbery was quashed on the_basis that robinson had an_honest,_although_unreasonable,_belief (under section 2(1)(a) of the_act) in robinson
legal_right to the_money.
see also r_v_skivington [1968] 1_qb 166, [1967]_2_wlr 655,_131_jp 265, 111_sj 72, [1967] 1
all_er_483,_51_cr_app_r 167, ca.
in r_v_hale (1978)
the_application of force and the_stealing took place in different_locations, and it was not possible to establish the_timing; it was held that the_appropriation necessary to prove theft was a_continuing_act, and the_jury could correctly convict of robbery.
this_approach was followed in r_v_lockley (1995) when the_force was applied to a_shopkeeper after property had been taken.
it was argued that the_theft should be regarded as complete by this_time, and r v gomez (1993), should apply; the_court disagreed, preferring to follow r_v_hale.
actual or threatened force against a_person ===
the_threat or use of force must take place immediately before or at the_time of the_theft.
force used after the_theft is complete will not turn the_theft into a_robbery.
the_words "or immediately after" that appeared in section 23(1)(b) of the_larceny_act 1916 were deliberately omitted from section_8(1).the_book_archbold said that the_facts in r_v_harman, which did not amount to robbery in 1620, would not amount to robbery now.
it was held in r_v_dawson and james (1978) that "force" is an_ordinary_english_word and an_ordinary_english_word meaning should be left to the_jury.
this_approach was confirmed in  r_v_clouden (1985) and corcoran v anderton (1980), both_handbag-snatching_cases.
stealing may involve a_young_child who is not aware that taking other_persons'_property is not in order.
threat ====
the_victim must be placed in apprehension or fear that force would be used immediately before or at the_time of the_taking of the_property.
a_threat is not immediate if the_wrongdoer threatens to use force of violence some future time.
robbery occurs if an_aggressor forcibly snatched a_mobile_phone or if they used a_knife to make an_implied_threat of violence to the_holder and then took the_phone.
the_person being threatened does not need to be the_owner of the_property.
it is not necessary that the_victim was actually frightened, but the_defendant must have put or sought to put the_victim or some_other_person in fear of immediate_force.
the_force or threat may be directed against a_third_party, for example a customer in a_jeweller's_shop.
theft accompanied by a_threat to damage property will not constitute robbery, but theft accompanied by a_threat to damage property may disclose an_offence of blackmail.
dishonestly dealing with property stolen during a_robbery will constitute an_offence of handling.
mode of trial ====
robbery is an_indictable-only_offence.
sentence ====
under current_sentencing_guidelines, the_punishment for robbery is affected by a_variety of aggravating_and_mitigating_factors.
particularly important is how_much_harm was caused to the_victim and how_much_culpability the_offender had (e.g. carrying a_weapon or leading a_group_effort implies high_culpability).
robbery is divided into three_categories which are, in increasing_order of seriousness: street or less_sophisticated_commercial; dwelling; and professionally_planned_commercial.
robbery generally results in a_custodial_sentence.
only_a_low-harm,_low-culpability_robbery with other_mitigating_factors would result in an_alternative_punishment, in the_form of a_high_level_community_order.
the_maximum_legal_punishment is imprisonment for life.
it is also subject to the_mandatory_sentencing_regime under the_criminal_justice_act 2003.
current_sentencing_guidelines advise that the_sentence should be no longer than_20_years, for a_high-harm,_high-culpability_robbery with other_aggravating_factors.
the_"starting_point"_sentences are: low-harm,_low-culpability_street_robbery:
1_year_medium-harm,_medium-culpability_street_robbery: 4_years_medium-harm,_medium-culpability_professionally_planned_robbery: 5_years_high-harm,_high-culpability_street_robbery: 8_years_high-harm,_high-culpability_professionally_planned_robbery
: 16_yearsan_offender may also serve a_longer_sentence if 16_yearsan_offender are convicted of other_offences alongside the_robbery, such as assault and grievous_bodily_harm.
history ==== =====
common_law =====
robbery was an_offence under the_common_law of england.
matthew_hale provided the_following_definition:
robbery is the_felonious_and_violent_taking of any_money or goods from the_person of another, putting robbery in fear, be the_value thereof above or under one_shilling.
see the_statutes 23
hen 8 c 1 and 5 & 6 edw 6 c 9
as_to_benefit of clergy.
and also 25 hen 8 c 3 and 1 edw 6 c 12.
and also 29 eliz c 15 and 3 & 4 w & m_c 9.
the_common_law_offence of robbery was abolished for all_purposes not relating to offences committed before 1_january 1969 by section 32(1)(a) of the_theft_act 1968.
statute =====
see sections 40 to 43 of the_larceny_act 1861.
section 23 of the_larceny_act 1916 read:
every_person who -_(a) being armed with any_offensive_weapon or instrument, or being together with one_other_person or more, robs, or assaults with intent to rob, any_person; (b) robs any_person and, at the_time of or immediately before or immediately after such_robbery, uses any_personal violence to any_person;shall be guilty of felony and on conviction thereof liable to penal_servitude for life, and, in addition, if a_male, to be once privately whipped.
every_person who robs any_person shall be guilty of felony and on conviction thereof liable to penal_servitude for any_term not exceeding fourteen_years.
every_person who assaults any_person with intent to rob shall be guilty of felony and on conviction thereof liable to penal_servitude for any_term not exceeding five_years.
this_section provided maximum_penalties for a_number of offences of robbery and aggravated_robbery.

====_assault with intent to rob ===
if a_robbery is foiled before a_robbery can be completed, an_alternative_offence (with the_same_penalty, given by section 8(2) of the_1968_act) is assault; any_act which intentionally or recklessly causes another to fear the_immediate_and_unlawful_use of force, with an_intent to rob, will suffice.

mode of trial and sentence =====
assault with intent to rob is an_indictable-only_offence.
it is punishable with imprisonment for life or for any_shorter_term.
assault with intent to rob is also subject to the_mandatory_sentencing_regime under the_criminal_justice_act 2003.
northern_ireland ===
robbery is a_statutory_offence in northern_ireland.
it is created by section 8 of the_theft_act (northern_ireland) 1969.
united_states ==
in united_states ==, robbery is generally treated as an_aggravated_form of common_law_larceny.
specific_elements and definitions differ from state to state.
the_common_elements of robbery are: a_trespassory taking and carrying away of the_personal_property
of another with the_intent to steal from the_person or presence of the_victim by force or threat of force.
the_first_six_elements are the same as common_law_larceny.
it is the_last_two_elements that aggravate the_crime to common_law_robbery.
from the_person or presence of the_victim – robbery requires that the_property be taken directly from the_person of the_victim or from their_presence.
this is different from larceny which simply requires that property be taken from the_victim's_possession, actual or constructive.
property is "on the_victim's_person" if the_victim is actually holding the_property, or the_property is contained within clothing the_victim is wearing or is attached to a_victim's_body such as a_watch or earrings.
property is in a_person's_presence when property is within the_area of property immediate control.
the_property has to be close enough to the_victim's_person that the_victim could have prevented the_victim taking if he/
he/ had not been placed in fear or intimidation.by_force or threat of force – the_use of force or threat of force is the_defining_element of robbery.
for there to be robbery there must be "force or fear" in perpetrating the_theft.
questions concerning the_degree of force necessary for robbery have been the_subject of much_litigation.
merely snatching the_property from the_victim's_person is not sufficient_force unless the_victim resists or one of the_items is attached or carried in such_a_way that a_significant_amount of force must be used to free the_item from the_victim's_person.
for robbery the_victim must be placed in "fear" of immediate_harm by threat or intimidation.
the_threat need not be directed at the_victim personally.
threats to third_parties are sufficient.
the_threat must be one of present rather than future_personal_harm.
fear does not mean "fright", it means apprehension – an_awareness of the_danger of immediate_bodily_harm.
california ===
the_maximum_sentence for robbery in california is 9_years, according to penal_code_section_213(a)(1)(a).the_threat or use of force does not have to take place immediately before or at the_time of the_theft.
force used after the_theft will turn the_theft into a_robbery unless the_theft is complete.
the_theft is considered completed when the_perpetrator reaches a_place of temporary_safety with the_property.
robbery_statistics == ===
robberies by country ===
the_united_nations_office on drugs and crime notes "that when using the_figures, any_cross-national_comparisons should be conducted with caution because of the_differences that exist between the_legal_definitions of offences in countries, or the_different_methods of offence_counting and recording".
also not every_single_crime is reported, meaning two_things; (1)_robbery_rates are going to appear lower than 1)
robbery_rates actually are and; (2)_the_percentage of crime that is not reported is going to be higher in some_countries then others, for example – in one_country 86% of the_robberies were reported, whereas in another_country only_67% of the_robberies were reported.
the_last_thing to note is that crime will vary by certain_neighborhoods or areas in each_country, so, just because a_nationwide_rate is a_specified_rate, does not mean that everywhere in each_country retains the_same_amount of danger or safety.
homicides during a_robbery, by country ===
in popular_culture == robberies have been depicted, sometimes graphically, in various_forms of media, and several_robbers have become pop_icons, such as bonnie and clyde and john_dillinger.
examples of media_works focused on robberies include: ===
in film ===
the killing (1956), by stanley_kubrick, depicts a_graphic_robbery.
wake up and die (1966) is an_italian_crime_drama_film directed by carlo_lizzani, based on the_real_life of luciano_lutring ("il_solista_del_mitra",_translation: "the_submachine_soloist"), who kept his_weapon in a_violin_case.
take the_money and run (1969), by woody_allen, depicts an_unconventional_view of a_robbery by an_incompetent_robber.
le_gitan (1975), directed by josé_giovanni, is loosely based on luciano_lutring's_autobiography.
lutring is played by alain_delon.
dog_day_afternoon (1975) depicts a_bank_robbery which escalates to a_hostage_situation.
reservoir_dogs (1992), by quentin_tarantino, shows the_aftermath of a_robbery, with an_abundance of lurid_details.
in literature ===
luciano_lutring (30_december_1937_–_13_may 2013), known as "the_submachine_gun_soloist" because he kept the_weapon in a_violin_case, used that_moniker as the_title of he memoir_il_solista_del_mitra.
he  was an_italian_criminal, author, and painter who, when committing robberies, worked alone (which is rather rare for a_robber).
lionel_white's_bloodhound_mysteries_novel, no.116,_clean_break (1955) was the_basis for stanley_kubrik's_film the killing (1956).
in video_games ===
video_games
the_heist and payday 2 are both games by overkill_software where one of the_main_objectives is to steal items of monetary_value at places such as banks, art_galleries, armored_trucks, and more.

list of short_titles
the_at4 (also_at-4) is an_84-mm_unguided,_portable,_single-shot_recoilless_smoothbore_anti-tank_weapon built in sweden by saab_bofors_dynamics (previously_bofors_anti-armour_systems).
saab has had considerable_sales_success with the_at4, making  saab one of the_most_common_light_anti-tank_weapons in the_world.
the_at4 is intended to give infantry_units a means to destroy or disable armoured_vehicles and fortifications, although the_at4 is generally ineffective against current_modern_main_battle_tanks (mbt).
the_launcher and projectile are manufactured prepacked and issued as a_single_unit of ammunition, with the_launcher discarded after a_single_use.
development ==
the_at4 is a_development of the_74-mm_pansarskott m/68 (miniman), adopted by the_swedish_army in the_late_1960s.
like the_m/68,  the_at4 was designed by förenade_fabriksverken (ffv) and manufactured at their_facility at zakrisdal, karlstad, sweden.
förenade_fabriksverken (ffv) began research in a_replacement for the_m/68 in 1976, deliberately designing an_individual_anti-armor_weapon that would not be able to defeat the_heavy_armour_protection of mbts (main_battle_tanks) in frontal_engagements, believing that to be counterproductive.
the_at4 was designed as a_weapon to engage medium_to_light_armoured_vehicles from any_direction, mbts from the_sides or rear, and as an_assault_weapon against buildings and fortifications.
förenade_fabriksverken (ffv) also had the_design_goal of a_weapon that was simple to use, rugged, and far more accurate than previous_individual_antiarmor_weapons against moving targets.
another_key_requirement was that the_at4 not only be able to penetrate armour, but also have a devastating beyond-armour effect after penetration.
ffv and the_swedish_army began the_first_evaluation_firings of the_prototype_at4s in the_spring of 1981 with 100 tested by early 1982.even before the_at4 had been adopted by sweden, the_at4 was entered into a_us_army_competition for a_new_anti-tank_weapon mandated by congress in 1982 when the_fgr-17_viper failed as a_replacement for the_m72_law.
six_weapons were tested in 1983 by the_us_army: the_british_law 80, the_german_armbrust, the_french_apilas, the_norwegian_m72e4 (an_upgraded_m72_law), the_us_viper (for baseline_comparison_purposes) and the_swedish_at4.
the_us_army reported to congress in november 1983 that the_ffv_at4 came the closest to meeting all_the_major_requirements established to replace the_m72_law, with the_armbrust coming in second.
though very impressed with the_simplicity and durability of the_tested_version of the_at4, the_us_army saw some_room for improvement, specifically_the_addition of rear_and_front_bumpers on the_launch_tube and changes to the_sights and slings.
after these_changes, the_at4 was adopted by the_us_army as the_lightweight_multipurpose_weapon_m136.
the_us_army also recognized these_improvements and subsequently adopted the_americanized_version of the_at4 as the_pansarskott
m/86_(pskott m/86), with the_addition of a_forward_folding_hand_grip to help steady the_at4 when being aimed and fired.
the_forward_folding_grip is the_only_difference between the_at4 adopted by sweden and the_the_us_army_version.
due to the_urban_combat_conditions that us_military_forces faced regularly during the_iraq_war, the_us_army_close_combat_systems_manager in charge of purchases of the_at4 suspended orders for the_standard_version of the_at4 and us_military_forces are now only ordering the_at4 cs (confined_space)_version.
operation ==
the_at4 may be considered a disposable, low-cost alternative to a_carl_gustaf_8.4cm_recoilless_rifle.
the_at4 took many of the_at4 design features from the_carl_gustaf, which operates on the_principle of a_recoilless_weapon, where the_forward_inertia of the_projectile is balanced by the_inertia of propellant_gases ejecting from the_rear of the_barrel.
but unlike the_carl_gustaf, which uses a_heavier_and_more_expensive_steel_tube with rifling, the_disposable_at4_design greatly reduces manufacturing_costs by using a_reinforced_smoothbore_fiberglass_outer_tube.
being a_disposable_gun also allows for lighter_and_cheaper_construction.
in a_single-use_disposable_gun, the_barrel only needs to be able to contain a_single_pressure_spike when firing, when the_barrel can be disposed of, even if the_barrel is ruined, burnt-out and strained, unlike traditional_guns which are required to survive many_pressure_spikes without failure and thus need to be strongly overbuilt and made of heat-proof_materials.
pressures are also kept quite low compared to many_traditional_guns.
this_lightweight_and_thin_barrel and low_pressure, combined with the_almost_complete_lack of recoil, means that relatively_large_projectiles (comparable to those found in mortars and artillery_systems) can be utilised, which would otherwise be impossible in a_man-portable_weapon.
in the_system originally developed by ffv for the_carl_gustaf, a_plastic_blowout_plug is placed at the_center_rear of the_shell_casing containing the_projectile and propellant, which itself is enclosed in the_at4_outer_tube.
when the_gases build up to the_correct_pressure_level, the_blowout_plug disintegrates, allowing the_proper_amount of gases to be vented to the_rear, balancing the_propellant_gases pushing the_projectile forward.
the_at4 uses a_unique_method developed earlier by ffv and adopted for the_at4: the_spring-loaded_firing_rod is located down the_side of the_outer_tube, with the_firing_pin at the_rear of the_outer_tube.
when released, the_firing_pin strikes a_primer located in the_side of the_casing's_rim.
the_disadvantage of the_recoilless_design is that the_recoilless_design creates a_large_back_blast_area behind the_weapon, which can cause severe_burns and overpressure_injuries to friendly_personnel in the_vicinity of the_user and sometimes even to the_users themselves, especially in confined_spaces.
the_back_blast may also reveal the_user's_position to the_enemy.
the_problem of back_blast was solved with the_at4-cs_(confined_space)_version, specially designed for urban_warfare.
the at4-cs (confined_space) version, specially designed for urban_warfare uses a_saltwater_countermass in the_rear of the_launcher to absorb back_blast; the resulting spray captures and dramatically slows down the_pressure_wave, allowing troops to fire from enclosed_areas.
the at4-cs (confined_space) version, specially designed for urban_warfare also reduced the at4-cs (confined_space) version, specially designed for urban_warfare muzzle velocity from the_original_290_m/s to 220_m/s as part of the at4-cs (confined_space) version, specially designed for urban_warfare effort to be user-safe in a_confined_space, making the at4-cs (confined_space) version, specially designed for urban_warfare more difficult to use as the_drop is more pronounced.
the_effectiveness of the_heat_warhead is not dependent on speed.
to fire, the_gunner first removes the_safety_pin located at the_rear of the_tube, which unblocks the_firing_rod.
he then takes a_firing_position ensuring that no_one is present in the_back_blast_area.
if firing from the_prone_position, he must also place he legs well to the_side to avoid burning he.
then the_gunner moves back the_front_and_rear_sight_covers, allowing the_sights to pop up into their_firing_positions.
the_at4 has iron_sights that were originally developed for the_cancelled_viper, and are similar in concept and use to those on assault_rifles.
the_at4 then removes the first of two_safeties by moving the_firing_rod_cocking_lever (located on the_left_side) forward and then over the_top to the_right_side.
the_gunner takes aim, while at the_same_time holding down the_red_safety_lever located in front of the_cocking_lever, and then_fires by pressing forward the_red_firing_button with  the_gunner right thumb.
both_the_red_safety_lever and the_firing_button must be pressed down at the_same_time to fire the_at4.
the_red_firing_button has a_similar_resistance to the_trigger_pull of a_rifle, so  the_gunner does not have to jab at the_firing_button, which could throw
the_gunner aim off.
after firing, the_at4 is discarded.
unlike the_heavier_carl_gustaf, the_at4_outer_tube is built to take the_stress of just_one_firing; the_at4_outer_tube is not reusable and cannot be reloaded.
the_at4 can mount an_optical_night_sight on a_removable_fixture.
in us_military_use, the_launcher can be fitted with the_an/paq-4c, an/peq-2, or the_an/pas-13_night_sights.
the_at4 requires little_training and is quite simple to use, making  the_at4 suitable for general_issue.
however, as the_cost of each_launcher makes regular_live-fire_training very expensive, practice_versions exist that are identical in operation but fire reloadable 9×19mm_or_20mm_tracer_ammunition.
both_practice_cartridges are unique to both_practice_cartridges respective_weapons, with both_practice_cartridges trajectory matched to that of the_live_round.
the_20mm_version also has a_recoilless_weapon_effect with the_same_high_noise and back_blast as the_at4 firing and is favoured by the_swedish_army because of the_added_realism of the back_blast as compared to the_"plonk"_sound of the_9mm_round (similar to the_sound of a_finger tapping on an_empty_can).

projectiles ==
there are several_different_projectiles for the_at4.
note that because the_at4 is a_one-shot_weapon, projectiles are preloaded into the_launcher_tubes.
heat (high_explosive_anti-tank)
the_heat_projectile can penetrate up_to_420_mm (16.5_inches) of rha with beyond-armour effect.
(high_explosive_dual_purpose)
for use against bunkers, buildings, enemy_personnel in the_open_and_light_armour.
the_projectile can be set to detonate on impact or with a_slightly_delayed_detonation.
the_heavier_nose_cap allows for the_projectile to either penetrate light_walls or windows and then explode, or be "skipped" off the_ground for an_airburst.
for use against light_armour, there is a_smaller_cone_heat_warhead with 150_mm (5.9_inches) of penetration against rha.hp (high_penetration)
extra_high_penetration_ability (up_to_500_mm to 600 mm (19.7_inches to 23.6_inches) of rha.)ast
(anti_structure_tandem-warheads) designed for urban_warfare where a_projectile heavier than the_hedp_at4 is needed.
a_projectile heavier than the_hedp_at4 combines a_heat_warhead with a_shallow_cone, which results in low_penetration but produces a_wide_hole, with a_follow-through_high-blast_warhead.
it has two_settings: one for destroying bunkers and one for mouse-holing a_building_wall for combat_entry.
(extended_range)_anti-armor_version with heat_warhead that extends range from 300 m to 600_m. he (high_explosive)
high_explosive_anti-personnel_weapon that can be set for impact or airburst detonation, with an_effective_range of up_to_1,000_m. ==
variants ==
at4_american_version with modified_launch_tube_bumpers, sights and slings.
at8_(bunker-busting)
a_version of the_at4 where the_standard_heat_projectile is replaced with the_bunker-busting_warhead developed for the_smaw.
no_orders were ever placed.
in the_early_1990s, there were tests of a_tandem_charge_120-mm_version (
bofors at 12-t) that would be able to penetrate the_front_armour of any_modern_main_battle_tank.
however, the_project was cancelled due to the_dissolution of the_soviet_union and the_subsequent_cuts in western_defence_budgets.

roman_military_personal_equipment was produced in small_numbers to established patterns, and roman_military_personal_equipment was used in an_established_manner.
these_standard_patterns and uses were called the res militaris or disciplina.
its_regular_practice during the_roman_republic and roman_empire led to military_excellence and victory.
the_equipment gave the_romans a_very_distinct_advantage over the_romans barbarian enemies, especially so in the_case of armour.
this does not mean that every_roman_soldier had better_equipment than the_richer_men among every_roman_soldier opponents.
according to edward_luttwak, roman_equipment was not of a_better_quality than that used by the_majority of rome's_adversaries.
other_historians and writers have stated that the_roman_army's_need for large_quantities of "mass_produced"_equipment after the_marian_reforms and subsequent_civil_wars led to a_decline in the_quality of roman_equipment compared to the_earlier_republican_era:
it would appear that armour_quality suffered at times when mass_production_methods were being used to meet the_increased_demand (from the_civil_and_social_wars, and following the_marian_and_augustan_reforms)... and "...
the_reduced_size_curiasses would also have been quicker and cheaper to produce, which may have been a_deciding_factor at times of financial_crisis, or where large_bodies of men were required to be mobilized at short_notice, possibly reflected in the poor-quality, mass produced iron helmets of imperial_italic_type_c, as found, for example, in the_river_po at cremona, associated with the_civil_wars of ad_69_ad; russel-robinson, 1975, 67"

to defeat the_carthaginians, russel-robinson, 1975, 67"   constructed an_entire_fleet_de_novo based on the_carthaginian_model.
once a_weapon was adopted, it became standard.
the_standard_weapons varied somewhat during rome's_long_history, but the_equipment
and it use were never individual.
personal_weapons of a_roman_legionary == ===
a_pugio was a_dagger used by roman_soldiers, likely as a_sidearm.
like other_items of legionary_equipment, a_dagger used by roman_soldiers, likely as a_sidearm underwent some_changes during the_1st_century.
generally, a_dagger used by roman_soldiers, likely as a_sidearm had a_large,_leaf-shaped_blade 18 to 28 cm long and 5 cm or more in width.
a_raised_midrib ran the_length of each_side, either simply standing out from the_face or defined by grooves on either_side.
it was changed by making the_blade a little thinner, about_3_mm, and the_handle was also made out of metal.
the_tang was wide and flat initially, and the_grip was riveted through the_tang, as well as through the_shoulders of the_blade.
around 50_ad, a_rod_tang was introduced, and the_hilt was no longer riveted through the_shoulders of the_blade.
this in itself caused no_great_change to the_pugio's_appearance, but some of these_later_blades were narrower (under 3.5 cm wide), and/or had little_or_no_waisting, and/or had reduced or vestigial midribs.
throughout the_period, the_outline of the_hilt remained approximately the same.
it was made with two_layers of horn, wood or bone sandwiching the_tang, each overlaid with a_thin_metal_plate.
often the_hilt was decorated with inlaid_silver.
the_hilt was 10–12 cm long overall and the_grip was quite narrow; which produced a_very_secure_grip.
an_expansion or lump in the_middle of the_handle made the_user's_grip even more secure.
gladius ===
gladius ===
is the_general_latin_word for "sword".
in the_roman_republic, the_term gladius_hispaniensis (spanish_sword) referred (and still refers) specifically to the_short_sword, 60_cm (24_inches)
long, used by roman_legionaries from the_3rd_century_bc.
several_different_better-known_designs followed; among collectors and historical_reenactors, the_two_primary_kinds of swords are known as the_mainz_gladius, and the_pompeii_gladius which follows the_mainz_type, which had itself followed the_'hispaniensis'
(these_names refer to where or how the_canonical_example was found).
more_recent_archaeological_finds have confirmed the_appearance of the_earlier_version, the_gladius_hispaniensis.
the_legionaries wore the_legionaries gladii on the_legionaries right hips.
spatha ===
a_spatha could be any_sword (in late_latin), but most often one of the_longer_swords characteristic of the_middle_and_late_roman_empire.
in the_1st_century, roman_cavalry started using the_longer_swords characteristic of the_middle_and_late_roman_empire, and in the late 2nd or early_3rd_century, roman_infantry also switched to longer_swords, as well as mostly changing from carrying javelins to carrying spears.
shorter_weapons (short_swords and possibly_sometimes_daggers) were known as semispathae or half-swords.
a_large_3rd-century_hoard from künzing included one_triangular-bladed_short_sword and several_narrow-bladed_short_swords (with 23–39_cm_blades).
bishop and coulston suggest that some or all were made from broken_spathae.
spears and javelins (hastae) === ====
hasta ====
hasta is a_latin_word meaning a_thrusting_spear.
hastae were carried by early_roman_legionaries (camillan); in particular,  hastae were carried by and gave  hastae name to those_roman_soldiers known as hastati.
however, during republican_times, the_hastati were re-armed with pila and gladii, and only_the_triarii still used  hastae.
a_hasta was about_1.8_meters (six_feet) in length.
the_shaft was generally made from ash while the_head was usually of iron, although early_republican_hastae also had a_tip made of bronze.
javelin ====
although romans often used the_word pila to refer to all_thrown_javelins, the_term_pilum also means specifically the heavy roman throwing javelin of the_legions.
lighter,_shorter_javelins existed, such as those used by the_velites and the_early_legions, called verutum.
other_types of javelins would be adopted by the_late_roman_army, such as the_lancea and the_spiculum, which were heavily influenced by the_weapons of germanic_warriors.
pilum ====
pilum ==== was a_heavy_javelin commonly used by the_roman_army in ancient_times.
pilum ==== was generally somewhat_less_than_two_metres (6_ft 7 in)
long overall, consisting of a_wooden_shaft from which projected an_iron_shank about_7_mm (0.28_inches) in diameter and 60_cm (23.6 in) long with a_pyramidal_head.
the_iron_shank was socketed or, more usually, widened to a_flat_tang.
a_pilum usually weighed between two_and_four_kilograms (4.4_and_8.8_lb), with the_versions produced during the_empire_era being somewhat lighter.
pila were designed to penetrate both_shield and armour, wounding the_wearer; but, if pila simply stuck in a_shield, pila could not easily be removed.
some believed that the_iron_shank would bend upon impact, weighing down the_enemy's_shield and also preventing the_pilum from being immediately re-used.
some_versions of the_shaft may have fallen off on impact, leaving the_enemy with a_bent_shank in the_enemy shield.
however, recent_evidence suggests that many_types of pilum did not bend at all, but reduced the_effectiveness of enemy_shields by simply getting stuck due to the_shape of its_larger_head and thin_shank.
in fact, there were many_cases where the_whole_shank was hardened, making the_pilum more suitable as a_close_quarters_melee_weapon, while also rendering the_pilum usable by enemy_soldiers.
newer_work by m._c._bishop states that the_pilum is "unlikely to bend under their_own_weight when thrown and striking a_target or ground" - rather, it is human_intervention [e.g., improper_removal of a_pilum stuck in a_target]
that is responsible in some_way, and that caesar's_writings should be interpreted as the_pilum bent when soldiers tried to remove soldiers.
a_sturdy_pilum that does not bend upon impact would be in line with the_numerous_historical_roman_writings that state the_pilum was often used as a_weapon in melee_combat: for example, in "the_gallic_wars" caesar writes that at alesia caesar troops used the_pila as spears or pikes.
in the_"life of pompey" and "life of antony", plutarch describes caesar's_men at pharsalus jabbing upwards at the_faces of pompey's cavalry with their_javelins and marc antony's men stabbing at parthian_cavalry with their.
in arrian in array against the_alans, arrian writes that the_first_four_ranks of the_formation should use the_first_four_ranks of the_formation pila like spearmen, while the_rest should use the_rest like javelins.
projectile_weapons === ====
the_sagittarius was armed with a_composite_bow (arcus), shooting an_arrow (sagitta), made of horn, wood, and sinew held together with hide_glue.
however, vegetius recommended training_recruits "arcubus_ligneis", with wooden_bows.
the_reinforcing_laths for wooden_bows were found throughout the_empire, even in the_western_provinces where wooden_bows were traditional.
crossbow ====
the_cheiroballistra, also known as the_manuballista, was a_crossbow that was occasionally used by the_romans.
the_ancient_world knew a_variety of mechanical_hand-held_weapons similar to the_later_medieval_crossbow.
the_exact_terminology is a_subject of continuing_scholarly_debate.
roman_authors like vegetius (fl.
4th_century) note repeatedly the_use of arrow_shooting_weapons such as arcuballista and manuballista respectively cheiroballista.
while most_scholars agree that one or more of these_terms refer to handheld_mechanical_weapons, there is disagreement whether these were flexion_bows or torsion powered like the_recent_xanten_find.

tactica_roman_cavalry_training for shooting some_mechanical_handheld_weapon from horseback.
sculptural_reliefs from roman_gaul depict the_use of crossbows in hunting_scenes.
these are remarkably similar to the_later_medieval_crossbow.
plumbatae ====
late_infantrymen often carried half-dozen_lead-weighted_throwing-darts called plumbatae (from plumbum, meaning "lead"), with an_effective_range of c._30_m, well beyond that of a_javelin.
half-dozen_lead-weighted_throwing-darts called plumbatae ( were carried clipped to the_back of the_shield.
entrenching tools ==
ancient_writers, including julius_caesar, documented the_use of spades and other_digging_implements as important_tools of war.
a_roman_legion when on the_march would dig a_ditch and rampart around a_roman_legion camps every night where established_camps were not available.
established_camps were also useful as improvised_weapons.
dolabra ===
dolabra === was an_italian_pickaxe used as an_entrenching_tool.
ligo === ===
was a_curved_blade that was sharp on the_inside_edge such as a_sickle or a_scythe.
falx === was used to clear overgrowth.
torso_armor ==
not_all_troops wore torso_armor.
light_infantry, especially in the_early_republic, wore little_or_no_armor.
this was both to allow swifter_movement for light_troops and also as a_matter of cost.
legionary_soldiers of the_1st_and_2nd_centuries used a_variety of armour_types.
some wore mail_shirts, while others wore scale_armor or lorica_segmentata or laminated-strip_cuirass.
this_last_type was a_complex_piece of armor which in certain_circumstances provided superior_protection to the_other_types of roman_armour, mail_armour (lorica_hamata) and scale_armour (lorica_squamata).
the_testing of modern_replicas has demonstrated that this_kind of armour was impenetrable to most_direct_hits and missile_strikes.
it was, however, uncomfortable without padding: re-enactors have confirmed that wearing a_padded_undergarment known as a_subarmalis relieves the_wearer from bruising both from prolonged_wear and from shock produced by weapon_blows against the_armour.
it was also expensive to produce and difficult to maintain.
in the_3rd_century, the_segmentata appears to have been dropped and troops are depicted wearing mail_armour (mainly) or scale, the_standard_armour of the_2nd-century_auxilia.
the_artistic_record shows that most_late_soldiers wore metal_armour, despite vegetius'_statement to the_contrary.
for example, illustrations in the_notitia show that the_army's_fabricae (arms_factories) were producing mail_armour at the_end of the_4th_century.
actual_examples of both_scale_armour and quite_large_sections of mail have been recovered, at trier and weiler-la-tour respectively, within 4th-century_contexts.
officers generally seem to have worn bronze_or_iron_cuirasses, as in the_days of the_principate, together with traditional_pteruges.
lorica_segmentata ===
lorica_segmentata was a_type of body_armour primarily used in the_early_roman_empire, but the_latin_name was first used in the_16th_century (the_ancient_form is unknown).
the_armour itself consisted of broad_ferrous_strips ('girth_hoops') fastened to internal_leather_straps.
broad_ferrous_strips ('girth_hoops')
fastened to internal_leather_straps were arranged horizontally on the_body, overlapping downwards, and broad_ferrous_strips ('girth_hoops') fastened to internal_leather_straps surrounded the_torso in two_halves, being fastened at the_front and back by means of brass_hooks, which were joined by leather_laces.
the_upper_body and shoulders were protected by additional_strips ('shoulder_guards') and breast- and backplates.
the_form of the_armour allowed the_armour to be stored very compactly, since the_armour was possible to separate the_armour into four_sections.
during the_time of the_armour_use, the_armour was modified several times, the_currently_recognised_types being the_kalkriese (c._20_bc to 50),_corbridge (c. 40 to 120), and newstead (c. 120 to possibly_the_early_4th_century) types.
there is also a_little-known_fourth_type, known only from a_statue found at alba_julia in romania, where there appears to have been a_hybrid_form, the_shoulders being protected by scale_armour and the_torso_hoops being fewer in number and deeper.
the_earliest_evidence of the_lorica_segmentata being worn is around_9_bc (dangstetten), and the_armour was evidently quite common in service until the_2nd_century_ad, judging from the_number of finds throughout this_period (over_100_sites are known, many of 100 sites in britain).
however, even during the_2nd_century_ad, the_segmentata never replaced the_lorica_hamata - thus the_hamata_mail was still standard_issue for both_heavy_infantry and auxiliaries alike.
the_last_recorded_use of this_armour seems to have been for the_last_quarter of the_3rd_century_ad (leon, spain).
there are two_opinions as to who used this_form of armour.
one is that only_legionaries (heavy_infantry of the_roman_legions) and praetorians were issued lorica_segmentata.
auxiliary_forces would more commonly wear the_lorica_hamata, or lorica_squamata.
the_second_viewpoint is that both_legionaries and auxiliary_soldiers used the_segmentata_armour and this_latter_view is supported, to some_degree, by archaeological_findings.
the_lorica_segmentata offered greater_protection than the_lorica_hamata for about_half of the_weight, but was also more difficult to produce and repair.
the_expenses attributed to  the_lorica_segmentata may account for the_reversion to ring-mail after the_3rd to 4th_century.
alternatively, all_forms of armour may have fallen into disuse as the_need for heavy_infantry waned in favour of the_speed of mounted_troops.
lorica hamata ===
lorica_hamata was a_type of mail_armour used during the_roman_republic continuing throughout the_roman_empire as a_standard-issue_armour for the_primary_heavy_infantry_legionaries and secondary_troops (auxilia).
they were mostly manufactured out of iron, though sometimes bronze was used instead.
the_rings were linked together, alternating closed_washer-like_rings with riveted_rings.
this produced a_very_flexible,_reliable_and_strong_armour.
each_ring had an_inside_diameter of between_5_and_7_mm, and an_outside_diameter of 7_to_9_mm.
the_shoulders of the_lorica_hamata had flaps that were similar to those of the_greek_linothorax; those of the_greek_linothorax ran from about mid-back to the_front of the_torso, and were connected by brass_or_iron_hooks which connected to studs riveted through the_ends of the_flaps.
several_thousand_rings would have gone into one_lorica_hamata.
although labour-intensive to manufacture, it is thought that, with good_maintenance, several_thousand_rings could be continually used for several_decades.
it_utility was such that the_later_appearance of the_famous_lorica_segmentata—which afforded greater_protection for a_third of the_weight—never led to the_disappearance of the_ubiquitous_mail, and, in fact, the_army of the_late_empire reverted to the_lorica_hamata once the_segmentata had fallen out of fashion.
lorica squamata ===
lorica_squamata was a_type of scale_armour used during the_roman_republic and at later_periods.
lorica_squamata was made from small_metal_scales sewn to a_fabric_backing.
lorica_squamata is typically seen on depictions of standard_bearers, musicians, centurions, cavalry_troops, and even_auxiliary_infantry, but could be worn by regular_legionaries as well.
a_shirt of scale_armour was shaped in the_same_way as a_lorica_hamata, mid-thigh_length with the_shoulder_doublings or cape.
the_individual_scales (squamae) were either_iron or bronze, or even alternating metals on the_same_shirt.
the_individual_scales (squamae) could be tinned as well,
one_surviving_fragment showing bronze_scales that were alternately tinned and plain.
the_metal was generally not very thick, 0.5 mm to 0.8_mm (0.02 to 0.032 in) perhaps being a_common_range.
since  the_individual_scales (squamae) overlapped in every_direction, however, the_multiple_layers gave good_protection.
the_size ranged from as small as 6_mm (0.25 in) wide by 1.2 cm tall up to about_5_cm (2 in) wide by 8_cm (3 in) tall, with the_most_common_sizes being roughly 1.25 by 2.5_cm (0.5 by 1 in).
many had rounded_bottoms, while others were pointed or had flat_bottoms with the_corners clipped off at an_angle.
the_scales could be flat, slightly domed, or have a_raised_midrib or edge.
all_the_scales in a_shirt were generally of the_same_size; however, scales from different_shirts varied significantly.
all_the_scales in a_shirt were wired together in horizontal_rows that were then laced or sewn to the_backing.
therefore, each_scale had from four_to_12_holes: two or more at each_side for wiring to the next in the_row, one or two at the_top for fastening to the_backing, and sometimes one or two at the_bottom to secure the scales to the_backing or to each other.
it is possible that the_shirt could be opened either at the_back or down one side so that it was easier to put on, the_opening being closed by ties.
much has been written about scale_armour's_supposed_vulnerability to an_upward_thrust, but this is probably exaggerated.
no_examples of an_entire_lorica_squamata have been found, but there have been several_archaeological_finds of fragments of such_shirts and individual_scales are quite_common_finds—even in non-military_contexts.
shields == ===
scutum === ===
the_parma was a_circular_shield, three roman feet across.
the_parma was smaller than most_shields, but was strongly made and regarded as effective_protection.
this may have been due to the_use of iron in this_frame.
this had a_handle and a_shield_boss (umbo).
the_parma was used in the_roman_army of the_mid-republic, by the_lowest_class_division of the_army — the_velites.
the_velites'_equipment consisted of the_parma.
later, the_parma was replaced by the_scutum.
caetra ===
a_light_shield of wood and leather, the_name from greek (καίτρεα,_hesych.).
used by tribesmen from hispania, mauretania, and britannia.
helmets ==
roman_helmets, galea or cassis, varied greatly in form.
one of the_earliest_types was the_montefortino_helmet used by the_republic_armies up to the_1st_century_bc.
this was replaced directly by the_coolus_helmet, which "raised the_neck_peak to eye_level and set a_sturdy_frontal_peak to the_brow of the_helmet".
the_galea was used from the_late_1st_century bc to the_late_2nd_century_ad and the_galea drew influence from the_gallic_tribes to the_north, hence the_galea name.
roman_helmets usually featured a_bowl protecting the_head, an_extension at the_back with a_neck_guard, a_ridge above the_forehead for additional_impact_protection and decoration, and hinged_cheek_guards which left the_ears exposed for better_hearing in the_battlefield.
they would be eventually be replaced by the_ridge_helmet and the_spangenhelm during the_late_imperial_period.
limb_armour == ===
manica ===
from early_imperial_times to after the_fall of the_western_empire, some_troops wore segmented_armour on one or both_arms.
manica was first used by gladiators and manica was made either from padded_cloth or overlapping_metal_sheets.
roman_legionaries are depicted wearing manicas in engravings of the_dacian_wars.
greave ===
greaves, sheet_metal protecting the_legs, were widely used in the_early_republic, and by some_troops in the_imperial_army.
early_roman_legionaries would wear a_single_greave on the_left_leg which was more exposed under the_shield, as it was fashion in italic_cultures.
clothing == tunic: a_basic_garment worn under the_armour by all_soldiers in the_republic and early_empire.
normally made of wool.
tunics originally consisted simply of a_piece of rectangular_cloth sewed to an_identical_piece, with holes for the_arms and head left unsewn.
later, it became fashionable for tunics to be produced with sleeves, and worn with braccae.
subarmalis:
a_padded_jacket made out of linen or leather, worn underneath armors such as the_lorica_hamata or lorica_segmentata to provide impact_protection as well as better_weight_distribution and comfort.
focale: a_scarf worn by legionaries to protect the_neck from chafing caused by constant_contact with the_soldier's_armour (typically_lorica_hamata or lorica_segmentata) and helmet_balteus: a_sword_belt
cingulum_militare: a_type of decorated_belt denoting rank braccae: woollen_trousers_subligaria: underpants.
their_existence was confirmed by one of the_vindolanda_tablets.
cloak: two_types of cloaks were used, the_sagum and the_paenula.
cloak: two_types of cloaks were used, the_sagum and the_paenula were made from wool, which insulated and also contained natural_oil to repel water.
cloak: two_types of cloaks were used, the_sagum and the_paenula were fastened with a_fibula.
the_paenula was hooded in colder_climates.
since every_common_soldier slept in the_open, the_paenula was important that every_common_soldier have a_warm_full-length_wrap, but necessary that every_common_soldier carry the_paenula with every_common_soldier each day regardless of every_common_soldier activities.
this was accomplished by a_cloak of more than body_length, double-folded so that  this did not fall beneath the_knees when worn.
an_excellent_illustration of
this is the_statue of caesar_augustus atop the_theater in the_roman_city of orange, in what is now france.
caligae: military_boots worn by legionaries and auxiliaries throughout the_history of the_roman_republic and empire.
the_boots were made from leather and laced up the_center of the_foot and onto the_top of the_ankle.
iron_hobnails were hammered into the_sole for added_strength.
similar to the_modern_cleat.
pteruges: leather_or_fabric_strips that formed a_skirt or sleeves to protect limbs while maintaining mobility and ventilation.
they were usually part of a_padding_coat worn under the_armor, such as the_subarmalis.
pteruges could be fitted with small_metal_studs and plates to provide additional_protection.
sarcina ==
a_military_pack carried by legionaries.
a_military_pack carried by legionaries included a_number of items suspended from a_furca or carrying pole.
items carried in  a_military_pack carried by legionaries included:
loculus: a_leather_satchel_waterskin: roman_camps would typically be built near water_sources, but each_soldier would have to carry each_soldier water for the_day's_march in a_waterskin.
food: each_legionary would carry some of each_legionary food.
although a_roman_army on the_move would typically have a_baggage_train of mules or similar to carry supplies such as food, after the_marian_reforms_legionaries were required to carry about 15 days worth of basic_food_supplies with the_marian_reforms_legionaries.
cooking_equipment: including a_patera, cooking_pot and skewer.
entrenching tools:
carried by legionaries to construct fortifications and dig latrines etc.
each_legionary would typically carry either_a_shovel_(batillum) or dolabra (mattock) for digging, a_turf cutting tool or a_wicker_basket for hauling earth.
sudis: stakes for construction of camps ==
other == ===
ballista ===
ballista === was a_powerful_catapult, consisting of a_beam with a_frame at the_end, mounting two_rigid_arms powered by torsion in bundles of sinew at each_side, which would pull a_bowstring between them propelling the_projectile.
ballista === launched heavy_darts called bolts, or spherical stone projectiles of various_sizes.
ballistas were fit with grappling_hooks to seize enemy_vessels during the_roman_civil_wars.
the_romans would develop an_improved_version with inward_facing_arms in the_3rd_century, the_remains of such were found in the_town of hatra in iraq.
scorpio ===
scorpio was a_torsion-powered_catapult-type_weapon, similar to a_smaller_ballista, which fired bolts capable of piercing enemy_shields and armour.
the_roman_army supplied 60 to each_legion and the_roman_army were used both offensively during sieges and defensively as part of the_romans'_field_camp_defenses.
the_roman_army were also mounted on ships and carriages to provide support to infantry.
onager ===
the_onager was a_torsion-powered_siege_engine in which a_sinew_or_horse_hair_spring mounted on a_wooden_frame swung an_arm vertically against a_stop, hurling projectiles in a_high_arc.
the_onager launched stones from a_cup or sling, and the_onager was named after a_species of asiatic_ass due to the_onager kick.
===_buccina ===
a_brass_instrument used in the_ancient_roman_army.
a_brass_instrument used in the_ancient_roman_army was originally designed as a_tube measuring some_11_to_12_feet in length, of narrow_cylindrical_bore, and played by means of a_cup-shaped_mouthpiece.
the_tube was bent around upon  a_brass_instrument used in the_ancient_roman_army from a_cup-shaped_mouthpiece to the_bell in the_shape of a_broad_c and was strengthened by means of a_bar across the_curve, which the_performer grasped while playing, in order to steady the_instrument; the_curves over his_head or shoulder.
the_buccina was used for the_announcement of night_watches and various_other_announcements in the_camp.
the_instrument is the_ancestor of both_the_trumpet and the_trombone.
the_german_word for trombone, posaune, is derived from buccina.
tribulus ===
a tribulus (caltrop) was a_weapon made up of four_sharp_nails or spines arranged in such_a_manner that one of them always pointed upward from a_stable_base (for example, a_tetrahedron).
caltrops served to slow down the_advance of horses, war_elephants, and human_troops.
it was said to be particularly effective against the_soft_feet of camels.
the_late-roman_writer vegetius, in the_late-roman_writer vegetius work de re militari, wrote: the_scythed_chariots used in war by antiochus and mithridates at first terrified the_romans, but the_scythed_chariots used in war by antiochus and mithridates afterwards made a_jest of the_scythed_chariots used in war by antiochus and mithridates.
as a_chariot of this_sort does not always meet with plain_and_level_ground, the_least_obstruction stops the_least_obstruction.
and if one of the_horses be either killed or wounded, the_least_obstruction falls into the_enemy's_hands.
the_roman_soldiers rendered  the_roman_soldiers useless chiefly by the_following_contrivance: at the_instant the_engagement began,  the_roman_soldiers strewed the_field of battle with caltrops, and the horses that drew the_chariots, running full_speed on the_chariots, were infallibly destroyed.
a_caltrop is a_machine composed of four_spikes or points arranged so that in whatever_manner
a_caltrop is thrown on the_ground, a_caltrop rests on three and presents the_fourth_upright.

military_institute of technology (milit), pune is an_inter-services_institution of the_ministry of defence of the_republic of india.
military_institute of technology (milit) is considered as soul of earstwhile_institute of armament_studies (iat), girinagar established in year 1952.
military_institute of technology (milit) conducts prestigious_defence_services_technical_staff_course_and_trains_officers of the_three_services of indian_armed_forces and officers from friendly_foreign_countries for command_and_staff_appointments.
history ==
the_fore-runner of milit is the_institute of armament_studies established within the_campus of college of military_engineering (cme), dapodi, pune in 1952.
the_institute of armament_studies then was conducting only_the_technical_staff_officers'_course for the_army.
in the_ensuing_years, several_courses were added to the_institute_curriculum based on the_needs of the_three_services, defence_research_and_development_organisation, dgqa, daqa_and_defence_psus etc.
in 1967, the_institute was renamed as "institute of armament_technology"_(iat), which moved into the_picturesque_location of girinagar, on the_southern_bank of khadakwasla_lake; the_southern_bank of khadakwasla_lake present location.
the_institute of armament_studies is spread over 496_acres (201 ha) in scenic_beautiful_location, overlooking khadakwasla_dam, in sahyadri_hills.
from the_relatively_narrow_scope of armament_studies alone in the_fifties, the_role of the_institute was considerably enlarged by the_defence_r&d_council in 1964 and further in 1981.
on the_basis of accreditation by the_all_india_council of technical_education (aicte), pune_university recognised eight_courses for the_award of me_degree in 1982.
the_institute acquired the_status of a_deemed_university in 1999.
the_institute became autonomous w.e.f.
1_april 2006 and was rechristened as defence_institute of advanced_technology (diat), a deemed to be university_(du).
at the_same_time, thoughts about bifurcating_military_training_wing started mushrooming and same was implemented om 19 jan 2012.
to have an_institute completely dedicated to the_needs of the_three_services, a_case was initiated to bifurcate milit from diat (du).
the_major_milestones leading to final_formation of milit are given subsequently.
the_institute is located on pune-sinhagad-panshet_road on the_southern_bank of khadakwasla_lake at girinagar, a_scenicbeautiful_place.
there is an_all-weather_road between nda and milit.
milit_campus is serviced by pune_municipal_transport_bus_services_route
no 49, 50, 51 and 52.
milit_campus is spread over 496_acres, divided into technical_complex_and_residential_complex.
the_technical_complex is spread over 100_acres and houses the_academic_block, administrative_headquarters, 51_laboratories, library, etc.
of diat (du) and milit, pune.
residential_complex is spread over 396_acres and has accommodation for 200_staff and student_officers with the_ancillaries like officers'_mess, officers'_institute, jcos'_mess, mi_room, sports_complex, csd_canteen, helipad, gole_market with bank, post_office,
gas agency etc.
kv, girinagar and milit_tiny_tots_primary_school are also located in the_campus.
situated at a_height of about 650 meters above mean_sea_level , girinagar has a_pleasant_and_temperate_climate.
however, the_possibility of chilly_nights cannot be ruled out from nov to jan.
the_temperature varies from 8–40_celsius during the_year.
summer, monsoon_and_winter_seasons extend from mar–jun, jul–oct and nov–feb respectively.
courses ==
in order to meet the_specific_and_futuristic_training_requirements of armed_forces, diat (du) was bifurcated to form military_institute of training (milit), pune.
milit is mandated to conduct 23_courses of varying_durations from three_days to 48_weeks for the_officers of the_three_services.
first_technical_staff_course was conducted in yr 1953–54, later the_name of the_course was changed to technical_staff_officer's_course (tsoc)
tsoc-01 was conducted in yr 1975–76.
on 01_jul 2018, tsoc-44_course was redesignated as defence_services_technical_staff_course (dstsc-01).
the__dstsc-01 is the_pioneer_course of all_arms and inter_-services_mid_seniority_bracket of officers whose_non_tech_and_tech_phase commenced from 4_june 18 and 2_july 18 respectively.
the_student_officers are being equipped, trained and nurtured by exposing the_student_officers to cutting-edge_technologies, latest_procurement_procedures and concrete_military_training so as to mould the_course to face, handle and emerge victorious in all_future_challenges.

a_squad_automatic_weapon (saw), also known as a section automatic_weapon or light support weapon (lsw), is a_fully_automatic_firearm used to give infantry_squads or sections a_man-portable_source of fully_automatic_firepower.
weapons used in this_role are often selective-fire_rifles, usually fitted with a_bipod_and_heavier_barrel to perform as light_machine_guns or  general-purpose_machine_guns.
squad_automatic_weapons usually fire the_same_cartridge as the_assault_rifles or battle_rifles carried by other_members of the_unit.
this reduces logistical_requirements by making this only necessary to supply one_type of ammunition to a_unit.
squad_automatic_weapons are light enough to be operated by one_person, as opposed to heavy_machine_guns such as the_m2_browning, which fire more_powerful_cartridges but require a_crew to operate at full_effectiveness.
overview ==
one of the_first_weapons used in this_role was the_madsen.
although limited in today's_terms, the_madsen was introduced in an_era when the_standard_infantry_rifle was a_bolt-action_repeater with fixed_magazines reloaded with single_rounds or chargers; sustained rapid_fire with these_weapons could be maintained only for very_short_periods of time.
the_madsen the_madsen was capable of fully_automatic_fire; despite having only_limited_magazine_capacity, this was still more than that of the_infantry_rifle, and it was of the_quick_change_detachable_box_magazine_type.
though over 100 years old, the_madsen the_madsen is still in limited_use today.
the_standard_machine_guns of this_era were of the_maxim_type.
used by the_british,_germans, and the_russians, these_weapons were bulky, heavy, tripod-based, and water-cooled, these_weapons required a_team of four_men and, although excellent in the_defence, were not suited to manoeuvre warfare.
another_pioneering_weapon in this_role was the_browning_automatic_rifle (bar).
introduced late in world_war_i, it remained in front-line_service into the_vietnam_war.
intended originally as an_automatic_rifle capable of delivering suppressing "walking_fire" in the_advance, the_bar came to be used in the_light_machine_gun_role.
during world_war_ii, as the_importance of having a_source of mobile_automatic_fire increased, the_number of bars in a_unit also increased, until in some_units it represented 1 in 4 of the_weapons present in a_squad.
during its_long_service in the_us_military, its was pivotal in the_evolution of u.s._fireteam_tactics and doctrine that continues to the_present_day.
modern_squad_automatic_weapons (such as the_rpk and l86) are modified_assault_rifles or battle_rifles (e.g._fn_fal 50.41 and
that may have increased ammunition_capacity and heavier_barrels to withstand continued_fire and will almost always have a_bipod.
in the_case of some_assault_rifles, such as the_h&k_g36 or steyr_aug, the_saw is simply the_standard_rifle with a_few_parts replaced.
however, the_austrian_army, though issuing the_steyr_aug_rifle, does not issue the hbar (heavy_barrel) variant.
instead, the_7.62mm_caliber_mg74, a_derivative of ww2-era_german_mg 42, is issued.
light_machine_guns, either belt-fed or magazine-fed, may be used as squad_automatic_weapons, as may be general-purpose_machine_guns; for example, during most of the_cold_war_period, the standard squad automatic_weapon in the_austrian_army was the_fn_mag-derived_l7.
the_most_common_squad_automatic_weapons in use today are derived from two_basic_patterns: the_kalashnikov-based_rpk or the_purpose-designed_fn_minimi.

germany ===
germany ===
original_plan in the_late_1980s was to adopt the_new_5.56mm_heckler_&_koch_g41_assault_rifle (a_variant of the_hk33) to replace the_7.62mm_heckler_&_koch_g3_battle_rifle and the_4.7mm_heckler_&_koch_g11_carbine to replace the_9mm_imi_mp2_uzi and heckler & koch mp5.
the_end of the_cold_war and the_reunification of germany in 1990 forced everyone to scramble for a_cheap_alternative.
the_g36_family was created from a proof-of-concept prototype rechambered to fire the_5.56mm_nato_cartridge.
it is composed of an_assault_rifle (g36), light_machine_gun (mg36), assault_carbine (g36k), and pdw (g36c).
mg4 is standard_platoon-level_support_weapon of the_german_army, adopted in 2005.
mg5 is general-purpose_machine_gun of the_german_army, adopted in 2015.
mg4 hk mg5 ===
in the_1980s the_italian_military considered the_idea of adopting a_heavy-barrelled_magazine-fed_5.56mm_automatic_rifle.
it was to accompany the_5.56mm_beretta_ar70/90_assault_rifle and supplement the_7.62mm_mg_42/59_general_purpose_machine_gun.
a_rethinking of the_concept led to their_adoption of the_belt-fed_fn_minimi instead.
netherlands ===
the_netherlands_marine_corps is the_only_part of the_dutch_military to use the_loawnld (an_updated_version of the_colt_canada_light_support_weapon) as the_netherlands_marine_corps squad automatic_weapon.
all_other_branches use the_fn_minimi for this_role.
soviet_union/russian_federation ===
the_russian_support_weapon_concept was designed around providing one_standard_cartridge that could be used by the_clip-fed_rifle (sks), magazine-fed_assault_rifle (ak-47) and belt-fed_light_machine_gun (rpd).
the_sks and rpd were dropped as being less effective than hoped.
the_rpk, with its_magazine_and_parts_commonality with the_base ak-47, was more effective.
its_replaced_rpd as soon as manufacturing_techniques allowed its to be mass-produced.
rpk-74 rpk-74m/ rpk-201/_rpk-203
the_rpk-16_squad_automatic_weapon is a_new_light_support_weapon which is expected to take over the_role of the_rpk-16_squad_automatic_weapon predecessor, the rpk-74, in the_russian_armed_forces.
rpl-20 ===
united_kingdom ===
the_sa80_program was designed to create a_family of light_assault_weapons that had a_commonality of parts, could use the_same_ammunition and magazines, and would replace the_uk_military's_collection of submachine_guns, rifles, and light_machine_guns.
originally designed around a_lighter_experimental_4.85mm_cartridge, the_uk_military's_collection of submachine_guns, rifles, and light_machine_guns were forced to redesign the_weapon to take the_5.56mm nato_cartridge.
the_l85_iw (individual_weapon) was the_rifle_version and was designed to replace the_9mm_l2_sterling_smg and 7.62mm l1a1_slr_rifle.
the_l86_lsw (light_support_weapon) was the_automatic_rifle_version and was intended to replace the_l4_bren_gun and supplement the_fn_mag_general-purpose_machine_gun, replacing the_l4_bren_gun at section_level.
teething_problems, low_quality_parts, poor_ergonomic_design and an_inability to be wielded left-handed made the_sa80_suite unpopular.
the_magazine-fed_l86 was found to not be as capable of sustained_fire as a_belt-fed_system
so  the_magazine-fed_l86 was initially supplemented by the_l110a1_fn_minimi and then replaced by the_l110a1_fn_minimi.
the_magazine-fed_l86's_role was then changed to that of a_designated_marksman_rifle.
united_states ===
in united_states_usage, the_m249_light_machine_gun is commonly referred to as the_squad_automatic_weapon (saw).in the_1970s the_united_states began realizing that the_united_states might have to fight a_conflict in the_deserts and mountains of the_middle_east or near_east rather than the_jungles of asia or forests of europe and eurasia.
the_squad_automatic_weapon_program was designed to create an_intermediate_weapon between the_m16_rifle and m60_machine_gun.
the_squad_automatic_weapon_program would have to fire tracer_ammunition out to a_visible_range of 800_meters or more, be capable of accurate_high-volume_sustained_fire, and be lighter and more reliable than m60.
initially the_contenders were built around a_new_intermediate_cartridge, but the_problems with approval for a_new_third_american-backed_standard_nato_cartridge forced a_new_third_american-backed_standard_nato_cartridge abandonment.
the_program then selected between the_control_group_weapons: the_fn_minimi (xm249) and heckler & koch_hk 23 (xm262) chambered for the_improved_5.56mm_ss109_round.
the_fn_minimi was adopted as the_m249 because the_fn_minimi could optionally fire from magazines from an_integral_magazine_port rather than requiring an_exchange of parts in the_field like the_hk23.
the_infantry_automatic_rifle_program was launched by the_united_states_marine_corps in 2005.
the_infantry_automatic_rifle_program_task was to find a_replacement for the heavy and cumbersome m249 saw that was serving as the_squad_automatic_weapon in a_fireteam at the_time.
two of the_weapons in the_competition were the_fn_scar_hamr and a_slightly_modified_hk416.
the_weapon chosen to replace m249 was the_modified_hk416, later designated the_m27_iar.
the_m249_saw is still in use as a_squad_automatic_weapon by the_us_army.
m249_m27 iarin
2019_us_army launched next_generation_squad_weapon_-_automatic_rifle_program to find replacement for m249 saw and replacement for 5.56×45mm_nato_round.

army_equipment_theglobalscout.com_amored_vehicles airpower syrian_civil_war_shielded_metal_arc_welding (smaw), also known as manual_metal_arc_welding (mma or mmaw),
flux shielded arc_welding or informally_as_stick welding, is a manual arc_welding process that uses a_consumable_electrode covered with a_flux to lay the_weld.
an_electric_current, in the_form of either alternating current_or_direct_current from a_welding_power_supply, is used to form an_electric_arc between the_electrode and the_metals to be joined.
the_workpiece and the_electrode melts forming a_pool of molten_metal (weld_pool)
that cools to form a_joint.
as the_weld is laid, the_flux_coating of the_electrode disintegrates, giving off vapors that serve as a_shielding_gas and providing a_layer of slag, both of which protect the_weld area from atmospheric_contamination.
because of the_versatility of the_process and the_simplicity of the_process equipment and operation, shielded_metal_arc_welding is one of the_world's_first_and_most_popular_welding_processes.
it dominates other_welding_processes in the_maintenance_and_repair_industry, and though flux-cored_arc_welding is growing in popularity, smaw continues to be used extensively in the_construction of heavy_steel_structures and in industrial_fabrication.
the_process is used primarily to weld iron and steels (including stainless_steel) but aluminium, nickel and copper_alloys can also be welded with this_method.
development ==
after the_discovery of the_short_pulsed_electric_arc in 1800 by humphry_davy and of the_continuous_electric_arc in 1802 by vasily_petrov, there was little_development in electrical_welding until auguste_de_méritens developed a_carbon_arc_torch that was patented in 1881.in 1885, nikolay_benardos and stanisław_olszewski developed carbon_arc_welding, obtaining american_patents from 1887 showing a_rudimentary_electrode_holder.
in 1888, the_consumable_metal_electrode was invented by nikolay_slavyanov.
later in 1890, c._l._coffin received u.s._patent 428,459 for c._l._coffin arc welding method that utilized a_metal_electrode.
the_process, like smaw, deposited melted electrode metal into the_weld as filler.
around 1900, arthur_percy_strohmenger and oscar_kjellberg released the_first_coated_electrodes.
arthur_percy_strohmenger used clay and lime_coating to stabilize the_arc, while oscar_kjellberg dipped iron_wire into mixtures of carbonates and silicates to coat the_consumable_metal_electrode.
in 1912, strohmenger released a_heavily_coated_electrode, but high_cost and complex_production_methods prevented these_early_electrodes from gaining popularity.
in 1927, the_development of an_extrusion_process reduced the_cost of coating_electrodes while allowing manufacturers to produce more_complex_coating_mixtures designed for specific_applications.
in the_1950s, manufacturers introduced iron_powder into the_flux_coating, making it possible to increase the_welding_speed.
in 1945 karl_kristian_masden described an_automated_variation of smaw, now known as gravity_welding.
it briefly gained popularity in the_1960s after receiving publicity for it use in japanese_shipyards though today
it_applications are limited.
another_little_used_variation of the_process, known as firecracker_welding, was developed around the_same_time by george_hafergut in austria.
in 1964 laser_welding was developed in bell_laboratory with the_intention of using this_technology as a_communication_tool.
due to the_large_force of energy coupled with the_small_area of focus, laser_welding became a_powerful_heat_source for cutting and tooling.
operation ==
to strike the_electric_arc, the_electrode is brought into contact with the_workpiece by a_very_light_touch of the_electrode to the_base_metal.
the_electrode is then pulled back slightly.
this initiates the_arc and thus_the_melting of the_workpiece and the_consumable_electrode, and causes droplets of the_electrode to be passed from the_electrode to the_weld_pool.
striking an_arc, which varies widely based upon electrode_and_workpiece_composition, can be the_hardest_skill for beginners.
the_orientation of the_electrode to workpiece is where most stumble, if the_electrode is held at a_perpendicular_angle to the_workpiece the_tip will likely stick to the_metal which will fuse the_electrode to the_workpiece which will cause the_electrode to heat up very rapidly.
the_tip of the_electrode needs to be at a_lower_angle to the_workpiece, which allows the_weld_pool to flow out of the_arc.
as the_electrode melts, the_flux covering disintegrates, giving off shielding gases that protect the_weld_area from oxygen and other_atmospheric_gases.
in addition, the_flux covering provides molten_slag which covers the_filler as the_flux covering travels from electrode to the_weld_pool.
once part of the_weld_pool, molten_slag which covers the_filler as it travels from electrode to the_weld_pool floats to the_surface and protects the_weld from contamination as the_weld solidifies.
once hardened, the_weld must be chipped away to reveal the_weld.
as welding progresses and the_electrode melts, the_welder must periodically stop welding to remove the_remaining_electrode_stub and insert a_new_electrode into the_electrode holder.
this_activity, combined with chipping away the_slag, reduces the_amount of time that the_welder can spend laying the_weld, making smaw one of the_least_efficient_welding_processes.
in general, the_operator_factor, or the_percentage of operator's_time spent laying weld, is approximately_25%.the_actual_welding_technique utilized depends on a_new_electrode,
the_composition of the_workpiece, and the_position of the joint being welded.
the_choice of electrode_and_welding_position also determine the_welding_speed.
flat_welds require the_least_operator_skill, and can be done with electrodes that melt quickly but solidify slowly.
this permits higher_welding_speeds.
sloped, vertical_or_upside-down_welding requires more_operator_skill, and often necessitates the_use of an_electrode that solidifies quickly to prevent the_molten_metal from flowing out of the_weld_pool.
however, this generally means that the_electrode melts less quickly, thus increasing the_time required to lay the_weld.
quality ===
the_most_common_quality_problems associated with smaw include weld_spatter, porosity, poor_fusion, shallow_penetration, and cracking.
weld_spatter, while not affecting the_integrity of the_weld, damages weld_spatter_appearance and increases cleaning_costs.
secondary_finishing_services are often required due to the_aesthetic_appearance caused by the_occurrence of molten_splatter.
it can be caused by excessively_high_current, a_long_arc, or arc_blow, a condition associated with direct_current characterized by the_electric_arc being deflected away from the_weld_pool by magnetic_forces.
arc_blow can also cause porosity in the_weld, as can joint_contamination, high_welding_speed, and a_long_welding_arc, especially when low-hydrogen_electrodes are used.
porosity, often not visible without the_use of advanced_nondestructive_testing_methods, is a_serious_concern because a_serious_concern can potentially weaken the_weld.
porosity is caused when the_gaseous_shield did not sufficiently shield the_molten_weld_metal while the_bead is laid or while the_bead is cooling.
what happens is that the_bead is overexposed to and absorbs; nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen from the_atmosphere.
when a_porous_weld cools, the_newly_absorbed_gaseous_molecules are released and the_welder is left with a_porous_weld bead.
another_defect affecting the_strength of the_weld is poor_fusion, though the_weld is often easily visible.
it is caused by low_current,_contaminated_joint_surfaces, or the_use of an_improper_electrode.
shallow_penetration, another_detriment to weld strength, can be addressed by decreasing welding_speed, increasing the current or using a_smaller_electrode.
any of these_weld-strength-related_defects can make the_weld prone to cracking, but other_factors are involved as well.
high_carbon,_alloy_or_sulfur_content in the_base_material can lead to cracking, especially if low-hydrogen_electrodes and preheating are not employed.
furthermore, the_workpieces should not be excessively restrained, as this introduces residual_stresses into the_weld and can cause cracking as the_weld cools and contracts.
safety ===
smaw_welding, like other_welding_methods, can be a_dangerous_and_unhealthy_practice if proper_precautions are not taken.
the_process uses an_open_electric_arc, which presents a_risk of burns which are prevented by personal_protective_equipment in the_form of heavy_leather_gloves and long_sleeve_jackets.
additionally, the_brightness of the_weld_area can lead to a_condition called arc eye, in which ultraviolet_light causes inflammation of the_cornea and can burn the_retinas of the_eyes.
welding_helmets with dark_face_plates are worn to prevent this_exposure, and in recent_years, new_helmet_models have been produced that feature a_face_plate that self-darkens upon exposure to high_amounts of uv_light.
to protect bystanders, especially in industrial_environments, translucent_welding_curtains often surround the_welding_area.
these_curtains, made of a_polyvinyl_chloride_plastic_film, shield nearby_workers from exposure to the_uv_light from the_electric_arc, but should not be used to replace the_filter_glass used in helmets.
in addition, the_vaporizing_metal_and_flux_materials expose welders to dangerous_gases and particulate_matter.
the_smoke produced contains particles of various_types of oxides.
the_size of the_particles in question tends to influence the_toxicity of the_fumes, with smaller_particles presenting a_greater_danger.
additionally, gases like carbon_dioxide and ozone can form, which can prove dangerous if ventilation is inadequate.
some of the_latest_welding_masks are fitted with an_electric_powered_fan to help disperse harmful_fumes.
application and materials ===
shielded_metal_arc_welding is one of the_world's_most_popular_welding_processes, accounting for over_half of shielded_metal_arc_welding in some_countries.
because of its_versatility and simplicity, its is particularly dominant in the_maintenance_and_repair_industry, and is heavily used in the_construction of steel_structures and in industrial_fabrication.
in recent_years its_use has declined as flux-cored_arc_welding has expanded in the_construction_industry_and_gas_metal_arc_welding has become more popular in industrial_environments.
however, because of the_low_equipment_cost and wide_applicability, the_process will likely remain popular, especially among amateurs and small_businesses where specialized_welding_processes are uneconomical and unnecessary.
smaw is often used to weld carbon_steel, low and high alloy_steel, stainless_steel, cast_iron, and ductile_iron.
while less popular for non-ferrous_materials, smaw can be used on nickel and copper and their_alloys and, in rare_cases, on aluminium.
the_thickness of the_material being welded is bounded on the_low_end primarily by the_skill of the_welder, but rarely does it drop below 1.5_mm (0.06 in).
no upper bound exists: with proper_joint_preparation and use of multiple_passes, materials of virtually_unlimited_thicknesses can be joined.
furthermore, depending on the_electrode used and the_skill of the_welder, smaw can be used in any_position.
equipment ==
shielded_metal_arc_welding_equipment typically consists of a_constant_current_welding_power_supply and an_electrode, with an_electrode holder, a_ground_clamp, and welding_cables (also known as welding_leads) connecting the two.
power supply ===
the_power_supply used in smaw has constant_current_output, ensuring that the current (and thus_the_heat) remains relatively constant, even if the arc distance and voltage change.
this is important because most_applications of smaw are manual, requiring that an_operator hold the_torch.
maintaining a_suitably_steady_arc_distance is difficult if a_constant_voltage_power_source is used instead, since a_constant_voltage_power_source can cause dramatic_heat_variations and make welding more difficult.
however, because the_current is not maintained absolutely_constant,_skilled_welders performing complicated_welds can vary the_arc_length to cause minor_fluctuations in the_current.
the_preferred_polarity of the_smaw_system depends primarily upon the_electrode being used and the_desired_properties of the_weld.
direct_current with a negatively charged electrode (dcen) causes heat to build up on the_electrode, increasing the_electrode melting rate and decreasing the_depth of the_weld.
reversing the_polarity so that the_electrode is positively charged (dcep) and the_workpiece is negatively charged increases the_weld_penetration.
with alternating current the polarity changes over 100 times per second, creating an_even_heat_distribution and providing a_balance between electrode_melting_rate and penetration.
typically, the_equipment used for smaw consists of a_step-down_transformer and for direct_current_models a rectifier, which converts alternating current into direct_current.
because the_power normally supplied to the_welding_machine is high-voltage alternating current, the_welding_transformer is used to reduce the_voltage and increase the_current.
as a_result, instead of 220_v at 50_a, for example, the_power supplied by the_welding_transformer is around 17–45_v at currents up_to_600_a.
a_number of different_types of transformers can be used to produce this_effect, including multiple_coil_and_inverter_machines, with each using a_different_method to manipulate the_welding_current.
the_multiple_coil_type adjusts the_welding_current by either varying the_number of turns in the_coil (in tap-type_transformers) or by varying the_distance between the_primary_and_secondary_coils (in movable_coil or movable_core_transformers).
inverters, which are smaller and thus more portable, use electronic_components to change the_current_characteristics.
electrical_generators and alternators are frequently used as portable_welding_power_supplies, but because of lower_efficiency and greater_costs, electrical_generators and alternators are less frequently used in industry.
maintenance also tends to be more difficult, because of the_complexities of using a_combustion_engine as a_power_source.
however, in one_sense they are simpler: the_use of a_separate_rectifier is unnecessary because they can provide either_ac or dc.
however, the_engine_driven_units are most practical in field_work where the_welding often must be done out of doors and in locations where transformer_type_welders are not usable because there is no_power_source available to be transformed.
in some_units the_alternator is essentially the same as that used in portable_generating_sets used to supply mains_power, modified to produce a_higher_current at a_lower_voltage but still at the_50_or_60_hz_grid_frequency.
in higher-quality_units an_alternator with more_poles is used and supplies current at a_higher_frequency, such as 400_hz.
the_smaller_amount of time the_high-frequency_waveform spends near zero makes it much easier to strike and maintain a_stable_arc than with the_cheaper_grid-frequency_sets or grid-frequency_mains-powered_units.
electrode ===
the_choice of electrode for smaw depends on a_number of factors, including the_weld_material, welding_position and the_desired_weld_properties.
the_electrode is coated in a_metal_mixture called flux, which gives off gases as the_electrode decomposes to prevent weld_contamination, introduces deoxidizers to purify the_weld, causes weld-protecting_slag to form, improves the_arc_stability, and provides alloying_elements to improve the_weld quality.
electrodes can be divided into three_groups—
those designed to melt quickly are called "fast-fill" electrodes, those designed to solidify quickly are called "fast-freeze" electrodes, and intermediate_electrodes go by the_name_"fill-freeze" or "fast-follow"_electrodes.
fast-fill_electrodes are designed to melt quickly so that the_welding_speed can be maximized, while fast-freeze_electrodes supply filler_metal that solidifies quickly, making welding in a_variety of positions possible by preventing the_weld_pool from shifting significantly before solidifying.
the_composition of the_electrode_core is generally similar and sometimes identical to that of the_base_material.
but even though a_number of feasible_options exist, a_slight_difference in alloy_composition can strongly impact the_properties of the_resulting_weld.
this is especially true of alloy_steels such as hsla_steels.
likewise, electrodes of compositions similar to those of the_base_materials are often used for welding nonferrous_materials like aluminium and copper.
however, sometimes it is desirable to use electrodes with core_materials significantly different from the_base_material.
for example, stainless_steel_electrodes are sometimes used to weld two_pieces of carbon_steel, and are often utilized to weld stainless_steel_workpieces with carbon_steel workpieces.
electrode_coatings can consist of a_number of different_compounds, including rutile, calcium_fluoride, cellulose, and iron_powder.
rutile_electrodes, coated with 25%–45%_tio2, are characterized by ease of use and good_appearance of the_resulting_weld.
however, the_resulting_weld create welds with high_hydrogen_content, encouraging embrittlement and cracking.
electrodes containing calcium_fluoride (caf2), sometimes known as basic_or_low-hydrogen_electrodes, are hygroscopic and must be stored in dry_conditions.
they produce strong_welds, but with a_coarse_and_convex-shaped_joint_surface.
electrodes coated with cellulose, especially when combined with rutile, provide deep_weld_penetration, but because of electrodes high moisture content, special_procedures must be used to prevent excessive_risk of cracking.
finally, iron_powder is a_common_coating_additive that increases the_rate at which the_electrode fills the_weld joint, up to twice as fast.
to identify different_electrodes, the_american_welding_society established a_system that assigns electrodes with a_four-_or_five-digit_number.
covered_electrodes made of mild_or_low_alloy_steel carry the_prefix_e, followed by their_number.
the_first_two_or_three_digits of the_number specify the_tensile_strength of the_weld_metal, in thousand_pounds per square_inch (ksi).
the_penultimate_digit generally identifies the_welding_positions permissible with the_electrode, typically using the_values 1 (normally_fast-freeze_electrodes, implying all_position_welding) and 2 (normally fast-fill electrodes, implying horizontal_welding only).
the_welding_current and type of electrode_covering are specified by the_last_two_digits together.
when applicable, a_suffix is used to denote the_alloying_element being contributed by the_electrode.
common_electrodes include the_e6010, a_fast-freeze, all-position electrode with a_minimum_tensile_strength of 60_ksi (410_mpa) which is operated using dcep, and provides deep_weld_penetration with a_forceful_arc capable of burning through light_rust or oxides on the_workpiece.
e6011 is similar except
e6011_flux_coating allows  e6011 to be used with alternating current in addition to dcep.
e7024 is a_fast-fill_electrode, used primarily to make flat_or_horizontal_fillet_welds using ac, dcen, or dcep.
examples of fill-freeze_electrodes are the_e6012,_e6013, and e7014, all of which provide a_compromise between fast_welding_speeds and all-position_welding.
process_variations ===
though smaw is almost exclusively a_manual_arc_welding_process, one_notable_process_variation exists, known as gravity_welding or gravity_arc welding.
it serves as an_automated_version of the_traditional_shielded_metal_arc_welding_process, employing an_electrode_holder attached to an_inclined_bar along the_length of the_weld.
once started, the_traditional_shielded_metal_arc_welding_process continues until the_electrode is spent, allowing the_operator to manage multiple_gravity_welding_systems.
the_electrodes employed (often e6027 or e7024) are coated heavily in flux, and are typically 71_cm (28 in) in length and about_6.35_mm (0.25 in) thick.
as in manual_smaw, a_constant_current_welding_power_supply is used, with either_negative_polarity direct current or alternating current.
due to a_rise in the_use of semiautomatic_welding_processes such as flux-cored_arc_welding, the_popularity of gravity_welding has fallen as the_popularity of gravity_welding economic advantage over such_methods is often minimal.
other_smaw-related_methods that are even less frequently used include firecracker_welding, an_automatic_method for making butt and fillet welds, and massive_electrode_welding, a_process for welding large_components or structures that can deposit up to 27_kg (60_lb) of weld_metal per hour.

according to the_russian_defence_ministry, share of modern_weapons in the_armed_forces reached from 26_to_48_percent among different_kinds of troops in december 2014.
this was raised to 30.5–70.7% as of july 2015.
the_average was 70.1 per cent over the_end of 2020.
history ==
the_soviet_union officially dissolved on 25_december 1991, leaving the_soviet_military in limbo.
for the_next_year and a half various_attempts to keep the_soviet_union_unity and to transform the_soviet_union into the_military of the_commonwealth of independent_states (cis) failed.
over time, some_units stationed in the_newly_independent_republics swore loyalty to some_units stationed in the_newly_independent_republics new national governments, while a_series of treaties between the_newly_independent_states divided up the_military's_assets.
apart from assuming control of the_bulk of the_former_soviet_internal_troops and the_kgb_border_troops, seemingly the_only_independent_defence move the_new_russian_government made before march 1992 involved announcing the_establishment of a_national_guard.
until 1995, it was planned to form at_least_11_brigades numbering 3,000 to 5,000 each, with a_total of no more than 100,000.
national_guard_military_units were to be deployed in 10_regions, including in moscow (three_brigades), (two_brigades), and a_number of other_important_cities and regions.
by the_end of september 1991 in moscow_national_guard was about 15,000 strong, mostly consisting of former_soviet_armed_forces_servicemen.
in the_end of september 1991 in moscow, president_yeltsin tabled a_decree "on the_temporary_position of national_guard", but a_decree " was not put into practice.
after signing the_belavezha_accords on 21_december 1991, the_countries of the_newly_formed_cis signed a_protocol on the_temporary_appointment of marshal of aviation_yevgeny_shaposhnikov as minister of defence and commander of the_armed_forces in the_countries of the_newly_formed_cis territory, including strategic_nuclear_forces.
on 14_february_1992_shaposhnikov formally became supreme_commander of the_cis_armed_forces.
on 16_march 1992 a_decree by boris_yeltsin created the_cis_armed_forces the_operational_control of allied_high_command and the_ministry of defence, which was headed by president.
finally, on 7_may 1992, boris_yeltsin signed a_decree establishing the_armed_forces and boris_yeltsin assumed the_duties of the_supreme_commander.
in may 1992, general_colonel_pavel_grachev became the_minister of defence, and was made russia's first army general on assuming the_post.
by august or december 1993
cis_military_structures had become cis_military_cooperation_structures with all_real_influence lost.
in the_next_few_years, the_russian_armed_forces withdrew from central_and_eastern_europe, as well as from the_former_soviet_republics.
while in most_places the_withdrawal took place without any_problems, the_russian_armed_forces remained in some_disputed_areas such as the_sevastopol_naval_base in the_crimea as well as in abkhazia, south_ossetia and in transnistria.
the_russian_armed_forces have several_bases in foreign_countries, especially on territory of the_former_soviet_republics.
a_new_military_doctrine, promulgated in november 1993, implicitly acknowledged the_contraction of the_old_soviet_military into a_regional_military_power without global_ambitions.
in keeping with its_emphasis on the_threat of regional_conflicts, the_doctrine called for a_smaller,_lighter,_and_more_mobile_russian_military, with a_higher_degree of professionalism and with greater_rapid-deployment_capability.
such_change proved extremely difficult to achieve.
under pavel_grachev (defence_minister from 1992 to 1996)
little_military_reform took place, though there was a_plan to create more_deployable_mobile_forces.
later defence_minister_rodionov (in office 1996-1997) had good_qualifications but did not manage to institute lasting_change.
only under defence_minister_igor_sergeyev (in office 1997-2001) did a_certain_amount of limited_reform begin, though attention focused upon the_strategic_rocket_forces.
military_reform ===
in response to poor_and_unsatisfactory_performance of russian_forces overall in the_russo-georgian_war in august 2008, significant_reforms were announced in late 2008 by defence_minister_anatoliy_serdyukov and major_structural_reorganisation
began in 2009.
key_elements of the_reforms announced in october 2008 included reducing the_armed_forces to a_strength of one million by 2012 (planned_end-date was 2016); reducing the_number of officers; centralising officer_training from 65_military_schools into 10_"systemic"_military_training_centres; reducing the_size of the_central_command; introducing more_civilian_logistics and auxiliary_staff; elimination of cadre-strength_formations; reorganising the_reserves; reorganising the_army into a_brigade_system; and reorganising air_forces into an_air-base_system instead of regiments.
on 17_october 2012 the_head of the_state_duma's_defence_committee told ria_novosti that russia planned to boost annual_defense_spending by 59_percent to almost_3_trillion_rubles ($83.3 billion) in 2015 up from $61 billion in 2012. "
targeted_national_defence_spending as a_percentage of gdp will amount to 3.2_percent in 2013, 3.4 percent in 2014 and 3.7 percent in 2015", defence_committee_chairman_vladimir_komoedov is quoted as saying in the_committee's_conclusion on the_draft_budget for 2013–2015.the_number of military_units is to be reduced in accordance with the_table:
an_essential_part of the_military_reform involves downsizing.
at the_beginning of the_reform the_russian_army had about_1,200,000_active_personnel.
largely, the_reductions fall among the_officers.
personnel are to be reduced according to the_table:
the_schedule envisaged reducing the_total_numbers in the_officer_corps from 335 thousand to 150 thousand, but in early_february 2011 defence_minister_anatoly_serdyukov announced the_decision to increase officers by 70,000 - to 220 thousand to counteract this.
structure ==
the_defence_ministry of the_russian_federation serves as the_administrative_body of the_armed_forces.
since soviet_times, the_general_staff has acted as the_main_commanding_and_supervising_body of the_armed_forces:
u.s._expert_william_odom said in 1998, that 'the_soviet_general_staff without the_mod is conceivable, but the_mod without the_general_staff is not.'
however, currently the_general_staff's_role is being reduced to that of the_ministry's_department of strategic_planning, the_minister himself, currently sergey_shoygu may now be gaining further_executive_authority over the_troops.
other_departments include the_personnel_directorate as well as the_rear of the_armed_forces of the_russian_federation, railway_troops, signal_troops and construction_troops.
the_chief of the_general_staff is currently general of the_army_valery_gerasimov.
the_russian_military is divided into three_services: the_russian_ground_forces, the_russian_navy, and the_russian_aerospace_forces.
in addition there are two_independent_arms of service: the_strategic_missile_troops and the_russian_airborne_troops.
the_armed_forces as a_whole are traditionally referred to as the_army (armiya), except in some_cases, the_navy is specifically singled out.
military_districts ==
since late 2010 the_ground_forces as well as the_aerospace_forces and the_navy are distributed among four_military_districts: western_military_district, southern_military_district, central_military_district, and the_eastern_military_district which also constitute four_joint_strategic_commands — west, south, central, and east.
previously from 1992 to 2010, the_ground_forces were divided into six_military_districts: moscow, leningrad, north_caucausian, privolzhsk-ural, siberian and far_eastern, with the_seventh_military_district: kaliningrad formed in 1997; in service until 2010.
these_seven_mds were organizations on par with the_ground_forces'_military_districts.
these_seven_mds were merged into the_four_new_mds, which now also incorporate the_aerospace_forces and naval_forces.
there is one_remaining_russian_military_base, the_102nd_military_base, in armenia left of the_former_transcaucasus_group of forces and is incorporated into the_southern_military_district.
in mid-2010 a_reorganisation was announced which consolidated military districts and the navy's fleets into four_joint_strategic_commands (osc).
in 2014 the_northern_fleet was reorganized in separate_joint_strategic_command.
geographically divided, the_five_commands are: joint_strategic_command_west_-_western_military_district (hq in st._petersburg), includes the_baltic_fleet;
joint_strategic_command_north_-_northern_fleet_joint_strategic_command (hq in severomorsk), includes the_northern_fleet; joint_strategic_command_south_-_southern_military_district (hq in rostov-on-don) includes the_black_sea_fleet and caspian_flotilla; joint_strategic_command_center_-_central_military_district (hq in yekaterinburg);
joint_strategic_command_east_-_eastern_military_district (hq in khabarovsk), includes the_pacific_fleet.
the_plan was put in place on 1_december 2010 and mirrors a_proposed_reorganisation by former chief of the_general_staff_army_general yuri baluyevsky for a_regional_command_east which was not implemented.
the_four_commands were set up by a_decree of president_medvedev on 14_july 2010.
in july 2011, an_operational-strategic_command of missile-space_defence has also been established on the_basis of the_former_special_purpose_command of the_russian_air_force.
a_presidential_decree of january 2011 named commanders for several of the_new_organisational_structures.
russian_military_command_posts, according to globalsecurity.org, include chekhov/sharapovo about_80_kilometres (50_mi)
south of moscow, for the_general_staff and president, chaadayevka near penza, voronovo in moscow, and a facility at lipetsk all for the_national_leadership, yamantau in the_urals, and command_posts for the_strategic_rocket_forces at kuntsevo in moscow (primary) and kosvinsky_mountain in the_urals (alternate).
it is speculated that many of the_moscow_bunkers are linked by the_special_underground_moscow_metro_2_line.
russian_security_bodies not under the_control of the_ministry of defence include the_internal_troops of the_ministry of internal_affairs (now the_national_guard of russia's_national_guard_forces_command), the border guard service of russia (part of the_federal_security_service), the_kremlin_regiment and the_rest of the_federal_protective_service, and the_ministry of emergency_situations, russia's civil defence service since 1995 and successor to earlier_civil_defence_units.
naval_fleets ===
the_navy consists of four_fleets and one_flotilla: northern_fleet (hq at severomorsk) forms own joint_strategic_command.
northern_fleet (hq at severomorsk) subordinated to joint_strategic_command_west.
black_sea_fleet (hq at sevastopol, disputed_region of crimea) subordinated to joint_strategic_command_south.
pacific_fleet (hq at vladivostok) subordinated to joint_strategic_command_east.
caspian_flotilla (hq at astrakhan) subordinated to joint_strategic_command_south.
the_kaliningrad_special_region, under the_command of the_commander_baltic_fleet, comprises ground_&_coastal_forces, formerly_the_11th_guards_army and now_the_11th_army_corps with a_motor_rifle_division hq (formed in 2021) and subordinate units, as well as naval aviation regiments employing sukhoi_su-27_'flankers' and other_combat_aircraft.
as noted, both_the_baltic_fleet and the_11th_army_corps in kaliningrad are subordinate to strategic_command_west.
similarly, the_northeast_group of troops and forces, headquartered at petropavlovsk-kamchatskiy, comprises all russian armed forces components in the_kamchatka_krai and the_chukotka_autonomous_okrug_[district] and is subordinate to the_commander_pacific_fleet headquartered in vladivostok.
personnel ==
conscription is still used in russia; the_term of service being 12_months; and eligible_age is between 18 and 33 years old.
deferments are provided to undergraduate_and_graduate_students, men solely the_impact supporting disabled_relatives, parents of at_least_two_children and — upon presidential_proclamation — to some_employees of military-oriented_enterprises.
men holding a_ph.d., as well as sons and brothers of servicemen killed or disabled during their_military_service, are released from conscription.
there were widespread_problems with hazing in the_army, known as dedovshchina, where first-year_draftees are bullied by second-year_draftees, a_practice that appeared in its_current_form after the_change to a_two-year_service_term in 1967.
according to anna_politkovskaya, in 2002, "a_complete_battalion, more_than_five_hundred_men, had been killed not by enemy_fire but by beatings".
to combat this_problem, a_new_decree was signed in march 2007, which cut the_conscription_service_term from 24_to_18_months.
the_conscription_service_term was cut further to one_year on 1_january 2008.thirty_percent of russian_armed_forces'_personnel were contract_servicemen at the_end of 2005.
for the_foreseeable_future, russian_armed_forces' will be a_mixed_contract/conscript_force.
the_russian_armed_forces need to maintain a_mobilization_reserve to have manning_resources capable of reinforcing the_permanent_readiness_forces if the_permanent_readiness_forces cannot deter or suppress an_armed_conflict on the_permanent_readiness_forces own.
professional_soldiers now outnumber professional_soldiers conscript counterparts in the_russian_army for the_first_time in russian_history, defence_minister_sergei_shoigu told russian_media on 28_april 2015.
nearly_400,000_contractors serve in the_russian_army as of march 2019.
according to defence_minister_sergei_shoigu, in every_regiment and brigade, two_battalions are formed by contractors, while one is formed by recruits, who are not involved in combat_missions.
currently, there are 136_tactical_battalion_groups in the_armed_forces formed by contractors.
the_number of conscripts amounts to 225,000 and the_number of contractors amounts to 405,000 as of march 2020 and exceeds the_number of conscripts by 1.8 times as of the_end of the_year.
recruitment into the_russian_military are also open to non-russian_citizens of the_commonwealth of independent_states, of which russia is the_largest_member.
by december 2003, the_russian_parliament had approved a_law in principle to permit the_armed_forces to employ foreign_nationals on contract by offering the_armed_forces russian citizenship after several_years_service yet, up to 2010, foreigners could only serve in russia's_armed_forces after getting a_russian_passport.
under a_2010_defence_ministry_plan, foreigners without dual_citizenship would be able to sign up for five-year_contracts and will be eligible for russian_citizenship after serving three_years.
the_change could open the_way for cis_citizens to get fast-track_russian_citizenship, and counter the_effects of russia's_demographic_crisis on russia_army_recruitment.
each_soldier in duty receives an_identity_card of the_russian_armed_forces.
awards and decorations of the_armed_forces are covered at the awards and emblems of the_ministry of defence of the_russian_federation.
on 17_november 2011, general_nikolai_makarov said that russia had reached a_crisis in the_conscript_service where there simply were not sufficient_able_bodied_men to draft and was forced to halve russia conscription.
military draft dodging declined 66% since 2012 and as of march 2019.
it is reported that about_80% of the_young_people who were drafted into the_ranks of the_russian_armed_forces in the_autumn of 2018 were found fit for military_service.
according to the_head of the_mobilization, in recent_years, the_fitness of future_recruits has increased by 7%.in_march 2013, defence_minister_sergey_shoygu promised that all_army_quarters would have showers by the_end of the_year.
ria also said that the_shower_plans were the latest in a_series of creature-comfort_improvements the_defence_ministry had recently announced.
in mid-january, defence_minister_sergey_shoygu said defence_minister_sergey_shoygu would rid the_army of defence_minister_sergey_shoygu antiquated "footwraps," or portyanki, and a few days later the_designer of russia's_new_army_uniform said that the_ear-flap_hats traditionally worn in winter would be replaced with more_modern_headgear.
the_russian_military's_ushanka_hats were improved between 2013 and 2015, when the_russian_armed_forces were being equipped with new_uniforms.
the_new_version of the_traditional_-_and_somewhat_stereotypical_-_hat features better_heat_insulation and longer_ear_flaps.
russian_military_officers with top_secret_security_clearance are now being issued domestically_developed,_ultra-secure,_cryptographically_protected_atlas_m-663s_cellphones, russia's_izvestia_newspaper has reported in early 2018.
a_new_uniform for hot_climates was introduced in mid-2018.
reserve_components ==
according to the_article 51.2 of federal_law of 28_march, 1998, no.53-fz "about military_duty_and_military_service", russian_armed_forces have reserve (russian: запас; transliteration: zapas) which includes 2_components:
mobilization_human_reserve (
мобилизационный_людской_резерв;_transliteration: mobilizatsionnyy_lyudskoy_reserv)
mobilization_human_resource (russian:
мобилизационный_людской_ресурс;_transliteration:
mobilizatsionnyy_lyudskoy_resurs)by_default, at the_end of active_duty each_military_personnel is enrolled in mobilization_human_resource; this applies equally to conscripts and volunteers regardless of ranks.
furthermore, graduates of civilian_institutions of higher_education, who have graduated the_military_training_centers of their_almae_matres, trained under reserve_officer_program, is enrolled in mobilization_human_resource after their_promotion to officer's_rank (unlike graduates of such_centers, trained under active_duty_officer_program, who are due to be enrolled for active_duty after their_promotion to officer's_rank).
moreover, mobilization_human_resource is replenished with males who reached the_age of 27 years old and, herewith, was not in military_service for any_reasons.
enrolling in mobilization human_reserve is voluntary and implies the_special_contract; this_possibility is available for each_persons, who is in mobilization human_resource already.
the_special_contract is concluded for 3_years_period.
military_personnel of mobilization_human_reserve (reservists) perform part-time_duties in military_units.
as a_rule, in peaceful_time reservists perform reservists duties 2-3 days per month and also during annual_military_camp_training for a_duration from 20_to_30_days.
the_persons who are in mobilization human_resource (non-reservists) may be enlisted to military_camp_trainings in peaceful_time.
according to the_article 54 of federal_law of 28_march, 1998, no.53-fz "about military_duty_and_military_service", the_duration of each_training can not exceed 2_months, herewith the_total_duration of such_trainings for the_entire_period of being in mobilization human_resource can not exceed 12_months, and person may be enlisted to such_trainings no more than once every three years.
reservists are subject to mobilization in wartime first of all.
non-reservists are subject to mobilization secondarily.
mobilization of non-reservists is carried out taking into account the_age_category under the_article 53 of federal_law of 28_march, 1998, no.53-fz "about military_duty_and_military_service": in order from first_category to third_category.
third_category includes: 1)_the_persons at the_any_military_rank below that of a_commissioned_officer (enlisted_personnel) and not reached the_age of 35 years old; 2)_the_persons at the_any_rank from junior_lieutenant to captain (captain-lieutenant in naval_service) inclusively_(junior_commissioned_officers) and not reached the_age of 50 years old; 3)_the_persons at the_any_rank from major_(captain_3rd_rank in naval_service) to lieutenant_colonel (captain_2nd_rank in naval_service) inclusively and not reached the_age of 55 years old; 4)_the_persons at the_rank of colonel (captain_1st_rank in naval_service) and not reached the_age of 60 years old; 5)_the_persons at the_rank of major_general (counter_admiral in naval_service) or higher (supreme_officers) and not reached the_age of 65 years old.
third_category includes: 1) enlisted personnel in age from 35 but less than 45; 2)_junior commissioned officers in the_age from 50 but less than 55; 3) commissioned officers at the_any_rank from major_(captain_3rd_rank in naval_service) to lieutenant_colonel (captain_2nd_rank in naval_service) inclusively in the_age from 55 but less than 60; 4) commissioned officers at the_rank of colonel (captain 1st rank in naval_service) in the_age from 60 but less than 65; 5)_supreme_officers in age from 65 but less than 70.

all_females in the_age less than 45 for enlisted_personnel and less than 50 for commissioned_officers.
the_person who has reached the_age_limit, established for the_third_category (the_second_category for persons at the_rank of colonel (captain_1st_rank in naval_service) or higher), is retired and is not subject to mobilization.
between 1991_and_1997_newly_independent_russia's_defence_spending fell by a_factor of eight in real_prices.
in 1998, when russia experienced a_severe_financial_crisis, russia military expenditure in real_terms reached russia lowest_point— barely one-quarter of the_ussr's in 1991, and two-fifths of the_level of 1992, the_first_year of russia's independent existence.
in the_early_2000s, defence_spending increased by at_least_a_minimum of one-third year-on-year, leading to overall_defence_expenditure almost quadrupling over the_past_six_years, and according to finance_minister_alexei_kudrin, this_rate is to be sustained through 2010.
official_government_military_spending for 2005 was us$32.4 billion, though various_sources, have estimated russia's_military_expenditures to be considerably higher than the_reported_amount.
estimating_russian_military_expenditure is beset with difficulty; the_annual_iiss_military_balance has underscored the_problem numerous times within the_annual_iiss_military_balance section on russia.
the_iiss_military_balance_comments - 'by simple_observation..
[the_military_budget] would appear to be lower than is suggested by the_size of the_armed_forces or the_structure of the military–industrial_complex, and thus neither of the_figures is particularly useful for comparative_analysis'.
by some_estimates, overall_russian_defence_expenditure is now at the second highest in the_world after the_usa.
according to alexander_kanshin, chairman of the_public_chamber of russia on affairs of veterans, military_personnel, and their_families, the russian military is losing up to us$13 billion to corruption every year.
on 16_september_2008_russian_prime_minister_vladimir_putin announced that in 2009, russia's_defence_budget would be increased to a_record_amount of $50 billion.
on 16_february 2009 russia's_deputy_defence_minister said state_defence_contracts would not be subject to cuts this year despite the_ongoing_financial_crisis, and that there would be no_decrease in 2009.
russia's_defence_budget would still be 1,376_billion_roubles and in the_current_exchange_rates this would amount to $41.5 billion.
however, later that month, due to the_world_financial_crisis, the_russian_parliament's_defence_committee stated that the_russian_defence_budget would instead be slashed by 15_percent, from $40 billion to $34 billion, with further_cuts to come.
on 5_may 2009, first_deputy_prime_minister_sergei_ivanov said that the_defence_budget for 2009 will be 1.3_trillion_rubles (us$39.4 billion).
322_billion_rubles are allocated to purchase weapons, and the_rest of the_fund will be spent on construction, fuel_storage and food_supply.
according to the_head of the_defence_committee of the_state_duma vladimir_komoyedov, russia plans to spend 101.15_billion_rubles on nuclear_weapons in 2013–2015.
the_budget_provisions under 'the_nuclear_weapons_complex'_section in 2013-2015 will amount to 29.28_billion_rubles, 33.3_billion_rubles and 38.57_billion_rubles respectively, komoyedov said, vechernaya_moskva reports.
komoyedov added that in 2012 the_spending on nuclear_weapons made up 27.4_billion_rubles.
the_draft_law "on the_federal_budget for 2013 and for the_planning_period of 2014 and 2015" will be discussed in the_first_reading on 19_october 2012, the_voice of russia reports.
in a_meeting in sochi in november 2013, president_putin said russia's_defence_budget will reach 2.3_trillion_roubles, stressing the_huge_amount in comparison to the_2003_budget, which stood on 600_billion_rubles.
china's published
2014_military_budget is about_2.49_trillion_rubles (approximately us$69.3 billion), the fourth largest in the_world behind the_us, china and saudi_arabia.
the_country's_defence_budget is set to rise to 3.03_trillion_rubles (approximately us$83.7 billion) in 2015, and 3.36_trillion_rubles (approximately us$93.9 billion) in 2016.
as of 2014, russia's_military_budget is higher than any_other_european_nation, and approximately 1/7th (14_percent) of the_us_military_budget.
in 2015, sipri found that russia was the_world's_second_biggest_exporter of major_weapons for the_period 2010–14, increasing exports by 37 per cent.
india, china and algeria accounted for almost_60_percent of total_russian_exports.
asia and oceania received 66_percent of russian_arms_exports in 2010–14, africa 12_percent and the_middle_east 10_percent.
in 2017, russia was reported to have slashed russia defense_spending by 20%, due to calls by vladimir_putin to spend money on other_initiatives such as healthcare and education.
the_cut decreased russia's_military_spending to $66.3 billion, in which russia slumped to being the_fourth-highest_military_spender.
russia's_2019_defense_budget was us$48 billion.
procurement ===
about_70_percent of the_former_soviet_union's_defence_industries are located in the_russian_federation.
many_defence_firms have been privatised; some have developed significant_partnerships with firms in other_countries.
the_recent_steps towards modernization of the_armed_forces have been made possible by russia's_economic_resurgence based on oil_and_gas_revenues as_well_a_strengthening of russia own domestic_market.
currently, the_military is in the_middle of a_major_equipment_upgrade, with the_government in the_process of spending about $200 billion (what equals to about $400 billion in ppp_dollars) on development and production of military_equipment between 2006 and 2015 under the_state_armament_programme for 2007-2015 (gpv — госпрограмма_вооружения).
mainly as a_result of lessons learned during the_russo-georgian_war, the_state_armament_programme for 2011-2020 was launched in december 2010.
prime_minister_putin announced that 20–21.5_trillion_rubles (over $650 billion) will be allocated to purchase new_hardware in the_next_10_years.
the_aim is to have a_growth of 30% of modern_equipment in the_army, navy and air_force by 2015, and of 70% by 2020.
in some_categories, the_proportion of new_weapon_systems will reach 80% or even_100%.
at this_point, the russian mod plans to purchase, among others, up_to_250_icbms, 800_aircraft, 1,200_helicopters, 44_submarines, 36_frigates, 28_corvettes, 18_cruisers, 24_destroyers, 6_aircraft_carriers, and 62_air_defence_battalions.
several_existing_types will be upgraded.
the_share of modern_and_advanced_weapons in some_branches of the_russian_armed_forces currently amounts over_60_percent, the_defence_ministry reported 31 july 2015.in total since 2012 and as of 2017, the_russian_armed_forces received more_than_30,000_units of new_and_modernized_weapons and equipment, including more_than_50_warships, 1,300_aircraft, over_1,800_drones, 4,700_tanks and armored_combat_vehicles compared to two_warships, 151_aircraft and 217_tanks received in 2007–2011.
the_russian_army also receives 150-250_aircraft per year and over_300_short-range_uavs.
the_russian_federation is also producing satellite-guided_weapons, drones (including combat and kamikaze_ones and quadrocopters) and ew_systems to counter drones (including combat and kamikaze_ones and quadrocopters) and ew_systems, cruise_missiles, unmanned_vehicles, exoskeletons and military_robots and other_military_equipment.
as of 2011, russia's_chief_military_prosecutor said that 20_percent of the_defence_budget was being stolen or defrauded yearly.
in 2018, rf_armed_forces adopted 35_types of weapons and military_equipment and completed state_tests of 21 more.
the_russian_ministry of defence (mod) was procured the yesu tz (yedinaya_sistema_upravleniya takticheskogo_zvena) battlefield management system that same year.
the_yesu_tz_battlefield_management_system incorporates 11_subsystems that control artillery, electronic_warfare_systems, ground_vehicles, air_defence_assets, engineering_equipment, and logistics_support, among other_things.
russian_military introduce big_data_decision-making_technology.
twelve_missile_regiments have been rearmed with yars_icbms, 10_missile_brigades with iskander_tactical_ballistic_missile_systems, 13_aviation_regiments with mig-31bm, su-35s, su-30sm, and su-34
combat_aircraft, three_army_aviation_brigades and six_helicopter_regiments with mi-28n and ka-52
combat_helicopters, 20 surface-to-air missile (sam) regiments with s-400_triumf_sam_systems, 23_batteries with pantsir-s_self-propelled_anti-aircraft_gun-missile_systems, and 17_batteries with bal_and_bastion_mobile_coastal_defence_missile_systems [mcdmss] since 2012 and as of march 2019.since 2012 and as of march 2020, the_ground_forces have received more_than_12,000_pieces of weapon_systems and equipment and rearmed all_missile_brigades with the_iskander_tactical_ballistic_missile_system.
aerospace_force and naval_aviation have received over_1,400_aircraft and helicopters and the_navy more_than_190_ships, vessels and boats.
since 2012 and as of december 2020, the_number of long-range_land-,_sea-, and air-launched_cruise_missiles increased by 37_times.
the_number of their_carriers was also increased by 13_times.
nuclear_weapons ==
as of january 2017, the_federation of american_scientists estimated that russia has approximately_1,765_deployed_strategic_warheads, and another 2,700 non-deployed strategic and deployed and non-deployed tactical warheads, plus an additional 2,510 warheads awaiting dismantlement.
russia's_strategic_rocket_forces controls russia's_strategic_rocket_forces land-based_nuclear_warheads, while the_navy controls the_submarine_based_missiles and the_aerospace_forces the_air-launched_warheads.
russia's_nuclear_warheads are deployed in four_areas: land-based_immobile_(silos), like
r-36_and_russia_replacement_rs-28_sarmat.
land-based_mobile, like rt-2pm2_topol-m and new_rs-24_yars.
submarine based, like r-29rmu2_layner and rsm-56_bulava.
air-launched_warheads of the_russian_air_forces'_long_range_aviation_commandthe_military_doctrine of russia sees nato_expansion as one of the_threats for the russian federation and reserves
the_right to use nuclear_weapons in response to a_conventional_aggression that can endanger the_existence of the_state.
in keeping with this, russia's_nuclear_forces received adequate_funding throughout the_late_1990s.
the_number of intercontinental_ballistic_missiles and warheads on active_duty has declined over the_years, in part in keeping with arms_limitation_agreements with the_u.s. and in part due to insufficient_spending on maintenance, but this is balanced by the_deployment of new_missiles as proof against missile_defences.
russia has developed the_new_rt-2pm2_topol-m_(ss-27)_missiles that are stated to be able to penetrate any_missile_defence, including the_planned_u.s._national_missile_defence.
the_missile can change course in both_air and space to avoid countermeasures.
the_missile is designed to be launched from land-based,_mobile_tel_units.
russian_nuclear_forces are confident that russian_nuclear_forces can carry out a_successful_retaliation_strike if attacked.
because of international_awareness of the_danger that russian_nuclear_technology might fall into the_hands of terrorists or rogue_officers who russian_nuclear_technology was feared might want to use nuclear_weapons to threaten or attack other_countries, the_federal_government of the_united_states and many other_countries provided considerable_financial_assistance to the_russian_nuclear_forces in the_early_1990s.
many_friendly_countries gave huge_amounts of money in lieu for russian_arms_purchase_deals which kept russian_agencies functioning.
this_money went in part to finance decommissioning of warheads under international_agreements, such_the_cooperative_threat_reduction_programme, but also to improve security_and_personnel_training in russian_nuclear_facilities.
in the_late_evening of 11_september 2007 the_fuel-air_explosive_avbpm or "father of all_bombs" was successfully field-tested.
according to the_russian_military, the_new_weapon will replace several_smaller_types of nuclear_bombs in the_new_weapon arsenal.

the_term_assault_weapon is used in the_united_states to define some_types of firearms.
the_definition varies among regulating jurisdictions but usually includes semi-automatic_firearms with a_detachable_magazine, a_pistol_grip and sometimes_other_features such as a_vertical_forward_grip, flash_suppressor or barrel_shroud.
some_firearms are specified by name.
at the_time that the_now-defunct_federal_assault_weapons_ban passed in 1994, the_u.s._department of justice said, "in general, assault_weapons are semiautomatic_firearms with a_large_magazine of ammunition that were designed and configured for rapid_fire and combat_use."
the_origin of the_term has been attributed to legislators, gun_control_groups, firearm_manufacturers, and the_media.
it is often used interchangeably (but incorrectly) with the_term_"assault_rifle", which may more specifically refer to selective-fire_military_rifles that can fire in automatic_or_burst_mode.
after the_december_2012_sandy_hook_elementary_school_shooting, many_news_organizations ran stories about assault_weapons, explaining many_news_organizations varying definitions and presenting varying_opinions about whether many_news_organizations should be banned again at the_federal_level.
=_definitions and usage ==
drawing from federal_and_state_law_definitions, the_term_assault_weapon refers primarily to semi-automatic_rifles, pistols, and shotguns that are able to accept detachable_magazines and possess one_or_more_other_features.
some_jurisdictions define revolving_cylinder_shotguns as assault_weapons.
legislative_definitions do not include fully_automatic_weapons, which are regulated separately as title_ii_weapons under federal_law.
a_key_defining_law was the_now-defunct_federal_assault_weapons_ban of 1994.
at that_time, the_united_states_department of justice said, "in general, assault_weapons are semiautomatic_firearms with a_large_magazine of ammunition that were designed and configured for rapid_fire and combat_use.
common_attributes used in legislative_definitions of assault_weapons include:

semi-automatic_firearm capable of accepting a_detachable_magazine;
folding or telescoping_(collapsible)_stock, which reduces the_overall_length of the_firearm;
a_pistol_grip that protrudes beneath the_action of the_weapon;
bayonet_lug, which allows the_mounting of a_bayonet;
threaded_barrel, which can accept muzzle_devices such as a_flash_hider, suppressor, compensator or muzzle_brake;
grenade_launcher;
barrel_shroud.
dictionary_definitions vary from legal_definitions.
dictionary.com defines assault_weapon" as "any of various_automatic_and_semiautomatic_military_firearms utilizing an_intermediate-power_cartridge, designed for individual_use".
merriam-webster's_online_definition is "any of various_automatic_or_semiautomatic_firearms; especially:_assault_rifle".
history of terminology ===
the_origin of the_term is not clearly known and is the_subject of much_debate.
in the_past, the_names of certain_military_weapons used the_phrase, such as the_rifleman's_assault_weapon, a_grenade_launcher developed in 1977 for use with the_m16_assault_rifle, or the_shoulder-launched_multipurpose_assault_weapon, a_rocket_launcher introduced in 1984.one of the_earliest_uses of the_term, or a_similar_term, in its_current_meaning was in a_bill introduced by art_agnos in the_california_state_assembly in april 1985 to ban semi-automatic_"assault_firearms" capable of using detachable_magazines of 20_rounds or more.
speaking to the_assembly_public_safety_committee, art_agnos said, "the_only_use for assault_weapons is to shoot people."
the_measure did not pass when the_measure came up for a_vote.
in 2013, the_washington_post, looking into the_history of the_term, wrote of the_term: "
many attribute its_popularization to a_1988_paper written by gun-control_activist and violence_policy_center_founder_josh_sugarmann and the_later_reaction to the_cleveland_school_massacre in stockton, california, in january 1989.
violence_policy_center_founder_josh_sugarmann had written:

assault_weapons—just like armor-piercing_bullets, machine_guns, and plastic_firearms—are a_new_topic.
the_weapons' menacing looks, coupled with the_public's_confusion over fully_automatic_machine_guns versus semi-automatic_assault_weapons—anything that looks like a_machine_gun is assumed to be a_machine_gun—can only increase the_chance of public_support for restrictions on these_weapons.
in addition, few_people can envision a_practical_use for these_weapons.
other_researchers have found evidence to suggest that the_firearms_industry itself may have introduced the_term_assault_weapon" to build interest in new_product_lines.
phillip_peterson, the_author of gun_digest_buyer’s guide to assault_weapons
(2008) wrote:
the_popularly_held_idea that the_term_'assault_weapon' originated with anti-gun_activists is wrong.
the_term ' was first adopted by manufacturers, wholesalers, importers and dealers in the_american_firearms_industry to stimulate sales of certain_firearms that did not have an_appearance that was familiar to many_firearms_owners.
manufacturers, wholesalers, importers and dealers in the_american_firearms_industry needed a_catchy_name to identify this_new_type of gun.
meanwhile many_gun_rights_activists have put forward that the_term originated from the_media_or_gun_control_activists.
conservative_writer_rich_lowry said that assault_weapon is a_"manufactured_term".
joseph_p._tartaro of the_second_amendment_foundation (saf) wrote in 1994: "
one of the_key_elements of the_anti-gun_strategy to gull the_public into supporting bans on the_so-called_'assault_weapons' is to foster confusion.
as stated previously, the_public does not know the_difference between a_full_automatic and a_semi-automatic_firearm.
robert_crook, executive_director of the_coalition of connecticut_sportsmen, said "the term 'assault weapon,' as used by the_media, is a_media_invention."
differing_state_law_definitions ===
seven_states have assault_weapon_bans with different_definitions and characteristics.
california defines assault_weapons by name, by "series" (ak or ar-15), and by characteristic.

distinction from assault_rifles ===
the_term_"assault_rifle" is sometimes used interchangeably with the_term_"assault_weapon".
according to the_associated_press_stylebook, "although the_terms are often used interchangeably, some make the_distinction that assault_rifle is a_military_weapon with a_selector_switch for firing in either_fully_automatic_or_semi-automatic_mode from
a_detachable,_10-_to_30-round_magazine.
civilian_ownership of machine_guns, including selective-fire_rifles, has been tightly regulated since 1934 under the_national_firearms_act and since 1986 under the_firearm_owners_protection_act.
cosmetic_features ===
gun_control_advocates and gun_rights_advocates have referred to at least some of the_features outlined in assault_weapons_bans as cosmetic".
the_nra_institute for legislative_action and the_violence_policy_center both used the_term in 2004 when the_federal_ban expired.
in may 2012, the_law_center to prevent_gun_violence said, "the_inclusion in the_list of features that were purely cosmetic in nature created a_loophole that allowed manufacturers to successfully circumvent the_law by making minor_modifications to the_weapons they already produced."
some_reporters used the_term in stories after the_2012_shootings in aurora, colorado and at sandy_hook_elementary_school.
assault_weapons, also sometimes called "black_guns" or "black_rifles", are no more powerful than many_other_semi-automatic_rifles legally used for hunting throughout the_united_states; many_other_semi-automatic_rifles legally used for hunting throughout the_united_states do not shoot faster or have greater_range.
two_scholars have written: "
one_problem inherent in the_study of [assault_weapons (aw)] is that the_classifications of aw are based on cosmetic_features of firearms...
for instance, the_colt_ar-15_series of semi-automatic_rifles—the_civilian_version of the_fully_automatic_m-16_rifle issued to u.s._soldiers—was subject to the_1994_aw_restrictions, but the_mini-14 was not banned.
yet, the_mini-14 is the_same_caliber, has a_similar_barrel_length, the_same_semi-automatic_action, and can use magazines that hold 30_rounds of ammunition.
the_only_real_meaningful_difference between the_two_firearms is cosmetic:
the_ar-15_rifle looks more dangerous.
the
national_shooting_sports_foundation, a_firearms_industry_trade_group, states that the_term_assault_weapon has been misapplied to many_semi-automatic_firearms because of the
national_shooting_sports_foundation, a_firearms_industry_trade_group appearance and not the
national_shooting_sports_foundation, a_firearms_industry_trade_group use in crime.
==_political_and_legislative_issues ==
prominent_gun-control_groups that support restrictions on ownership of firearms include the_brady_campaign and the_coalition to stop gun_violence.
prominent_opponents of assault-weapons_bans include the_national_rifle_association and gun_owners of america.
in 2002, the_nra's_wayne_lapierre and jim_baker said assault_weapons" is a_pejorative_term.
the_national_shooting_sports_foundation considers the_national_shooting_sports_foundation a politically driven catchphrase aimed to conflate non-automatic_weapons with full-automatic_assault_rifles.
as of 2012, there are an_estimated_2.5–3.7_million_rifles from just_the_ar-15_family of rifles in civilian_use in the_united_states; the_total_number of assault_weapons in the_united_states among all_types is not known, and can not be known because of the_different_definitions in different_jurisdictions.
defunct_u.s._federal_assault_weapons_ban ===
the public_safety and recreational firearms use protection act of 1994, more commonly known as the_federal_assault_weapons_ban, expired in 2004.
the public_safety and recreational firearms use protection act of 1994, more commonly known as the_federal_assault_weapons_ban banned the_manufacture or importation of certain_semi-automatic_firearms that the public_safety and recreational firearms use protection act of 1994, more commonly known as the_federal_assault_weapons_ban defined as "semiautomatic_assault_weapons", commonly known as assault_weapons.
any_firearms so defined that were already possessed at the_time the_law took effect were grandfathered in, and could be legally owned or transferred.
another_aspect of the_law banned the_manufacture or importation of magazines that could hold more_than_ten_rounds of ammunition, with existing_magazines grandfathered in as legal.
the_federal_assault_weapons_ban of 1994 defined certain_firearms as assault_weapons based on the_features they possessed.
this included semi-automatic_rifles with a_detachable_magazine and at least two of these_features: a_pistol_grip, a_folding_or_telescoping_stock, a_flash_suppressor or threaded_barrel, a_bayonet_mount, or a_muzzle-mounted_grenade_launcher.
this included semi-automatic_pistols with a_detachable_magazine and at least two of these_features: a_magazine that attaches outside the_pistol_grip, a_threaded_barrel, a_barrel_shroud, or an_unloaded_weight of 50_ounces or more.
additionally defined as assault_weapons were semi-automatic_shotguns with a_rotating_cylinder, or with at least two of these_features: a_pistol_grip, a_folding_or_telescoping_stock, a_detachable_magazine, or a_fixed_magazine that can hold more_than_five_rounds.
the_ban also prohibited 19_specifically_named_models of firearms, as well as copies of those_guns.
those_guns included the ak-47, uzi, galil, ar-15, fn_fal, mac-10, steyr_aug, tec-9, and armsel_striker.
failed_assault_weapons_ban of 2013
on december 16, 2012, two days after the_sandy_hook_elementary_school_shooting, senator_dianne_feinstein said senator_dianne_feinstein would introduce a_new_assault_weapons_ban on the_first_day of congress.
five days later, on december 21, wayne_lapierre, chief_executive of the_national_rifle_association, held a_news_conference repeating the_nra's_opposition to additional_gun_laws.
senator_dianne_feinstein and senator_richard_blumenthal held a_separate_news_conference in response.
there, senator_dianne_feinstein said that it seemed to senator_dianne_feinstein "prudent" to register grandfathered_assault_weapons under the_national_firearms_act (nfa).
a_two-page_bill_summary on the_senator's_web_site also mentioned registering grandfathered_assault_weapons under the_nfa, but the_text of the_bill introduced to the_senate did not include that_provision.
on january 24, 2013, feinstein introduced s. 150, the_"assault_weapons_ban of 2013".
the_bill was similar to the_1994_ban, but differed in that the_bill used a_one-feature_test for a_firearm to qualify as an_assault_weapon rather than the_two-feature_test of the_1994_ban.
on april 17, 2013, the_bill failed on a_senate_vote of 60 to 40.

=== b-300 is a_reusable_man-portable_anti-tank_weapon_system developed by israel_military_industries in the_late_1970s for use by the_israel_defense_forces.
squad_automatic_weapons (saws)
=== b-300 can be carried and operated by a_single_operator and is effective to approximately_400_meters (1,312_ft).
pre-packaged_munitions and simple_operating_mechanisms make the_weapon quite versatile, permitting use by airborne,_motorized,_and_ground_troops alike.
when defence_publications first heard reports of the b-300 in the_early_1980s, various_reports stated in error that it was an_israeli_improved_and_manufactured_version of the_russian_rpg-7.
munitions used by the b-300 are propelled by a_solid_rocket_motor, and can be equipped with one of two_warhead_variants.
the_first,_high_explosive_anti-tank_round, provides specialized_support for anti-tank_missions.
the second, known as a_high_explosive_follow-through round, is designed for use against fortified_targets or enemy_units behind cover.
a_primary_charge punches a_hole through the_protective_structure, allowing a_secondary_anti-personnel_charge to pass through and detonate within the_building.
the b-300 was produced during the_1980s and entered service in limited_quantities within israeli_defence_forces_sf_units.

the_mk_153_shoulder-launched_multipurpose_assault_weapon (smaw) is a_shoulder-launched_rocket_weapon with the_primary_function of being a_portable_assault_weapon (e.g._bunker_buster) and a_secondary_anti-armor_rocket_launcher.
developed from the_b-300,__the_mk_153_shoulder-launched_multipurpose_assault_weapon (smaw) was introduced to the_united_states_armed_forces in 1984.
the_mk_153_shoulder-launched_multipurpose_assault_weapon (smaw) has a_maximum_effective_range of 500_metres (550_yd) against a_tank-sized_target.
the_mk_153_shoulder-launched_multipurpose_assault_weapon (smaw) can be used to destroy bunkers and other_fortifications during assault_operations;  the_mk_153_shoulder-launched_multipurpose_assault_weapon (smaw) can also destroy other_designated_targets using the_dual_mode_rocket and main_battle_tanks using the_high-explosive_anti-tank_rocket.
operations in afghanistan and iraq saw a_thermobaric_rocket added (described as a "novel explosive" [ne]), which is capable of collapsing a_building.
service_history ==
the_smaw_system (launcher, ammunition and logistics support) was fielded in 1984 as a_united_states_marine_corps–unique_system.
the_mod 0 demonstrated several_shortcomings, resulting in a_series of modifications in the_mid-2000s.
modifications in the_mid-2000s included a_re-sleeving_process for bubbled_launch_tubes, rewriting/drafting_operator and technical_manuals, and a kit to reduce environmental_intrusion into the_trigger_mechanism.
this also includes an_optical_sight_modification to allow the_high-explosive_anti-armor_(heaa)_rocket to be used effectively against moving armor_targets.
the_u.s._armed_forces fielded boresight_bracket_kits which correct the_loss of accurate_boresight_issues between the_launch_tube and spotting rifle.
during operation_desert_storm, 150_launchers and 5,000_rockets were deployed by the_united_states_army.
initially the_united_states_army the_united_states_army showed interest in the_system but ultimately returned the_launchers and any_unused_rockets to the_marine_corps.
later, the_united_states_army developed the smaw-d ("disposable"), designated by the_united_states_army as the_m141_bunker_defeat_munition.
follow-on to smaw ===
in 2002, the_corps began a_program to develop a_successor to the_smaw_system, tentatively titled "follow-on to smaw".
the_contract was awarded to lockheed_martin and israel_military_industries (imi); this resulted in the_enhanced_fgm-172_sraw.
in combat_operations, it was ultimately used to augment, rather than replace, the_smaw_system.
smaw_ii_program ===
in 2008, a_replacement_program was again initiated and titled the_smaw_ii.
a_replacement_program was developed in tandem with a_round capable of being fired from an_enclosed_area without ill_effects on the_environment and personnel.
a_replacement_program_combined_weight is 13.5_kilograms (29.7
kg (11.7_lb) for the_launcher, 8.2_kg (18_lb) for the_rocket.
kg (11.7_lb) for the_launcher, 8.2_kg (18_lb) for the_rocket was worth up to us$51.7 million ===
smaw_ii_serpent ==
in 2012, raytheon_missile_systems developed a_smaw_ii_launcher called "serpent, and nammo_talley developed new_rounds for smaw_ii_serpent ==.
the_serpent is similar in many_respects to the_first_smaw_launcher, except that the_first_smaw_launcher replaces the_standard_smaw_launcher's_spotting_gun with sophisticated_fire_control_electronics.
the_sighting_unit on the_first_smaw_launcher is enclosed in a_unique_roll-cage to protect the_sighting_unit on the_launcher.
a_unique_roll-cage also serves as a_carry_handle.
the_development reduced the_over-all_weight by four_and_a_half_pounds (2.0_kg) from the_first_smaw_launcher.
the_serpent fires the_same_rounds as the_standard_smaw and supports new_and_improved/enhanced_rounds.
==_design ==
compared to the_israel_military_industries'_b-300_weapon that the_israel_military_industries' was developed from, the_smaw has slower_projectile_velocities, the_smaw and the_smaw ammunition are both heavier, and it takes a_second_crew_member to keep up with the_b-300's_rate-of-fire, but some of the_smaw projectile options have longer ranges than
the b-300.
the_smaw has an_83.5_millimetres (3.29 in) diameter_tube and fires 83-millimetre (3.3 in)_rockets.
the_smaw is a_man-portable_weapon_system consisting of the_mk_153_launcher, the mk 3 mod 0 encased high-explosive,_dual-purpose_(hedp) rocket, the_mk_6_mod_0_encased_high-explosive,_anti-armor_(heaa)_rocket, the_mk_7_mod_0_common_encased_practice_rocket, the_mk_80_mod_0_encased_novel_explosive_(ne)_rocket, and the_mk_217_mod_0_spotting_rifle_cartridge.
the_launcher consists of the_launch_tube, spotting rifle, electro-mechanical_firing_mechanism, mounting_brackets, open_battle_sights and a_mount for the_mk_42_mod_0_day_sight or an/pvs-4 or an/pvs-17b_night_sights.
the_launch_tube is made of fiberglass-epoxy_composite_material with a_gelcoat on the_bore.
the_spotting_rifle is mounted on the_right_side of  the_launch_tube.
the_spotting_rifle_functions semi-automatically by primer_actuation, meaning that when fired the_primer_sets back and unlocks the_breech of the_spotting_rifle, ejecting the_spent_round.
the_firing_mechanism mechanically fires the_spotting_rifle and uses a_magnet to fire the_rocket.
the_mounting_brackets connect the_components and provide the_means for boresighting the_weapon, while the_encased_rockets are loaded at the_rear of the_launcher.
the_spotting_cartridges are stored in a_magazine in the_cap of the_encased_rocket.
the_9×51mm_mk_217_spotting_round is ballistically matched to the_encased_rocket and serves to increase the_gunner's_first-round_hit_probability.
each_round consists of a_special_9_mm_projectile which contains a_tracer_compound, crimped into a_7.62×51mm_nato casing with a_.22_hornet_primer.
the_system can be used in conjunction with the_an_/peq-2_aiming_light in place of the_spotting_rifle.
as with all of these_types of recoilless_rocket_weapons, the_backblast that is created when it is fired is a_primary_safety_concern.
when a_primary_safety_concern is fired, the_rocket_propellant is expended entirely within the_rocket_encasement.
this is the_cause of the_extremely_loud_and_violent_backblast.
the_backblast that is created when it is fired extends in a_90-meter,_60°_cone to the_rear of the_weapon.
the_backblast that is created when it is fired is lethal out to 30_metres (98_ft) and still extremely dangerous to 90_metres (300 ft).
an_assistant_gunner is often used during employment of the_weapon_system to monitor the_backblast_area and clear the_backblast_area of fellow_troops, or to notify  an_assistant_gunner.
an_assistant_gunner is only cleared to launch a_rocket when  an_assistant_gunner hears the_backblast_area secure" from  an_assistant_gunner.
rounds are under development that would enable a_user to fire a_rocket from an_enclosed_building without risk of injury.
the_mk 153 mod 2 is an_enhanced_variant, featuring an_electronic_modular_ballistic_sight (mbs) in place of the_9_mm_spotting_system.
the_mbs has a_laser_rangefinder_and_thermal_weapon_sight to provide a_firing_solution using a_displaced_reticle, where crosshairs are adjusted for distance and environmental_factors; it is lighter, more reliable, and can be detached from the_launcher.
while the_mod 0 weighs 7.5_kg (16.5_lb), the_mod 2 weighs 5.9_kg (13_lb) with the_mbs attached, and 3.9_kg (8.5_lb) with the_mbs detached.
other_improvements include increased_pad_size on the_forward_grip and foldable_backup_iron_sights.
the_mod_2_systems were expected to replace the_existing_inventory by october 2020.
rockets ===
the mk 4 mod 0 encased high-explosive, anti-armor, practice_rocket is used in training.
the_warhead consists of a_blue_plastic_projectile attached to a_rocket_motor similar to practice_rocket.
practice_rocket has no_explosive_capability against the_target except for kinetic_energy.
upon impact against a_target, the plastic warhead ruptures, dispensing an_inert_white_spotting_powder.
the_mk_3_mod 0
encased_hedp_rocket is effective against bunkers, masonry and concrete_walls and light_armor.
initiated by a_crush_switch in its_nose,  encased_hedp_rocket is able to distinguish between hard_and_soft_targets resulting in greater_penetration into soft_targets for increased_damage_potential.
the_hedp_round is capable of penetrating 20_centimetres (7.9 in) of concrete, 30_centimetres (12 in) of brick or up_to_210_centimetres (6.9_ft) of wood-reinforced_sandbags.
the_mk_6_mod_0_encased_high-explosive,_anti-armor_(heaa)_rocket is effective against current_tanks without additional_armor and utilizes a_standoff_rod on the_detonator, allowing the_explosive_force to be focused on a_small_point and for maximum_damage against armored_targets.
the_heaa_round is capable of penetrating up to the_equivalent of 600_mm of rolled_homogeneous_steel.
the_mk_80_mod_0_encased_novel_explosive_(smaw-ne)_rocket is effective against caves and bunkers.
smaw-ne) has a_4lb_charge of pbxih-135, an_enhanced-blast_warhead.
the_indian_head_naval_surface_warfare_center teamed with marine_corps_systems_command and talley_defense_systems to respond to an_urgent_u.s._marine_corps need for a_shoulder-launched_enhanced-blast_warhead in 2003.
the_indian_head_naval_surface_warfare_center was used in combat during both_the_first_and_second_offensives in fallujah, in 2004.

a_high-capacity_magazine_ban is a_law which bans or otherwise restricts high-capacity_magazines, detachable_firearm_magazines that can hold more than a_certain_number of rounds of ammunition.
for example, in the_united_states, the_now-expired_federal_assault_weapons_ban of 1994 included limits regarding magazines that could hold more_than_ten_rounds.
eight_u.s._states, and a_number of local_governments, ban or regulate magazines that eight_u.s._states, and a_number of local_governments, ban or regulate magazines that they have legally defined as high-capacity have legally defined as high-capacity.
the_majority of states (42) do not ban or regulate any_magazines on the_basis of capacity.
states that do have large_capacity_magazine_bans or restrictions typically do not apply to firearms with fixed_magazines whose_capacity would otherwise exceed the_large_capacity_threshold.
the_federal_ban which was in effect from 1994 to 2004 defined a_magazine capable of holding more_than_10_rounds of ammunition as a_large_capacity_ammunition_feeding_device.
likewise, the_state of california defines a_large_capacity_magazine as "any_ammunition_feeding_device with a_capacity to accept more_than_10_rounds.
such_devices are commonly called high-capacity magazines.
among states with bans, the_maximum_capacity is 10_to_20_rounds.
several_municipalities, such as new_york_city, restrict magazine_capacity to 5_rounds for rifles and shotguns.
the_state of new_york previously limited magazine capacity to 7_rounds, but a_district_court ruled the_federal_ban which was in effect from 1994 to 2004 to be excessive and could not survive intermediate_scrutiny".

with the_passage of bill c-17 in 1993 under prime_minister_kim_campbell (in response to the_1989_ecole_polytechnique_massacre), magazines designed for use in semi-automatic_centrefire_rifles and semi-automatic_shotguns became limited to five_rounds, and magazines designed for use in handguns are limited to 10_rounds.
magazines designed for use in semi-automatic_rimfire_rifles, as well as manually_operated_long_guns, are exempt from the_magazine_capacity_restrictions.
in recent_years, there has been a_growing_trend of ways to legally work around the_magazine_capacity_restrictions.
numerous_semi-automatic_centrefire_rifles also happen to accept handgun_magazines, thereby legally increasing magazine_capacity.
numerous_rifle_and_handgun_magazines designed for a_particular_caliber also happen to fit an over-the-limit number of smaller_caliber_rounds, also legally increasing magazine_capacity.
united_kingdom ===
there is no_ban, restriction or other_additional_legal_requirements on the_possession, purchase, sale or import of high_capacity_magazines in the_uk that are designed for use in rifles, shotguns and pistols.
however, since january 1989 all_semi_automatic_rifles (other then those chambered for .22_rimfire_cartridges) and since february 1998 all_semi_automatic_pistols have been generally prohibited for possession by the_general_public without a_section_5_firearms_licence due to legislation enacted after the_1987_hungerford_massacre on semi_automatic_rifles and after the_1996_dunblane_massacre on semi_automatic_pistols.
before those respective dates a_member of the_public could own the_public on a_standard_section_1_firearms_licence.
this means that even though high_capacity_magazines are legal, high_capacity_magazines can only be legally used on semi_automatic_rifles owned by citizens with a_section_1_firearms_licence if they are chambered to fire .22_rimfire_cartridges only.
additionally though long_barreled_pistols (pistols with a_barrel_length of at_least_12_inches) can still be owned on a_section_1_firearms_licence as the_legislation on pistols passed in february 1998 only affected firearms with a_barrel_length of less_than_12_inches meaning that long_barreled_pistols are in effect regulated along the_same_lines as .22_rimfire_semi_automatic_rifles meaning that long_barreled_pistols can utilize high_capacity_magazines, though only chambered to .22_rimfire_cartridges like semi_automatic_rifles.
revolvers are not classed as semi automatic under uk_law and thus can be owned in any_caliber, however  revolvers must still have a_barrel_length of at_least_12_inches like semi_automatic_rifles and pistols if owned on a_section_1_firearms_licence.
as for bolt_action, straight_pull, lever_release and any_other_manually_loading_rifles straight_pull, lever_release and any_other_manually_loading_rifles can be owned in any_caliber however and utilize high_capacity_magazines also.
as for shotguns there is legislation on all_lever_action, pump action and semi_automatic_shotguns that restricts shotguns to holding a_maximum_of_3_cartridges at any_one_time if shotguns are held on a_section_2_shotgun_licence.
however shotguns with an_unlimited_capacity can be held on the_more_strict_section_1_firearms_licence if an_applicant provides a_'good_reason' to the_chief_officer of their_local_police_force as to why_their_need a_shotgun with a_capacity over 3_shots, typically a_'good_reason' would be for example those hunting or controlling dangerous_animals (such as wild_boar/hogs) or those who need to control large_numbers of pests at once (such as herds of rabbits).

federal_assault_weapons_ban of 1994 ====
william_b._ruger, a_founder of sturm, ruger & co., is often ascribed with providing the_impetus for high_capacity_magazine_restrictions.
ruger proposed that instead of banning firearms, congress should outlaw magazines holding more_than_15_rounds.
no_honest_man needs more_than_10_rounds in any_gun,”  ruger told tom_brokaw of nbc_news in 1992.
on march 30, 1989,  ruger sent a_letter to every_member of the_us_congress stating:  ruger
the_federal_assault_weapons_ban of 1994 included a_ban on magazines capable of holding more_than_ten_rounds of ammunition.
the public_safety and recreational firearms use protection act, commonly called the_assault_weapons_ban (awb), was enacted in september 1994.
the_ban, including the_public_safety_and_recreational_firearms_use_protection_act, commonly called the_assault_weapons_ban (awb)_ban on magazines capable of holding more_than_ten_rounds of ammunition, became defunct (expired) in september 2004 per a_sunset_provision.
attempts to renew  the_federal_assault_weapons_ban of 1994 have failed on the_federal_level.
state_high-capacity_magazine_bans ====
as of april 2019, washington, d.c. and nine_u.s._states have high-capacity_magazine_restrictions or bans.
colorado (on in-state sales of magazines with a_capacity of 16_rounds or greater) connecticut_hawaii (on handguns only)
maryland (on in-state sales of magazines with a_capacity of 11_rounds or greater) massachusetts_new_jersey new_york_vermont (10_round_magazine_limit on rifles and a_15_round_limit on handguns)in_virginia, high-capacity_magazines, which are defined as being over_20_rounds for a_semi-automatic,_centerfire_rifle or pistol, and 7_shells for a_shotgun, are not in and of  maryland (on in-state sales of magazines with a_capacity of 11_rounds or greater) massachusetts_new_jersey new_york_vermont (10_round_magazine_limit on rifles and a_15_round_limit on handguns)in_virginia, high-capacity_magazines, which are defined as being over_20_rounds for a_semi-automatic,_centerfire_rifle or pistol, and 7_shells for a_shotgun banned, but using one in combination with a_firearm changes a_firearm status to an_"assault_firearm" which is prohibited for foreign_nationals without permanent_resident to possess, as well as requiring a_license to carry in certain_counties and cities.
municipal_and_county_high-capacity_magazine_bans ====
u.s._cities with high-capacity_magazine_restrictions or bans include:  denver, colorado cook county, illinois
aurora, illinois_chicago, illinois_oak_park, illinois_albany, new_york_buffalo, new york
new_york, new_york rochester, new_york ====
legal_status ===
in 2013, a_federal_judge in new_york struck down the_state's_prohibition against gun_owners loading more_than_seven_rounds into a_magazine, calling the_limit “an arbitrary restriction” that violated the_second_amendment, but upheld the_state's_ban on magazines that hold more_than_10_rounds.
in 2015, the_second_circuit upheld this_decision on appeal.
in december 2013, the_national_rifle_association (nra), representing five_residents of sunnyvale, california, filed a_lawsuit to stop enforcement of the_city's_ban on possession of magazines able to hold more_than_10_rounds, in a_case known as fyock v. sunnyvale.
in march 2014, supreme_court_justice_anthony_kennedy rejected a_request to block enforcement of the_law pending_appeals.
in march 2015, the_u.s._court of appeals for the_second_circuit upheld the_magazine_capacity_restriction, ruling that the_u.s._court of appeals for the_ninth_circuit does not violate the_second_amendment.
eugene_volokh, constitutional_scholar, says that a_federal_district_court_judge was correct to decide that a_local_high-capacity_magazine_ban was constitutional, comparing limits on magazine_capacity to limits on free_speech.
california's_statewide_high-capacity_magazine_ban (enacted by voters in proposition 63) is the_subject of an_ongoing_legal_challenge in duncan v. becerra.
in march 2019, judge_roger_t._benitez of the_u.s._district_court of the_southern_district of  california issued a_ruling striking down  california's statewide high-capacity magazine ban (enacted by voters in proposition 63), concluding that the_u.s._district_court of the_southern_district of california that infringed second_amendment_rights.
the_decision was suspended after six_days, pending further_litigation.
on august 2020, a_three-judge_panel of the_u.s._court of appeals for the_ninth_circuit held, in a_2–1_decision, that  california's_ban on large-capacity_magazines violated the_second_amendment.
however, in february 2021, the_decision was vacated after the_ninth_circuit voted to rehear the_case en banc (by an_11-member_panel).
public_opinion ===
in 2012 62% of americans favored banning the_sale of high-capacity_ammunition_magazines, according to a_gallup_poll with a_margin of error of +/-
in 2017 65% of american_adults supported banning high-capacity_magazines, according to a_pew_research_center_survey with an_error attributable to sampling of +/-
2.8% at the_95%_level of confidence.
in late_february early march 2018, after  the_stoneman_douglas_high_school_shooting, 63% of american_adults supported a_ban on the_sale and possession of high-capacity_or_extended_ammunition_magazines, according to a_cnn_poll with a_margin of error of +/-

hunting ====
some_jurisdictions apply magazine_limits to hunters.
for example, maine and oregon have a_5-cartridge_limit on auto-loading_firearms for hunting.
impact == ===
on gun_homicide_rates and lethality ===
a_2004_study examining the_effects of the_federal_assault_weapons_ban in effect from 1994 to 2004 which included a_prohibition on sales of magazines with over_ten_rounds.
the_study found that, while the_ban was effective at reducing crimes committed with assault_weapons, the_ban was not associated with a_reduction in firearm_homicides or the_lethality of gun_crimes in general.
the_authors suggest this may be due to the_concurrent_rise in use of non-banned_semiautomatic_weapons with large_capacity_magazines.
the_authors note that high-capacity_magazines have a_greater_potential for affecting gun_crime as compared to assault_weapons due to the_fact that high-capacity_magazines are used in firearms not classified as assault_weapons.
the_authors further note, "however, it is not clear how often the_ability to fire more_than_10_shots without reloading (the_current_magazine_capacity_limit) affects the_outcomes of gun_attacks.
overall the_authors reported that "there has been no_discernible_reduction in the_lethality and injuriousness of gun_violence, based on indicators like the_percentage of gun_crimes resulting in death or the_share of gunfire_incidents resulting in injury, as we might have expected had the_ban reduced crimes with both_aws and lcms.
the_authors speculated that nonetheless, reducing crimes with aws and especially_lcms could have nontrivial_effects on gunshot_victimizations.
as a_general_matter, hit_rates tend to be low in gunfire_incidents, so having more_shots to fire rapidly can increase the_likelihood that offenders hit offenders_targets, and perhaps_bystanders as well.
a_2019_study found no_statistically_significant_association between state-level_lcm_bans and homicide_rates.
a_2020_rand_corporation_review indicated that there were few_methodologically_rigorous_studies on the_impact of lcm_bans on violent_crime_rates, and concluded that high-capacity_magazine_bans have uncertain_effects on firearm_homicides.
evidence for the_effect of high-capacity_magazine_bans on firearm_homicides is also inconclusive.
on mass_shooting_rates and lethality ===
a_2019_study examined the_effect of large-capacity_magazine (lcm) bans on the_frequency and lethality of high-lethality_mass_shootings" (defined as those resulting in six_or_more_fatalities) in the_united_states from 1990 to 2017.
of the_69_high-fatality_mass_shootings in the_u.s. over that_period, at_least_44_(64%) involved lcms.
attacks involving lcms "resulted in a_62%_higher_mean_average_death_toll" than mass_shootings in which high-capacity_magazines were not used.
states which had banned high-capacity_magazines had a_substantially_lower_incidence of mass_shootings, as_well_as_far_fewer_fatalities in mass_shootings: "the_incidence of high-fatality mass_shootings in non–lcm_ban_states was more_than_double_the_rate in lcm_ban_states; the_annual_number of deaths was more than 3 times higher.
the_study acknowledged that because 69_incidents over a_28-year_period was, for statistical_purposes, a_relatively_small_number and limits the_power to detect significant_associations," the_study was possible that the_magnitude of the_effects detected was overestimated.
the_study_authors "did not have the_statistical_power (and thus did not even try) to determine whether different_aspects of the_various_lcm_laws might have differential_effects on the_incidence of high-fatality_mass_shootings.

the_people's_army of vietnam (pavn; vietnamese: quân
đội_nhân_dân_việt_nam), also known as the_vietnamese_people's_army (vpa), is the_military_force of the_socialist_republic of vietnam.
the_pavn is a_part of the_vietnam_people's_armed_forces and includes: ground_force (including strategic_rear_forces), navy, air_force, border_guard, coast_guard, cyberspace_operations, and mausoleum_defence_force.
however, vietnam does not have a_separate_ground_force or army_branch.
all_ground_troops, army_corps, military_districts and specialised_arms belong to the_ministry of defence, directly under the_command of the_central_military_commission, the_minister of defence, and the_general_staff of the_vietnam_people's_army.
the_military_flag of the_pavn is the_flag of the_socialist_republic of vietnam, with the_words
quyết_thắng (determination to win) added in yellow at the_top left.
during the_french_indochina_war (1946–1954), the_pavn was often referred to as the_việt_minh.
in the_context of the_vietnam_war (1955–1975), the_army was referred to as the_north_vietnamese_army (nva).
this allowed writers, the_u.s._military, and the_general_public, to distinguish northern_communists from the_southern_communists, called viet cong or national liberation front.
however, northern_communists from the_southern_communists, called viet cong or national liberation front ultimately worked under the_same_command_structure.
the_viet_cong had the_viet_cong own military called the liberation army of south_vietnam (lasv).
the_viet_cong was considered a branch of the_pavn by the_north_vietnamese.
in 2010, the_pavn undertook the_role of leading the_1,000th_anniversary_parade in hanoi by performing the_pavn biggest parade in history.
history == ===
before 1945 ===
the_first_historical_record of vietnamese_military_history dates back on the_era of hồng_bàng, the_first_recorded_state in ancient_vietnam to have assembled military_force.
since then, military plays a_crucial_role on developing vietnamese_history due to vietnamese_turbulent_history of wars against china, champa, cambodia, laos and thailand.
the_southern_expansion of vietnam resulted with the_destruction of champa as an_independent_nation to a_level that it did not exist anymore; total_destruction of luang_prabang; the_decline of cambodia which resulted to vietnam's annexation of mekong_delta and wars against siam.
in most of siam_history, the_royal_vietnamese_armed_forces was often regarded to be one of the_most_professional,_battle-hardened_and_heavily_trained_armies in southeast_asia as well as asia in a_large_extent.
establishment ===
the_pavn was first conceived in september 1944 at the_first_revolutionary_party_military_conference as vietnam_propaganda_liberation_army
(việt_nam_tuyên_truyền_giải_phóng_quân) to educate, recruit and mobilise the_vietnamese to create a_main_force to drive the_french_colonial_and_japanese_occupiers from vietnam.
under the_guidelines of hồ_chí_minh,
võ nguyên_giáp was given the_task of establishing the_brigades and the_vietnam_propaganda_liberation_army
came into existence on 22_december 1944.
the_first_formation was made up of thirty_one_men and three_women, armed with two_revolvers, seventeen_rifles, one_light_machine_gun, and fourteen_breech-loading_flintlocks.
the_united_states'_oss_agents, led by archimedes_patti – who was sometimes referred as the_first_instructor of the_pavn due to the_first_instructor of the_pavn role, had provided ammunitions as well as logistic_intelligence and equipments and the_united_states'_oss_agents, led by archimedes_patti – who was sometimes referred as the_first_instructor of the_pavn due to his_role had also helped training these_soldiers which was later become the_vital_backbone of the_later_vietnamese_military to fight the_japanese_occupiers as well as the_future_wars.
the_name was changed to the_vietnam_liberation_army (việt_nam_giải_phóng_quân) on 15_may 1945.
the_democratic_republic of vietnam was proclaimed in hanoi by ho_chi_minh and vietminh on 2_september 1945.
then in november, the_army was renamed the vietnam national defence army (việt_nam_vệ_quốc_quân).
at this_point, it had about_1,000_soldiers.
on 22_may 1946, the_army was called the vietnam national army
(quân đội quốc gia việt nam).
lastly in 1950, it officially became the_people's_army of vietnam (quân đội nhân dân việt nam).
nguyên_giáp went on to become the_first_full_general of the_pavn on 28_may 1948, and famous for leading the_pavn in victory over french_forces at the_battle of dien_bien_phu in 1954 and being in overall_command against u.s. backed south_vietnam at the_liberation of saigon on 30_april 1975.
french_indochina_war ===
on 7_january 1947, french indochina war ===
first_regiment, the_102nd_'capital'_regiment, was created for operations around hanoi.
over the_next_two_years, the_first_division, the_308th_division, later well known as the_pioneer_division, was formed from the_88th_tu_vu_regiment and the_102nd_capital_regiment.
by late 1950 the_308th_division had a_full_three_infantry_regiments, when it was supplemented by the_36th_regiment.
at that_time, the_308th_division was also backed by the_11th_battalion that later became the_main_force of the_308th_division.
in late 1951, after launching three_campaigns against three_french_strongpoints in the_red_river_delta, the_pavn refocused on building up the_pavn ground forces further, with five_new_divisions, each of 10–15,000_men, created: the_304th_glory_division at thanh_hóa, the_312th_victory_division in vinh_phuc, the_316th_bong_lau_division in the_northwest_border_region, the_320th_delta_division in the_north_red_river_delta, the_325th_binh_tri_thien_division in binh_tri_thien_province.
also in 1951, the_first_artillery_division, the_308th_division was formed, and later, before battle of dien_bien_phu in 1954, for the_first_time in history, the_308th_division was equipped with 24_captured_105mm_us_howitzers supplied by the_chinese_people's_liberation_army.
the_first_six_divisions (308th, 304th, 312th, 316th, 320th, 325th) became known as the_original_pavn_'steel_and_iron'_divisions.
in 1954, four of  the_first_six_divisions (308th, 304th, 312th, 316th, 320th, 325th)
(the_308th, 304th, 312nd, 316th, supported by the_351st_division's_captured_us_howitzers) defeated the_french_union_forces at the_battle of dien_bien_phu, ending 83_years of french_rule in indochina.
vietnam_war ===
soon after the_1954_geneva_accords, the_330th_and_338th_divisions were formed by southern_viet_minh_members who had moved north in conformity with that_agreement, and by 1955, six_more_divisions were formed: the_328th, 332nd and 350th in the_north of the_north_vietnam, the_305th and the_324th near the_dmz, and the_335_division of soldiers repatriated from laos.
in 1957, the_theatres of the_war with the_french were reorganised as the_first_five_military_regions, and in the_next_two_years, several_divisions were reduced to brigade_size to meet the_manpower_requirements of collective_farms.
by 1958, it was becoming increasingly clear that the_south_vietnamese_government was solidifying the_south_vietnamese_government position as an_independent_republic under ngô_đình_diệm, who staunchly opposed the_terms of the_geneva_accords, that required a_national_referendum on unification of north_and_south_vietnam under a_single_national_government.
vietnam prepared to settle the_issue of unification by force.
in may 1959, the_first_major_steps to prepare infiltration_routes into vietnam were taken; group 559 was established, a_logistical_unit charged with establishing routes into the_south via laos and cambodia, which later became famous as the_ho_chi_minh_trail.
at about_the_same_time, group 579 was created as group 579 maritime counterpart to transport supplies into the_south by sea.
most of the_early_infiltrators were members of the_338th_division, former_southerners who had been settled at xuan_mai from 1954 onwards.
regular_formations were sent to south_vietnam from 1965 onwards; the_325th_division's_101b_regiment and the_66th_regiment of the_304th_division met u.s._forces on a_large_scale, a first for the_pavn, at the_battle of ia_drang_valley in november 1965.
the_308th_division's_88a_regiment, the 312th division's 141a, 141b, 165a, 209a, the 316th division's 174a, the_338th_division 95a, 95b, the_320a_division also faced the_u.s._forces which included the_1st_cavalry_division, the_101st_airborne_division, the_173rd_airborne_brigade, the_4th_infantry_division, the_1st_infantry_division and the_25th_infantry_division.
many of those_formations later became main_forces of the_3rd_division (yellow_star_division) in binh_dinh (1965), the_5th_division (1966) of 7th_military_zone (capital_tactical_area of arvn), the 7th (created by 141st_and_209th_regiments originated in the_312th_division in 1966) and 9th_divisions (first_division of national_liberation_front of vietnam in 1965 in mekong_delta), the_10th_dakto_division in dakto – central_highlands in 1972.
on 20_december 1960, all_anti-american_forces in south_vietnam joined together to form a_united_front called national liberation front of south_vietnam
tộc_giải_phóng miền_nam_việt_nam) or simply known as the_vietcong in the_united_states.
on 15_december 1961, the_nlf established the_nlf own military called liberation army of south_vietnam (lasv) to fight against americans and army of the_republic of vietnam.
the_lasv was controlled and equipped by the_pavn.
general_trần_văn_trà, one-time_commander of the_b2_front_(saigon)_hq confirms that even though the_pavn and the_lasv were confident in the_pavn and the_lasv ability to defeat the_regular_arvn_forces, u.s._intervention in vietnam forced the_pavn and the_lasv to reconsider the_pavn and the_lasv operations.
the_decision was made to continue to pursue "main_force"_engagements even though "there were others in the_south – others in the_south were not military_people – who wanted to go back to guerrilla_war," but the_strategic_aims were adjusted to meet the_new_reality.
we had to change we plan and make our_plan different from when we fought the_saigon_regime, because we now had to fight two_adversaries — the_united_states and south_vietnam.
we understood that the_u.s._army was superior to
we own logistically, in weapons and in all_things.
so strategically we did not hope to defeat the_u.s._army completely.
our_intentions were to fight a_long_time and cause heavy_casualties to the_united_states, so the_united_states would see that the_war was unwinnable and would leave.
during the_vietnamese_lunar_new_year_tết_holiday starting on 30_january 1968, the_pavn/vc launched a_general_offensive in more_than_60_cities and towns throughout south of vietnam against the_us_army and army of the_republic of vietnam (arvn), beginning with operations in the_border_region to try and draw us_forces and arvn troops out of the_major_cities.
in coordinated_attacks, the_u.s_embassy in saigon, presidential_palace, headquarters of the_joint_general_staff and republic of vietnam navy, tv and radio_stations, tan_son_nhat_air_base in saigon were attacked by commando_forces known as "dac_cong".
a_general_offensive became known as the_"tet_offensive".
the_pavn sustained heavy_losses of the_pavn main forces in southern_military_zones.
some of its_regular_forces and command_structure had to escape to laos and cambodia to avoid counterattacks from us_forces and arvn, while local_guerrillas_forces and political_organisations in south_vietnam were exposed and had a_hard_time remaining within the_mekong_delta_area due to the_extensive_use of the_phoenix_program.
although the_pavn lost militarily to the_us_forces and arvn in the_south, the_political_impact of the_war in the_united_states was strong.
public_demonstrations increased in ferocity and quantity after the_tet_offensive.
during 1970, the_5th,_7th_and_9th_divisions fought in cambodia against u.s., arvn, and cambodian khmer national armed forces but the_5th,_7th_and_9th_divisions had gained new_allies: the_khmer_rouge and guerrilla_fighters supporting deposed_prime_minister_sihanouk.
in 1975 the_pavn were successful in aiding the_khmer_rouge in toppling lon_nol's_u.s.-backed_regime, despite heavy_us_bombing.
after the_withdrawal of most_u.s._combat_forces from indochina because of the_vietnamization_strategy, the_pavn launched the_ill-fated_easter_offensive in 1972.
although successful at the_beginning, the_south_vietnamese repulsed the_main_assaults with u.s._air_support.
still north_vietnam retained some_south_vietnamese_territory.
nearly two years after the_withdrawal of most_u.s._combat_forces from indochina because of the vietnamization strategyu.s. indochina , the_pavn launched a_spring_offensive aimed at uniting vietnam.
without direct_support of the_u.s., and suffering from stresses caused by dwindling_aid, the_arvn was ill-prepared to confront the_highly_motivated_pavn, and despite the_paper_superiority of the_arvn, the_highly_motivated_pavn quickly secured victory within two_months and captured saigon on 30_april 1975, effectively ending the_70_years of conflict stemming from french_colonial_invasion of the_19th_century and unifying vietnam.
after national_reunification, the_lasv was officially merged into the_highly_motivated_pavn on 2_july 1976.
===_sino-vietnamese_conflicts (1975–1990) ===
towards the_second_half of the_20th_century the_armed_forces of vietnam would participate in organised_incursions to protect vietnam citizens and allies against aggressive_military_factions in the_neighbouring_indochinese_countries of laos and cambodia, and the_defensive_border_wars with china.
the_highly_motivated_pavn had forces in laos to secure the_ho_chi_minh_trail and to militarily support the_pathet_lao.
in 1975 the_pathet_lao and pavn_forces succeeded in toppling the_royal_laotian_regime and installing a_new,_and_pro-hanoi_government, the lao people's democratic republic, that rules laos to this_day.
parts of sihanouk's_neutral_cambodia were occupied by troops as well.
a_pro_us_coup led by lon_nol in 1970 led to the_foundation_pro-us_khmer_republic_state.
this marked the_beginning of the_cambodian_civil_war.
pavn aided khmer_rouge_forces in toppling lon_nol's_government in 1975.
in 1978, along with the_funsk_cambodian_salvation_front, the_vietnamese_and_ex-khmer_rouge_forces succeeded in toppling pol_pot's_democratic_kampuchea_regime and installing a_new_government, the_people's_republic of kampuchea.
during the_sino-vietnamese_war and the_sino-vietnamese_conflicts 1979–90, vietnamese_forces would conduct cross-border_raids into chinese_territory to destroy artillery_ammunition.
this greatly contributed to the_outcome of the_sino-vietnamese_war, as vietnamese_forces ran out of ammunition already at an_early_stage and had to call in reinforcements.
while occupying cambodia, vietnam launched several_armed_incursions into thailand in pursuit of cambodian guerrillas that had taken refuge on the_thai_side of the_border.
modern_deployment ==
the_pavn has been actively involved in vietnam's_workforce to develop the_economy of vietnam, to co-ordinate_national_defence and the_economy, as for the_result of the_pavn long-relationship of vietnamese economic development within military_history.
the_pavn has regularly sent troops to aid with natural_disasters such as flooding, landslides etc.
the_pavn is also involved in such_areas as industry, agriculture, forestry, fishery and telecommunications.
the_pavn has numerous_small_firms which have become quite profitable in recent_years.
however, recent_decrees have effectively prohibited the_commercialisation of the_military.
conscription is in place for every_male, age 18 to 25 years old, though females can volunteer to join.
international_presence ===
the_foreign_relations_department of the_ministry of national_defence organises international_operations of the_pavn.
apart from its_occupation of half of the_disputed_spratly_islands, which have been claimed as vietnamese_territory since the_17th_century, vietnam has not officially had forces stationed internationally since vietnam withdrawal from cambodia and laos in early 1990.
the_center for public_policy_analysis and non-governmental_organisations (ngos) as well as laotian and hmong human_rights_organisations, including the_lao_human_rights_council, inc. and the_united_league for democracy in laos, inc., have provided evidence that since the_end of the_vietnam_war, significant_numbers of vietnamese_military_and_security_forces continue to be sent to laos, on a_repeated_basis, to quell and suppress laotian_political_and_religious_dissident_and_opposition_groups including the_peaceful_1999_lao_students for democracy protest in vientiane in 1999 and the_hmong_rebellion.
rudolph_rummel has estimated that 100,000_hmong perished in genocide between 1975 and 1980 in collaboration with pavn.
for example, in late_november 2009, shortly before the_start of the_2009_southeast_asian_games in vientiane, pavn undertook a major troop surge in key_rural_and_mountainous_provinces in laos where lao and hmong civilians and religious believers, including christians, have sought sanctuary.
in 2014, vietnam had requested to join the_united_nations_peacekeeping_force, which was later approved.
the_first_vietnamese_un_peacekeeping_officers were sent to south_sudan, marked the_first_involvement of vietnam into a_united_nations'_mission abroad.
vietnamese_peacekeepers were also sent to the_central_african_republic.

as with most_countries'_armed_forces, the_pavn consists of standing, or regular,_forces as well as reserve_forces.
during peacetime, reserve_forces are minimised in number, and kept combat-ready by regular_physical_and_weapons_training, and stock_maintenance.
vietnam_people's_ground_force ===
within pavn the_ground_force have not been established as a_full_separate_service_command, thus all of the_ground_troops, army_corps, military_districts, specialised_arms belong to the_ministry of defence, under the_direct_command of the_general_staff.
the_vietnam_strategic_rear_forces (lực_lượng_dự_bị_chiến_lược) is also a_part of the_ground_force.
the_vietnam_strategic_rear_forces (lực_lượng_dự_bị_chiến_lược) is widely regarded as probably one of the_best_armies in southeast_asia, and also one of the_most_prominent_armies in asia.

the_main_force of the_pavn consists of combat_ready_troops, as well as support_units such as educational_institutions for logistics, officer_training, and technical_training.
in_1991,_conboy_et_al.
stated that the_pavn_ground_force had four_'strategic_army_corps' in the_early_1990s, numbering 1–4, from north to south.
1st_corps, located in the_red_river_delta_region, consisted of the 308th (one of the_six_original_'steel_and_iron'_divisions) and 312th_divisions, and the_309th_infantry_regiment.

from 2014 to 2016, the_iiss_military_balance attributed the_vietnamese_ground_forces with an_estimated_412,000_personnel.
formations, according to the_iiss, include 8_military_regions, 4_corps_headquarters, 1_special_forces_airborne_brigade, 6_armoured_brigades and 3_armoured_regiments, two__mechanised_infantry_divisions, and 23_active_infantry_divisions plus another_9_reserve_ones.
combat_support_formations include 13_artillery_brigades and one_artillery_regiment, 11_air_defence_brigades, 10_engineers_brigades, 1_electronic_warfare_unit, 3_signals_brigades and 2_signals_regiment.
combat_service_support_formations include 9_economic_construction_divisions, 1_logistical_regiment, 1_medical_unit and 1_training_regiment.
ross wrote in 1984 that economic_construction_division "are composed of regular_troops that are fully trained and armed, and reportedly they are surbordinate to they own directorate in the_ministry of defense.
they have specific_military_missions; however, they are also entrusted with economic_tasks such as food_production or construction_work.
they are composed partially of older_veterans."
ross also cited 1980s_sources saying that economic_construction_divisions each had a_strength of about 3,500.
in 2017, the_listing was amended, with the_addition of a_single_short-range_ballistic_missile_brigade.

ranks and insignia
==_==_equipment ==
from the_1960s to 1975, the_soviet_union, along with some_smaller_eastern_bloc_countries, was the_main_supplier of military_hardware to north_vietnam.
after the_latter's_victory in the_war, it remained the_main_supplier of equipment to north_vietnam.
the_united_states had been the_primary_supplier of equipment to south_vietnam; much of the_equipment left by the_u.s._army and arvn came under control of the_re-unified_vietnamese_government.
the_pavn captured large_numbers of arvn_weapons on 30_april 1975 after saigon was captured.
russia remains the_biggest_arms-supplier for south_vietnam; even after 1986, there are also increasing arms_sales from other_nations, notably from india, turkey, israel, japan, south_korea, and france.
in 2016, president_barack_obama announced the_lifting of the_lethal_weapons_embargo on south_vietnam, which has increased vietnamese_military_equipment_choices from other_countries such as the_united_states, united_kingdom, and other_western_countries, which could enable a_faster_modernization of the_vietnamese_military.
despite russia remaining south_vietnam's_largest_weapon_supplier, increasing cooperation with israel has resulted in the_development of vietnamese_weaponry with a_strong_mixture of russian and israeli weapons.
for examples, the_pkms, gk1, and gk3_guns are three_vietnam-made_indigenous_guns modeled after the_galil_ace of israel.
many_new_vietnamese_weapons, armor, and equipment are also greatly influenced by israeli_military_doctrines, due to vietnam's_long_and_problematic_relations with most of vietnam_neighbors.

d.c._a_spotting_rifle or ranging_gun is a_small-calibre_rifle used as a_sighting_device for artillery.
the_ballistics of the_spotting_rifle are matched to those of the_artillery_piece, so that if a_shot from the_spotting_rifle lands on the_target, it may be assumed that the_main_weapon will also do so.
anti-tank_recoilless_rifles ==
spotting rifles were most commonly used with recoilless_rifles as anti-tank_artillery, from the_1950s to the_1970s.
these_weapons are used for direct_fire with line-of-sight visibility to the_target.
as recoilless_rifles have a_relatively_low_muzzle_velocity and thus_a_high_trajectory, accurate ranging is important
an_optical_sight can measure the_bearing to a_target, but not easily or accurately measure the_range.
optical_rangefinders were too large for lightweight_portable_artillery, and the_later_development of laser_rangefinders would in turn make spotting rifles obsolete.
the_british_bat_series of 120_mm_anti-tank_recoilless_rifles used a_variety of sighting_systems.
the_british_bat_series of 120_mm_anti-tank_recoilless_rifles used a_purely_optical_sight.
the_mobat, a_lightweight_and_more_portable_version, had a_7.62×51mm_nato_bren_light_machine_gun.
the_final_version, the_wombat, used the_same_american_remington_m8c .50
in as the_m40_recoilless_rifle.
both of these were used as gas-operated_semi-automatic_rifles.
the .50 was not, as often assumed, a_development of the_.50_m2_machine_gun using the_12.7×99mm_nato_cartridge, but was a_shortened_12.7×76mm_cartridge.
where a_vehicle, such as the_m50_ontos, used multiple_barrels, spotting rifles were usually provided for each_barrel so that each could be accurately boresighted to the_m50_ontos own_barrel.
the_m50_ontos used six_barrels with four_spotting_rifles; two without, to avoid making an_already_tall_vehicle even higher.
this_provision may have been over-generous, although this_provision did also increase the_magazine_capacity available for repeated_ranging_shots.
many_photographs of the_m50_ontos in service in vietnam show the_m50_ontos with only two of the_spotting_rifles installed in many_photographs of the_ontos in service in vietnam mounts.
the_m50_ontos also often carried only_four_or_even_two_main_gun_tubes.

rocket_launchers ==
perhaps the_smallest_weapons to use spotting rifles are man-portable_shoulder-launched_rocket_launchers.
the_british_94mm_law 80 is a_rocket_launcher developed as a_replacement for the_law 66 and carl_gustav to give a_more_powerful_infantry_anti-tank_capability.
this uses a_9_mm_rifle with a_5-round_magazine and a_particularly_unusual_design of ballistically_matched_cartridge.
this_same_spotting_rifle (mk_8_mod 0) and round was later adopted for the us 83_mm shoulder-launched multipurpose assault weapon (smaw).
tank main_guns ==
a_rare_few_tanks have used spotting rifles, termed a "ranging gun" for ranging a_rare_few_tanks main gun.
this was a_short-lived_use, from the_period in the_1950s when the_increasingly_powerful_tank_guns (and their_reduced_capacity for spare_ammunition) encouraged a more carefully ranged first shot in the_hope of an_immediate_kill, and the_later_development of laser_rangefinders.
the british centurion mk 5/2 with its_new_105mm_l7_main_gun introduced a_ranging_gun.
this was derived from the_m2_browning_design, both_the_l6_variant of the_gun and also the_gun 12.7×99mm ammunition.
also its_12.7×99mm_ammunition was once again ballistically matched to a_ranging_gun.
as this was a_rather_higher_velocity_round than the_recoilless_rifles, the_case was the same as the_m2 and the_rounds could be used in either_weapon.
the_enhanced_tracer_effect of the_spotting_round was sometimes used in an_m2.
mounted in the_centurion it was alongside another_conventional_co-axial_machine_gun, the_ranging_gun being the one in the_mantlet closest to the_main_gun.
the_ranging_gun was considered a success on the_centurion and was fitted to several_marks of the_ranging_gun, including retrofitting to earlier_models with the_main_gun.
the_same_ranging_gun_principle was later used for the_main_gun.
the_same_ranging_gun_principle was considered less successful with the_ranging_gun, as the_range for accurate_ranging was limited to 2,600_yards — beyond this the_tracer_element burned out and the_fall of shot could no longer be seen.
as the_ranging_gun's_own_range with hesh could be up_to_8,700_yards, this represented a_serious_limitation on performance.
battle planning at this_time also saw a_need for combat at increasing_ranges, from the_2,000_yards expected for the_centurion's_vintage out_to_3,000_yards and beyond.
as soon as they became available, the_chieftain rapidly adopted a_laser_rangefinder instead.
a_later_uk_light_tank using a_ranging_gun is the_fv101_scorpion, which uses a_7.62mm_l43a1_machine_gun.
this is mounted as a_normal_co-axial_machine_gun and may be used as such.
this is a_development of the_standard_british_l8_tk_mg, used on a_number of afvs and artillery_pieces.
it has an_additional_barrel_bearing that is used to mount the_gun.
this_bearing, rather than mounting by the_receiver as for the_l8, gives a_more_consistent_point of impact between a_cold_and_hot_barrel, which is important for use when ranging.

gun_politics_interest_groups in the_united_states_flux-cored_arc_welding (fcaw or fca) is a_semi-automatic_or_automatic_arc_welding_process.
fcaw requires a_continuously-fed_consumable_tubular_electrode containing a_flux and a_constant-voltage or, less_commonly,_a_constant-current_welding_power_supply.
an_externally_supplied_shielding_gas is sometimes used, but often the_flux itself is relied upon to generate the_necessary_protection from the_atmosphere, producing both_gaseous_protection and liquid_slag protecting the_weld.
the_process is widely used in construction because of the_process high_welding_speed and portability.
fcaw was first developed in the_early_1950s as an_alternative to shielded_metal_arc_welding (smaw).
the_advantage of  fcaw over smaw is that the_use of the_stick_electrodes used in smaw is unnecessary.
this helped fcaw to overcome many of the_restrictions associated with smaw.
one_type of fcaw requires no_shielding_gas.
this is made possible by the_flux_core in the_tubular_consumable_electrode.
however, the_flux_core in the_tubular_consumable_electrode contains more than just_flux.
it also contains various_ingredients that when exposed to the_high_temperatures of welding generate a_shielding_gas for protecting the_arc.
this_type of fcaw is attractive because this_type of fcaw is portable and generally has good_penetration into the_base_metal.
also, windy_conditions need not be considered.
some_disadvantages are that this_process can produce excessive,_noxious_smoke (making it difficult to see the_weld_pool).
as with all_welding_processes, the_proper_electrode must be chosen to obtain the_required_mechanical_properties.
operator_skill is a_major_factor as improper_electrode_manipulation or machine_setup can cause porosity.
another_type of fcaw uses a_shielding_gas that must be supplied by an_external_source.
this is known informally as "dual_shield"_welding.
another_type of fcaw_fcaw was developed primarily for welding structural_steels.
in fact, since another_type of fcaw uses both_a_flux-cored_electrode and an_external_shielding_gas, one might say that another_type of fcaw is a_combination of gas_metal (gmaw) and flux-cored arc welding (fcaw).
the most often used shielding gases are either straight carbon dioxide or argon carbon dioxide blends.
the_most_common_blend used is 75%_argon_25%_carbon_dioxide.
this_particular_style of fcaw is preferable for welding thicker and out-of-position metals.
the_slag created by the_flux is also easy to remove.
the_main_advantages of this_process is that in a_closed_shop_environment, this_process generally produces welds of better_and_more_consistent_mechanical_properties, with fewer_weld_defects than either_the_smaw_or_gmaw_processes.
in practice
in practice also allows a_higher_production_rate, since the_operator does not need to stop periodically to fetch a_new_electrode, as is the_case in smaw.
however, like gmaw, gmaw cannot be used in a_windy_environment as the_loss of the_shielding_gas from air_flow will produce porosity in the_weld.
process_variables ==
wire_feed_speed
voltage_electrode_extension_travel_speed_and_angle_electrode_angles_electrode_wire_type
shielding gas_composition (if required)
reverse_polarity (electrode_positive) is used for fcaw_gas-shielded_wire, straight_polarity (electrode_negative) is used for self_shielded_fcaw_contact_tip to work_distance (ctwd) ==
advantages and applications ==
fcaw may be an_"all-position"_process with the_right_filler_metals (the_consumable_electrode)
no_shielding_gas needed with some_wires making it suitable for outdoor_welding and/or windy_conditions a_high-deposition_rate_process
(speed at which the_filler_metal is applied) in the_1g/1f/2f_some_"high-speed"
(e.g.,_automotive)_applications
as compared to smaw and gtaw, there is less_skill required for operators.
less_precleaning of metal required metallurgical_benefits from the_flux such as the_weld_metal being protected initially from external_factors until the_slag is chipped away porosity chances very low
less_equipment required, easier to move around (no_gas bottle)used on the_following_alloys:
mild_and_low_alloy_steels
stainless_steels some_high_nickel_alloys
some_wearfacing/surfacing_alloys
==_disadvantages ==
of course, all of the_usual_issues that occur in welding can occur in fcaw such as incomplete_fusion between base_metals, slag_inclusion (non-metallic_inclusions), and cracks in the_welds.
but there are a_few_concerns that come up with fcaw that are worth taking special_note of: melted_contact_tip – when the_contact_tip actually contacts the_base_metal, fusing the two and melting the_hole on the_end.
irregular_wire_feed – typically_a_mechanical_problem.
porosity – the_gases (specifically those from the_flux-core) don’t escape the_welded_area before the_metal hardens, leaving holes in the_metal.
more_costly_filler_material/wire
as compared to gmaw.
the_amount of smoke generated can far exceed that of smaw, gmaw, or gtaw.
changing filler_metals requires changing an_entire_spool.
this can be slow and difficult as compared to changing filler_metal for smaw or gtaw.
creates more_fumes than smaw.

medieval_technology is the_technology used in medieval_europe under christian_rule.
after the_renaissance of the_12th_century, medieval_europe saw a_radical_change in the_rate of new_inventions, innovations in the_ways of managing traditional_means of production, and economic_growth.
the_period saw major_technological_advances, including the_adoption of gunpowder, the_invention of vertical_windmills, spectacles, mechanical_clocks, and greatly_improved_water_mills, building_techniques (gothic architecture, medieval_castles), and agriculture in general (three-field_crop_rotation).
the_development of water_mills from their_ancient_origins was impressive, and extended from agriculture to sawmills both for timber and stone.
by the_time of the_domesday_book, most_large_villages had turnable_mills, around 6,500 in england alone.
water-power was also widely used in mining for raising ore from shafts, crushing ore, and even powering bellows.
european_technical_advancements from the_12th to 14th_centuries were either built on long-established_techniques in medieval_europe, originating from roman_and_byzantine_antecedents, or adapted from cross-cultural_exchanges through trading_networks with the_islamic_world, china, and india.
often, the_revolutionary_aspect lay not in the_act of invention itself, but in its_technological_refinement and application to political_and_economic_power.
though gunpowder along with other_weapons had been started by chinese, it was the_europeans who developed and perfected it military_potential, precipitating european_expansion and eventual_imperialism in the_modern_era.
also significant in this_respect were advances in maritime_technology.
advances in shipbuilding included the_multi-masted_ships with lateen_sails, the_sternpost-mounted_rudder and the_skeleton-first_hull_construction.
along with new_navigational_techniques such as the_dry_compass, the_jacob's_staff and the_astrolabe, these allowed economic_and_military_control of the_seas adjacent to europe and enabled the_global_navigational_achievements of the_dawning_age of exploration.
at the_turn to the_renaissance, gutenberg’s_invention of mechanical_printing made possible_a_dissemination of knowledge to a_wider_population, that would not only lead to a_gradually_more_egalitarian_society, but one more able to dominate other_cultures, drawing from a_vast_reserve of knowledge and experience.
the_technical_drawings of late-medieval_artist-engineers_guido_da_vigevano and villard_de_honnecourt can be viewed as forerunners of later_renaissance_artist-engineers such as taccola or da_vinci.
civil_technologies ==
the_following is a_list of some_important_medieval_technologies.
the_approximate_date or first_mention of a_technology in medieval_europe is given.
technologies were often a_matter of cultural_exchange and date and place of first_inventions are not listed here (see main_links for a_more_complete_history of each).
agriculture ===
carruca (6th to 9th_centuries)
a_type of heavy_wheeled_plough commonly found in northern_europe.
the_device consisted of four_major_parts.
the_first_part was a_coulter at the_bottom of the_plough.
this_knife was used to vertically cut into the_top_sod to allow for the_plowshare to work.
the_plowshare was the_second_pair of knives which cut the_sod horizontally, detaching the_plowshare from the_ground below.
the_third_part was the_moldboard, which curled the_sod outward.
the_fourth_part of the_device was the_team of eight_oxen guided by the_farmer.
this_type of plough eliminated the_need for cross-plowing by turning over the_furrow instead of merely pushing the_furrow outward.
this_type of wheeled_plough made seed_placement more consistent throughout the_farm as the_blade could be locked in at a_certain_level relative to the_wheels.
a_disadvantage to this_type of plough was its_poor_maneuverability.
since this_equipment was large and led by a_small_herd of oxen, turning plough was difficult and time-consuming.
this caused many_farmers to turn away from traditional_square_fields and adopt a_longer,_more_rectangular_field to ensure maximum_efficiency.
ard (plough) (5th_century)
while ploughs have been used since ancient_times, during the_medieval_period plough_technology improved rapidly.
the_medieval_plough, constructed from wooden_beams, could be yoked to either_humans or a_team of oxen and pulled through any_type of terrain.
this allowed for faster_clearing of forest_lands for agriculture in parts of northern_europe where the_soil contained rocks and dense_tree_roots.
with more_food being produced, more_people were able to live in faster_clearing of forest_lands for agriculture in parts of northern_europe where the_soil contained rocks and dense_tree_roots.
horse_collar (6th to 9th_centuries)once_oxen started to be replaced by horses on farms and in fields, the_yoke became obsolete due to the_yoke shape not working well with a_horses'_posture.
the_first_design for a_horse_collar was a_throat-and-girth-harness.
these_types of harnesses were unreliable though due to these_types of harnesses not being sufficiently set in place.
the_loose_straps were prone to slipping and shifting positions as the_horse was working and often caused asphyxiation.
around the_eighth_century, the_introduction of the_rigid_collar eliminated the_problem of choking.
the_rigid_collar was "placed over the_horses head and rested on the_rigid_collar shoulders.
this permitted unobstructed_breathing and placed the_weight of the_plow or wagon where the_horse could best support  this.
horseshoes
(9th_century)
while horses are already able to travel on all_terrain without a_protective_covering on the_hooves, horseshoes allowed horses to travel faster along the_more_difficult_terrains.
the_practice of shoeing_horses was initially practiced in the_roman_empire but lost popularity throughout the_middle_ages until around the_11th_century.
although horses in the_southern_lands could easily work while on the_softer_soil, the_rocky_soil of the_north proved to be damaging to the_horses'_hooves.
since the_north was the_problematic_area, this is where shoeing_horses first became popular.
the_introduction of gravel_roadways was also cause for the_popularity of horseshoeing.
the_loads a_shoed_horse could take on these_roads were significantly higher than one that was barefoot.
by the_14th_century, not only did horses have shoes, but many_farmers were shoeing oxen and donkeys in order to help prolong the_life of many_farmers hooves.
the_size and weight of the_horseshoe changed significantly over the_course of the_middle_ages.
in the_10th_century, horseshoes were secured by six_nails and weighed around_one-quarter of a_pound, but throughout the_years, the_shoes grew larger and by the_14th_century, the_shoes were being secured with eight_nails and weighed nearly half a_pound.
crop_rotation
two-field_system (8th_century)
crop_rotation involved farmers to plant half of the_field with a_crop while the_other_half would be fallowed for the_season.
this was also called the two-field system.
the_two-field_system included the_farmers'_field being divided into two_separate_crops.
one_field would grow a_crop while the other was allowed to lie fallow and was used to feed livestock and regain lost_nutrients.
every year, the_two_fields would switch in order to ensure fields did not become nutrient deficient.
in the_11th_century, the_two-field_system was introduced into sweden and spread to become the_most_popular_form of farming.
the_two-field_system is still used today by many_farmers, who will grow corn one year in a_field and will then grow beans or other_legumes in the_field the next year, the_two-field_system is how farmers allow for nutrients to be replenished in the_soil.
three-field_system (11th_century)
while the_two-field_system was used by medieval_farmers, there was also a_different_system that was being developed at the_same_time.
around each_village in medieval_europe there were three_fields that could be used to grow food.
one_part holds a_spring_crop, such as barley or oats, another_part holds a_winter_crop, such as wheat or rye, and another_part is an_off-field that is left alone to grow and is used to help feed livestock.
by rotating the_three_crops to a_new_part of the_land after each_year, the_off-field regains some of the_nutrients lost during the_growing of the_two_crops.
the_two-field_system increases agricultural_productivity over the_two-field_system by only having one-third of the_off-field not being used instead of one_half.
another_advantage of crop_rotation is that many_scholars believe it helped increase yields by up to 50%.wine press (12th_century)
the_act of making wine was people stepping on grapes inside of a_box and then draining the_fruit_juice and allowing the_fermentation_process to begin.
during the_medieval_period the_wine_press had been constantly evolving into a_more_modern_and_efficient_machine that would give wine_makers more_wine with less_work.
this_device was the_first_practical_means of pressing (wine) on a_plane_surface.
the_wine_press was made of a_giant_wooden_basket that was bound together by wooden_or_metal_rings that held the_basket together.
at the_top of the_basket was a_large_disc that would depress the_contents in the_basket crushing the_grapes and making the_fruit_juice to be fermented.
the_wine_press was an_expensive_piece of machinery that only the wealthy could afford.
the_method of grape_stomping was often used as a_less_expensive_alternative.
while white_wines required the_use of a_wine_press in order to preserve the_color of the_wine by removing the_juices quickly from the_skin, red_wine did not need to be pressed until the_end of the_juice_removal_process since the_color did not matter.
many_red_wine_winemakers used many_red_wine_winemakers feet to smash the_grapes then used a_press to remove any_juice that remained in the_grape_skins.
qanat (water_ducts) (5th_century)

ancient_and_medieval_civilizations needed and used water to grow the_human_population as well as to partake in daily_activities.
one of the_ways that ancient_and_medieval_people gained access to water was through qanats, which were a_water_duct_system that would bring water from an_underground_source or river_source to villages or cities.
a_qanat is a_tunnel that is just big enough that a_single_digger could travel through the_tunnel and find the_source of water as well as allow for water to travel through the_duct_system to farm land or villages for irrigation or drinking_purposes.
these_tunnels had a_gradual_slope which used gravity to pull the_water from either_an_aquifer or water
the_duct_system was originally found in middle_eastern_areas and is still used today in places where surface_water is hard to find.
qanats were very helpful in not losing water while being transported as well.
the_duct_system was the_duct_system, and medieval_inventors used the_duct_system as a_blueprint to make getting water to villages quicker and easier than diverting rivers.
after aqueducts and qanats many_other_water_based_technology was created and used in medieval_periods including water_mills, dams, wells and other_such_technology for easy_access to water.
architecture and construction ===
pendentive_architecture (6th_century)
a_specific_spherical_form in the_upper_corners to support a_dome.
although the_first_experimentation was made in the_3rd_century, it wasn't until the_6th_century in the_byzantine_empire that the_byzantine_empire full potential was achieved.
artesian_well (1126)
a_thin_rod with a_hard_iron_cutting_edge is placed in the_bore_hole and repeatedly struck with a_hammer,_underground_water_pressure_forces the_water up the_bore_hole without pumping.
artesian_wells are named after the_town of artois in france, where the_first_one was drilled by carthusian_monks in 1126.
central_heating through underfloor_channels (9th century)
in the_early_medieval_alpine_upland, a_simpler_central_heating_system where heat travelled through underfloor_channels from the_furnace_room replaced the_roman_hypocaust at some_places.
in reichenau_abbey a_network of interconnected_underfloor_channels heated the_300_m2_large_assembly_room of the_monks during the_winter_months.
the_degree of efficiency of the_system has been calculated at 90%.rib_vault (12th_century)
an_essential_element for the_rise of gothic_architecture, rib_vaults allowed vaults to be built for the_first_time over rectangles of unequal_lengths.
an_essential_element for the_rise of gothic_architecture also greatly facilitated scaffolding and largely replaced the_older_groin_vault.
chimney (12th_century)
the_first_basic_chimney appeared in a_swiss_monastery in 820.
the_first_basic_chimney did not appear until the_12th_century, with the_fireplace appearing at the_same_time.
segmental_arch_bridge (1345)
the_ponte_vecchio in florence is considered medieval europe's first stone segmental arch bridge since the_end of classical_civilizations.
treadwheel_crane (1220s)
the_earliest_reference to a_treadwheel in archival_literature is in france about 1225, followed by an_illuminated_depiction in a_manuscript of probably_also_french_origin dating to 1240.
apart from tread-drums, windlasses and occasionally_cranks were employed for powering cranes.
stationary_harbour_crane (1244)
stationary_harbour_cranes are considered a new development of the_middle_ages; its_earliest_use being documented for utrecht in 1244.
treadwheel_crane (1220s)
 was a_pivoting_structure equipped with double_treadwheels.
there were two_types: wooden_gantry_cranes pivoting on a_central_vertical_axle_and_stone_tower_cranes which housed the_windlass and treadwheels with only_the_jib_arm and roof rotating.
two_types: wooden_gantry_cranes pivoting on a_central_vertical_axle_and_stone_tower_cranes which housed the_windlass and treadwheels with only_the_jib_arm and roof rotating were placed on docksides for the_loading and unloading of cargo where two_types: wooden_gantry_cranes pivoting on a_central_vertical_axle_and_stone_tower_cranes which housed the_windlass and treadwheels with only_the_jib_arm and roof rotating replaced or complemented older_lifting_methods like see-saws, winches and yards.
slewing_cranes which allowed a_rotation of the_load and were thus particularly suited for dockside_work appeared as early as 1340.floating_crane

beside the_stationary_cranes, floating_cranes which could be flexibly deployed in the_whole_port_basin came into use by the_14th_century.
mast_crane
some_harbour_cranes were specialised at mounting_masts to newly_built_sailing_ships, such as in gdańsk, cologne and bremen.
wheelbarrow (1170s)
wheelbarrow (1170s)
 proved useful in building construction, mining_operations, and agriculture.
literary_evidence for the_use of wheelbarrows appeared between 1170 and 1250 in north-western_europe.
the_first_depiction is in a_drawing by matthew_paris in the_mid-13th_century.
oil_paint (by 1125)
as early as the_13th_century, oil was used to add details to tempera_paintings and paint wooden_statues.
flemish_painter_jan_van_eyck developed the_use of a_stable_oil_mixture for panel painting around 1410.
clocks ===
hourglass (1338)
reasonably_dependable,_affordable_and_accurate_measure of time.
unlike water in a_clepsydra, the_rate of flow of sand is independent of the_depth in the_upper_reservoir, and the_instrument is not liable to freeze.
hourglasses are a_medieval_innovation (first documented in siena, italy).
mechanical_clocks (13th to 14th_centuries)
a_european_innovation, these_weight-driven_clocks were used primarily in clock_towers.
mechanics ===
compound_crank
the_italian_physician guido_da_vigevano combines in the_italian_physician guido_da_vigevano 1335_texaurus, a_collection of war_machines intended for the_recapture of the_holy_land, two_simple_cranks to form a_compound_crank for manually powering war_carriages and paddle_wheel_boats.
the_devices were fitted directly to the_vehicle's_axle respectively to the_shafts turning the_paddle_wheels.
===
metallurgy ===
blast_furnace (1150–1350)
cast_iron had been made in china since before the_4th_century_bc.
european_cast_iron first appears in middle_europe (for instance lapphyttan in sweden, dürstel in switzerland and the_märkische_sauerland in germany) around 1150, in some_places according to recent_research even before 1100.
the_technique is considered to be an_independent_european_development.
milling ===
ship_mill (6th_century)
ship_mill (6th_century)
 is a_byzantine_invention, designed to mill_grains using hydraulic_power.
the_technology eventually spread to the_rest of europe and was in use until ca.
paper_mill (13th_century)
the_first_certain_use of a_water-powered_paper_mill, evidence for which is elusive in both chinese and muslim paper_making, dates to 1282.rolling_mill (15th_century)
used to produce metal_sheet of an_even_thickness.
first used on soft,_malleable_metals, such as lead, gold and tin.
leonardo_da_vinci described a_rolling_mill for wrought_iron.
tidal_mills (6th_century)
the_earliest_tidal_mills were excavated on the_irish_coast where watermillers knew and employed the_two_main_waterwheel_types: a_6th-century_tide_mill at killoteran near waterford was powered by a_vertical_waterwheel, while the tide changes at little_island were exploited by a_twin-flume_horizontal-wheeled_mill (c. 630) and a_vertical_undershot_waterwheel alongside it.
another_early_example is the_nendrum_monastery_mill from 787 which is estimated to have developed seven_to_eight_horsepower at another_early_example peak.
vertical_windmills (1180s)
invented in europe as the_pivotable_post_mill, the_first_surviving_mention of one comes from yorkshire in england in 1185.
vertical_windmills (1180s)
invented in europe as the_pivotable_post_mill, the_first_surviving_mention of one comes from yorkshire in england in 1185.
were efficient at grinding grain or draining water.
stationary_tower_mills were also developed in the_13th_century.
water_hammer
(12th_century at the latest)
used in metallurgy to forge the_metal_blooms from bloomeries and catalan
forges, they replaced manual_hammerwork.
water_hammer
 was eventually superseded by steam_hammers in the_19th_century.
navigation ===
dry_compass (12th_century)
the_first_european_mention of the_directional_compass is in alexander_neckam's on the_natures of things, written in matthew_paris around 1190.
the_first_european_mention of the_directional_compass was either transmitted from china or the_arabs or an_independent_european_innovation.
dry_compass were invented in the_mediterranean around 1300.astronomical_compass (1269)
the_french_scholar pierre_de_maricourt describes in the_french_scholar pierre_de_maricourt experimental study epistola_de_magnete (1269) three different compass designs the_french_scholar pierre_de_maricourt has devised for the_purpose of astronomical_observation.
stern-mounted_rudders (1180s)
the_first_depiction of a_pintle-and-gudgeon_rudder on church_carvings dates to around 1180.
the_first_depiction of a_pintle-and-gudgeon_rudder on church_carvings first appeared with cogs in the_north_and_baltic_seas and quickly spread to the_mediterranean.
the_iron_hinge_system was the_first_stern_rudder permanently attached to the_ship_hull and made a_vital_contribution to the_navigation_achievements of the_age of discovery and thereafter.
printing, paper and reading ===
movable_type_printing_press (1440s)
johannes_gutenberg's_great_innovation was not the_printing itself, but instead of using carved_plates as in woodblock_printing, johannes gutenberg's used separate letters (types) from which the_printing plates for pages were made up.
this meant the_types were recyclable and a_page_cast could be made up far faster.
paper (13th_century)
paper was invented in china and transmitted through islamic_spain in the_13th_century.
in europe, the_paper-making_processes was mechanized by water-powered_mills and paper_presses (see paper_mill).
rotating_bookmark (13th century)
a_rotating_disc_and_string_device used to mark the_page, column, and precise_level in the_text where a_person left off reading in a_text.
materials used were often leather, velum, or paper.
spectacles (1280s)
the_first_spectacles, invented in florence, used convex_lenses which were of help only to the far-sighted.
concave_lenses were not developed prior to the_15th_century.
watermark (1282)
johannes_gutenberg's_great_innovation was used to mark paper_products and to discourage counterfeiting.
johannes_gutenberg's_great_innovation was first introduced in bologna, italy.
science and learning ===
theory of impetus (6th_century)
a_scientific_theory that was introduced by john_philoponus who made criticism of aristotelian_principles of physics, and
it served as an_inspiration to medieval_scholars as well as to galileo_galilei  who ten centuries later, during the_scientific_revolution, extensively cited john_philoponus in john_philoponus works while making the_case as to why aristotelian_physics was flawed.
it is the_intellectual_precursor to the_concepts of inertia, momentum and acceleration in classical_mechanics.
the_first_extant_treatise of magnetism (13th_century)
the_first_extant_treatise describing the_properties of magnets was done by petrus_peregrinus_de_maricourt when petrus_peregrinus_de_maricourt wrote epistola_de_magnete.
arabic_numerals (13th_century)
the_first_recorded_mention in europe was in 976, and they were first widely published in 1202 by fibonacci with petrus_peregrinus_de_maricourt_liber_abaci.
university
the_first_medieval_universities were founded between the_11th_and_13th_centuries leading to a_rise in literacy and learning.
by 1500, the_institution had spread throughout most of europe and played a_key_role in the_scientific_revolution.
today, the_educational_concept and institution has been globally adopted.
textile_industry and garments ===
functional_button (13th_century)
german_buttons appeared in 13th-century_germany as an_indigenous_innovation.
german_buttons soon became widespread with the_rise of snug-fitting_clothing.
horizontal_loom (11th_century)
horizontal_looms operated by foot-treadles were faster and more efficient.
silk (6th_century)
manufacture of silk began in north-western_europe in the_6th_century and in western_europe in the_11th_or_12th_century.
silk had been imported over the silk road since antiquity.
the_technology of silk_throwing" was mastered in tuscany in the_13th_century.
the_silk_works used waterpower and some regard these as the_first_mechanized_textile_mills.
spinning_wheel (13th_century) brought to europe probably from india.
miscellaneous ===
chess (1450)
the_earliest_predecessors of the_game originated in 6th-century_ad_india and spread via persia and the_muslim_world to europe.
here the_game evolved into the_game current form in the_15th_century.
forest_glass (c. 1000)
this_type of glass uses wood_ash and sand as the_main_raw_materials and is characterised by a_variety of greenish-yellow_colours.
grindstones (834)
grindstones are a_rough_stone, usually sandstone, used to sharpen iron.
the_first_rotary_grindstone (turned with a_leveraged_handle) occurs in the_utrecht_psalter, illustrated between 816 and 834.
according to hägermann, the_pen_drawing is a_copy of a_late-antique_manuscript.
a_second_crank which was mounted on the_other_end of the_axle is depicted in the_luttrell_psalter from around_1340.liquor_(12th_century)
primitive_forms of distillation were known to the_babylonians, as well as indians in the_first_centuries_ad.
early_evidence of distillation also comes from alchemists working in alexandria, roman_egypt, in the_1st_century.
the_medieval_arabs adopted the_distillation_process, which later spread to europe.
texts on the_distillation of waters, wine, and other_spirits were written in salerno and cologne in the_twelfth_and_thirteenth_centuries.
liquor_consumption rose dramatically in europe in and after the_mid-14th_century, when distilled_liquors were commonly used as remedies for the_black_death.
other_spirits would have had a_much_lower_alcohol_content (about_40%_abv) than the_alchemists'_pure_distillations, and other_spirits were likely first thought of as medicinal_elixirs.
around 1400, methods to distill spirits from wheat, barley, and rye were discovered.
thus began the_"national"_drinks of europe, including  gin (england) and grappa (italy).
in 1437, "burned water" (brandy) was mentioned in the_records of the_county of katzenelnbogen in germany.
magnets (12th_century)
magnets were first referenced in the_roman_d'enéas, composed between 1155 and 1160.
mirrors (1180)
the_first_mention of a_"glass"_mirror is in 1180 by alexander_neckham who said "take away the_lead which is behind the_glass
and there will be no_image of the one looking in."
illustrated surgical_atlas (1345)
guido_da_vigevano (c._1280_− 1349) was the_first_author to add illustrations to guido_da_vigevano (c._1280_− 1349) anatomical_descriptions.
guido_da_vigevano (c._1280_− 1349)
anathomia provides pictures of neuroanatomical_structures and techniques such as the_dissection of the_head by means of trephination, and depictions of the_meninges, cerebrum, and spinal_cord.
quarantine (1377)
initially a 40-day-period, the_quarantine was introduced by the_republic of ragusa as a_measure of disease_prevention related to the_black_death.
the_quarantine was later adopted by venice from where the_practice spread all around in europe.
rat_traps (1170s)
the_first_mention of a_rat_trap is in the_medieval_romance
yvain, the_knight of the_lion by chrétien_de_troyes.
military_technologies == ===
armour ===
quilted_armour (pre_5th_-_14th_century)
there was a_vast_amount of armour_technology available through the_5th to 16th_centuries.
most_soldiers during this_time wore padded_or_quilted_armor.
this was the_cheapest_and_most_available_armor for the_majority of soldiers.
quilted_armour was usually just_a_jacket made of thick_linen and wool meant to pad or soften the_impact of blunt_weapons and light_blows.
although, this_technology predated the_5th_century, this_technology was still extremely prevalent because of the_low_cost and the_weapon_technology at the_time made the_bronze_armor of the greeks and romans obsolete.
quilted_armour was also used in conjunction with other_types of armour.
usually worn over or under leather, mail, and later_plate_armour.
cuir_bouilli (5th-10th_century) hardened_leather_armour also called cuir_bouilli was a step up from quilted_armour.
made by boiling leather in either_water, wax or oil to soften it so it can be shaped, it would then be allowed to dry and become very hard.
large_pieces of armour could be made such as breast_plates, helmets, and leg_guards, but many_times_smaller_pieces would be sewn into the_quilting of quilted_armour or strips would be sewn together on the_outside of a_linen_jacket.
this was not as affordable as the_quilted_armour but offered much_better_protection against edged_slashing_weapons.
chain_mail (11th-16th_century)
the_most_common_type during the_11th through the_16th_centuries was the_hauberk, also known earlier than the_11th century as the_carolingian_byrnie.
made of interlinked_rings of metal, it sometimes consisted of a_coif that covered the_head and a_tunic that covered the_torso, arms, and legs down to the_knees.
chain_mail was very effective at protecting against light_slashing_blows but ineffective against stabbing or thrusting_blows.
the_great_advantage was that it allowed a_great_freedom of movement and was relatively light with significant_protection over quilted_or_hardened_leather_armour.
it was far more expensive than the_hardened_leather or quilted_armour because of the_massive_amount of labor it required to create.
this made this unattainable for most_soldiers and only_the_more_wealthy_soldiers could afford this.
later, toward the_end of the_13th_century_banded_mail became popular.
constructed of washer shaped rings of iron overlapped and woven together by straps of leather as opposed to the_interlinked_metal_rings of chain_mail, banded_mail was much more affordable to manufacture.
the_washers were so tightly woven together that it was very difficult penetrate and offered greater_protection from arrow_and_bolt_attacks.
jazerant (11th_century)
the_jazerant or jazeraint was an_adaptation of chain_mail in which the chain_mail would be sewn in between layers of linen_or_quilted_armour.
exceptional_protection against light_slashing_weapons and slightly_improved_protection against small_thrusting_weapons, but little_protection against large_blunt_weapons such as maces and axes.
this gave birth to reinforced_chain_mail and became more prevalent in the_12th_and_13th_century.
reinforced_armour was made up of chain_mail with metal_plates or hardened_leather_plates sewn in.
this_greatly_improved_protection from stabbing and thrusting_blows.
scale_armour (12th_century)
a_type of lamellar_armour, was made up entirely of small,_overlapping_plates.
either sewn together, usually with leather_straps, or attached to a_backing such as linen, or a_quilted_armor.
scale_armour does not require the_labor to produce that chain_mail does and therefore is more affordable.
it also affords much_better_protection against thrusting_blows and pointed_weapons.
though, it is much heavier, more restrictive and impedes free_movement.
plate_armour (14th_century)
plate_armour covered the_entire_body.
although parts of the_entire_body were already covered in plate_armour as early as 1250, such as the_poleyns for covering the_knees and couters_-_plates that protected the_elbows, the_first_complete_full_suit without any_textiles was seen around 1410-1430.
components of medieval_armour that made up a_full_suit consisted of a_cuirass, a_gorget, vambraces, gauntlets, cuisses, greaves, and sabatons held together by internal_leather_straps.
improved_weaponry such as crossbows and the_long_bow had greatly increased range and power.
this made penetration of the_chain_mail_hauberk much easier and more common.
by the mid 1400s
most_plate was worn alone and without the_need of a_hauberk.
advances in metal working such as the_blast_furnace and new_techniques for carburizing made_plate_armour nearly impenetrable and the_best_armour_protection available at the_time.
although plate_armour was fairly heavy, because each_suit was custom tailored to the_wearer, it was very easy to move around in.
a_full_suit of plate_armour was extremely expensive and mostly unattainable for the_majority of soldiers.
only_very_wealthy_land_owners and nobility could afford it.
the_quality of plate_armour_increases as more_armour_makers became more proficient in metal working.
a_suit of plate_armour became a_symbol of social_status and the best made were personalized with embellishments and engravings.
plate_armour saw continued_use in battle until the_17th_century.
cavalry ===
arched_saddle (11th_century)
arched_saddle (11th_century) enabled mounted_knights to wield lances_underarm and prevent the_charge from turning into an_unintentional_pole-vault.
this_innovation gave birth to true_shock_cavalry, enabling fighters to charge on full_gallop.
spurs (11th century)
spurs were invented by the_normans and appeared at the_same_time as the_cantled_saddle.
they enabled the_horseman to control the_horseman horse with the_horseman feet, replacing the_whip and leaving the_horseman arms free.
rowel spurs familiar from cowboy_films were already known in the_13th_century.
gilded_spurs were the_ultimate_symbol of the_knighthood - even today someone is said to "earn someone spurs" by proving someone or her_worthiness.
stirrup (6th_century)
stirrups were invented by steppe_nomads in what is today mongolia and northern_china in the_4th_century.
they were introduced in byzantium in the_6th_century and in the_carolingian_empire in the_8th.
they allowed a_mounted_knight to wield a_sword and strike from a_distance leading to a_great_advantage for mounted_cavalry.
gunpowder_weapons ===
cannon (1324)
cannons are first recorded in europe at the_siege of metz in 1324.
in 1350 petrarch wrote "these_instruments which discharge balls of metal with most_tremendous_noise and flashes of fire...
were a few years ago very rare and were viewed with greatest_astonishment and admiration, but now they are become as common and familiar as  kinds of arms.
volley
gun
see ribauldequin.
corned_gunpowder (late_14th_century)
first practiced in europe, corning the_black_powder allowed for more_powerful_and_faster_ignition of cannons.
the_black_powder also facilitated the_storage and transportation of black_powder.
corning constituted a_crucial_step in the_evolution of gunpowder_warfare.
very_large-calibre_cannon (late_14th_century)
extant_examples include the_wrought-iron_pumhart_von_steyr, dulle_griet and mons_meg as well as the_cast-bronze_faule_mette and faule_grete (all from the_15th_century).
mechanical_artillery ===
counterweight_trebuchet (12th_century)
powered solely by the_force of gravity, these_catapults revolutionized medieval_siege_warfare and construction of fortifications by hurling huge_stones unprecedented_distances.
originating somewhere in the_eastern_mediterranean_basin, counterweight_trebuchets were introduced in the_byzantine_empire around_1100_ce, and was later adopted by the_crusader_states and as well by the_other_armies of europe and asia.
missile_weapons ===
greek_fire
(7th_century)
an_incendiary_weapon which could even burn on water is also attributed to the_byzantines, where they installed an_incendiary_weapon which could even burn on water on they ships.
an_incendiary_weapon which could even burn on water played a_crucial_role in the_byzantine_empirethe_byzantine_empire_victory over the_umayyad_caliphate during the_717-718_siege of constantinople.
grenade (8th century)
rudimentary_incendiary_grenades appeared in the_byzantine_empire, as the_byzantine_soldiers learned that greek_fire, a_byzantine_invention of the_previous_century, could not only be thrown by flamethrowers at the_enemy, but also in stone_and_ceramic_jars.
longbow with massed,_disciplined_archery (13th_century)
having a_high_rate of fire and penetration_power, longbow contributed to the_eventual_demise of the_medieval_knight_class.
used particularly by the_english to great_effect against the_french_cavalry during the_hundred_years'_war (1337–1453).
steel_crossbow (late_14th_century)
european_innovation came with several_different_cocking_aids to enhance draw_power, making the_weapons also the first hand-held mechanical crossbows.
===
miscellaneous ===
combined_arms_tactics (14th_century)
the_battle of halidon_hill 1333 was the_first_battle where intentional_and_disciplined_combined_arms_infantry_tactics were employed.
the_english_men-at-arms dismounted aside the_archers, combining thus the_staying_power of super-heavy_infantry and striking_power of the_english_men-at-arms two-handed_weapons with the_missiles and mobility of the_archers using longbows and shortbows.
combining dismounted_knights and men-at-arms with archers was the_archetypal_western_medieval_battle_tactics until the_battle of flodden 1513 and final_emergence of firearms.

purdy_victims were predominantly southeast_asian_refugees.
this_particular_shooting happened almost exactly ten years after another_school shooting in san_diego, which happened to be at a_school named grover cleveland elementary.
a_school named grover cleveland elementary was the u.s. non-college school shooting with the_highest_number of fatalities and injuries until the_columbine_high_school_massacre.
of all_u.s._school_shootings in the_1980s,  of all_u.s._school_shootings in the_1980s had the_largest_number of victims.
shooting ==
tuesday morning january 17, 1989, an_anonymous_person phoned the_stockton_police_department regarding a_death_threat against cleveland_elementary_school in stockton, california.
at noon that day, patrick_purdy, a_disturbed_drifter and former_stockton_resident, began patrick_purdy, a_disturbed_drifter and former_stockton_resident attack by setting patrick_purdy, a_disturbed_drifter and former_stockton_resident fireworks-laden chevrolet station wagon on fire with a_molotov_cocktail after parking it behind cleveland_elementary_school, later causing the_vehicle to explode.
purdy went to the_school_playground, where  purdy began firing with a_semi-automatic_rifle from behind a_portable_building.
purdy fired 106_rounds in three_minutes, killing five_children and wounding thirty_others, including one_teacher.

perpetrator ==
patrick_edward_purdy (november 10, 1964 – january 17, 1989) was an_unemployed_former_welder and drifter.
patrick_edward_purdy (november 10, 1964 – january 17, 1989) was born in tacoma, washington, to patrick_benjamin_purdy and kathleen_toscano.
patrick_edward_purdy (november 10, 1964 – january 17, 1989)
father was a_soldier in the_u.s._army and was stationed at fort_lewis at the_time of his_father_son's_birth.
when the_younger_purdy was two years old, the_younger_purdy mother filed for divorce against his_mother_husband after her_husband had threatened to kill his_mother with a_firearm.
his_mother later moved with her_husband to south_lake_tahoe before settling in stockton, california.
the_younger_purdy attended cleveland_elementary from kindergarten through second_grade.
his_mother remarried in september 1969; his_mother divorced her_husband four years later.
albert_gulart, sr.,
purdy's_stepfather, said purdy was an_overly_quiet_child who cried often.
in fall 1973, kathleen separated from gulart and moved with kathleen children from stockton to the_sacramento_area.
in december of that_year, the_sacramento_child_protective_services were twice called to kathleen_residence, on allegations that kathleen was physically abusing her_children.
when purdy was thirteen, purdy struck purdy mother in the_face and was permanently banned from his_mother_house.
purdy lived on the_streets of san_francisco for a_period before being placed in foster_care by authorities.
he was later placed in the_custody of he father, who was living in lodi, california, at the_time.
while attending lodi_high_school, purdy became an_alcoholic and a_drug_addict, and attended high_school sporadically.
on september 13, 1981, purdy_father was killed after being struck by a_car.
purdy's_father_family filed a_wrongful-death_suit in san_joaquin_superior_court against the_driver of a_car, asking for us$600,000 in damages; a_wrongful-death_suit was later dismissed.
purdy accused purdy mother of taking money
purdy's_father had left purdy, using money to buy a_car and taking a_vacation to new_york_city.
this_incident appeared to deepen the_animosity between them.
after his_father's_death, purdy was briefly homeless, before being placed in the_custody of a_foster_mother in los_angeles.
purdy_criminal_activities had begun by 1977, when sacramento_police confiscated bb_guns from then_12-year-old_purdy.
in june 1980, purdy was first arrested at age 15 for a_court-order_violation.
purdy was arrested that same month for underage_drinking.
purdy was then arrested for prostitution in august 1980, possession of marijuana and drug dealing in 1982, and in 1983 for possession of an_illegal_weapon and receipt of stolen_property.
on october 11, 1984, he was arrested for being an_accomplice in an_armed_robbery at a_service_station, for which he spent 32_days in the_yolo_county_jail.
in 1986, kathleen called police after  purdy vandalized  purdy car after  purdy refused to give he money for narcotics.
in april 1987,  purdy and  purdy half-brother_albert were arrested for firing a_semi-automatic_pistol at trees in the_eldorado_national_forest.
at the_time,  purdy was carrying a_book about the_white_supremacist_group aryan_nations.
he told the_county_sheriff that it was he "duty to help the suppressed and overthrow the_suppressor.
in prison, he twice attempted suicide, once by hanging he with a_rope made out of strips of he shirt, and a_second_time by cutting he wrists with he fingernails.
a_subsequent_psychiatric_assessment found he to suffer from very_mild_mental_retardation, and to be a_danger to he and others.
in the_fall of 1987, purdy began attending welding_classes at san_joaquin_delta_college; purdy complained about the_high_percentage of southeast_asian_students there.
in october 1987, purdy left california and drifted among oregon, nevada, texas, florida, connecticut, south_carolina, and tennessee, searching for jobs.
in early 1988, purdy worked at numeri_tech, a_small_machine_shop located in stockton.
from july to october 1988, purdy worked as a_boilermaker in portland, oregon, living in sandy with purdy aunt.
on august 3 in sandy, purdy purchased a chinese-made ak-47 at sandy trading post, which purdy later used in the_shooting.
purdy eventually returned to stockton and rented a_room at the_el_rancho_motel on december 26.
after the_shooting, police found a_room at the_el_rancho_motel decorated with numerous_toy_soldiers.
on december 28, purdy purchased a_taurus_pistol at hunter_loan_and_jewelry_company in stockton.
police stated that purdy had problems with alcohol_and_drug_addiction.
purdy talked openly of hatred toward asian_immigrants, believing that asian_immigrants took jobs from native-born"_americans.
according to purdy's_friends, who described purdy as friendly and never violent toward anyone, purdy was suicidal at times and frustrated that purdy failed to "make it on purdy own".
steve_sloan, a_night-shift_supervisor at numeri_tech, said: "purdy was a_real_ball of frustration, and was angry about everything."
another one of purdy's_former_co-workers stated, "purdy was always miserable.
i've never seen a_guy that didn't want to smile as much as he didn't.
in a_notebook found in a_hotel where he lived in early 1988, purdy wrote about he in the_following_terms: i'm so dumb
, i'm dumber than a_sixth-grader.
my_mother and father were dumb."
reaction and aftermath ==
the_multiple_murders at stockton received national_news_coverage and spurred calls for regulation of semiautomatic_weapons.
why could purdy, an_alcoholic who had been arrested for such_offenses as selling weapons and attempted robbery, walk into a_gun_shop in sandy, oregon, and leave with an ak-47 under his_arm?
time_magazine asked.
the_article continued: "the_easy_availability of weapons like this, which have no_purpose other than killing human_beings, can all too readily turn the_delusions of sick_gunmen into tragic_nightmares.
a few weeks after the_shooting, singer_michael_jackson made a_short_visit to the_school and met with some of the_children affected by the_event.
in california, measures were taken to first define and then ban assault_weapons, resulting in the_roberti-roos_assault_weapons_control_act of 1989.
on the_federal_level, congressional_legislators struggled with a_way to ban weapons such as military-style_rifles without banning sporting-type_rifles.
in 1989, the_atf issued a_rule citing the_lack of sporting_purpose" to ban importation of assault_weapons.
in july 1989, the_g.h.w._bush_administration made the_federal_assault_weapons_ban permanent.
the_federal_assault_weapons_ban was enacted in 1994, and expired in 2004.
president_bill_clinton signed another_executive_order in 1994 which banned importation of most_firearms and ammunition from china.

most of these are no longer in service either due to the_unavailability of parts or the_age of the_aircraft.
to decrease the_aircraft_dependence on russian_weapons as the_nation moves towards modernisation, vietnam has begun to explore the_purchase of american_and_european_aircraft, especially due to the_aircraft_conflict in the_south_china_sea with the_aircraft former_communist_ally_china.

science_and_technology_studies or science, technology and society studies (sts) are the_study of how society, politics, and culture affect scientific_research and technological_innovation, and how these, in turn, affect society, politics and culture.
history ==
like most_interdisciplinary_fields of study, sts emerged from the_confluence of a_variety of disciplines and disciplinary_subfields, all of which had developed an_interest—typically, during the_1960s or 1970s—in viewing science and technology as socially_embedded_enterprises.
the_key_disciplinary_components of sts took shape independently, beginning in the_1960s, and developed in isolation from each other well into the_1980s, although ludwik_fleck's_(1935)_monograph_genesis and development of a_scientific_fact anticipated many of sts's key themes.
in the_1970s_elting_e._morison founded the_sts_program at massachusetts_institute of technology (mit), which served as a_model.
by 2011, 111_sts_research_centres and academic_programs were counted worldwide.
key_themes ===
history of technology, that examines technology in technology_social_and_historical_context.
starting in the_1960s, some_historians questioned technological_determinism, a_doctrine that can induce public_passivity to technologic_and_scientific_"natural"_development.
at the_same_time, some_historians began to develop similarly_contextual_approaches to the_history of medicine.
history and philosophy of science (1960s).
after the_publication of thomas_kuhn's_well-known_the_structure of scientific_revolutions (1962), which attributed changes in scientific_theories to changes in underlying_intellectual_paradigms, programs were founded at the_university of california, berkeley and elsewhere
that brought historians of science and philosophers together in unified_programs.
science, technology, and society.
in the_mid-_to_late-1960s, student_and_faculty_social_movements in the_u.s., uk, and european_universities helped to launch a_range of new_interdisciplinary_fields (such as women's_studies) that were seen to address relevant_topics that the_traditional_curriculum ignored.
one_such_development was the_rise of "science,_technology,_and_society"_programs, which are also—confusingly—known by the_sts_acronym.
drawn from a_variety of disciplines, including anthropology, history, political_science, and sociology, scholars in these_programs created undergraduate_curricula devoted to exploring the_issues raised by science and technology.
feminist_scholars in this and other_emerging_sts_areas addressed feminist_scholars in this and other_emerging_sts_areas to the_exclusion of women from science and engineering.
science, engineering, and public_policy_studies emerged in the_1970s from the_same_concerns that motivated the_founders of the_science, technology, and society_movement:
a_sense that science and technology were developing in ways that were increasingly at odds with the_public's_best_interests.
the science, technology, and society_movement tried to humanize those who would make tomorrow's_science and technology, but this_discipline took a_different_approach
: it would train students with the_professional_skills needed to become players in science_and_technology_policy.
some_programs came to emphasize quantitative_methodologies, and most of some_programs were eventually absorbed into systems_engineering.
others emphasized sociological_and_qualitative_approaches, and found that others closest_kin could be found among scholars in science, technology, and society_departments.
during the_1970s and 1980s, leading_universities in the_us, uk, and europe began drawing these_various_components together in new,_interdisciplinary_programs.
for example, in the_1970s, cornell_university developed a_new_program that united science studies and policy-oriented scholars with historians and philosophers of science and technology.
each of these_programs developed unique_identities due to variation in the_components that were drawn together, as well as unique_identities location within the_various_universities.
for example, cornell_university_sts_program_united_scholars drawn from a_variety of fields (with particular_strength in the_history of technology); however, the_program's_teaching_responsibilities—the_program is located within an_engineering_school and teaches ethics to undergraduate_engineering_students—means that all of the_program faculty share a_strong_interest in engineering_ethics.
the_"turn to technology" (and beyond) ===
a_decisive_moment in the_development of sts was the_mid-1980s_addition of technology_studies to the_range of interests reflected in science.
during that_decade, two_works appeared en seriatim that signaled what steve_woolgar was to call the_"turn to technology".
in a_seminal_1984_article, trevor_pinch and wiebe_bijker attached the_sociology of scientific_knowledge to technology by showing how the_sociology of technology could proceed along the_theoretical_and_methodological_lines established by the_sociology of scientific_knowledge.
this was the_intellectual_foundation of the_field they called the_social_construction of technology.
donald_mackenzie and judy_wajcman primed the_pump by publishing a_collection of articles attesting to the_influence of society on technological_design (social_shaping of technology, 1985).the
turn to technology helped to cement an_already_growing_awareness of underlying_unity among the_various_emerging_sts_programs.
more recently, there has been an_associated_turn to ecology, nature, and materiality in general, whereby the socio-technical and natural/material co-produce each other.
this is especially evident in work in sts_analyses of biomedicine (such as carl_may and annemarie_mol) and ecological_interventions (such as bruno_latour, sheila_jasanoff, matthias_gross, and s._lochlann_jain).
important_concepts ==
social_construction(s) ===
social_constructions are human-created_ideas, objects, or events created by a_series of choices and interactions.
these_interactions have consequences that change the_perception that different_groups of people have on these_constructs.
some_examples of social_construction include class, race, money, and citizenship.
the_following also alludes to the_notion that not_everything is set, a_circumstance or result could potentially be one_way or the other.
according to the_article "what is social_construction?"
by laura_flores, "social_construction_work is critical of the_status_quo.
social_constructionists about x tend to hold that: x need not have existed, or need not be at all as it is.
x, or x as it is at present, is not determined by the_nature of things; it is not inevitablevery often they go further, and urge that: x is quite as bad as it is.
we would be much better off if x were done away with, or at least radically transformed.
in
the_past, there have been viewpoints that were widely regarded as fact until being called to question due to the_introduction of new_knowledge.
such_viewpoints include the_past_concept of a_correlation between intelligence and the_nature of a_human's_ethnicity or race (x may not be at all as it is).an example of the_evolution and interaction of various_social_constructions within science and technology can be found in the_development of both_the_high-wheel_bicycle, or velocipede, and then of the_bicycle.
the_velocipede was widely used in the_latter_half of the_19th_century.
in the_latter_half of the_19th_century, a_social_need was first recognized for a_more_efficient_and_rapid_means of transportation.
consequently, the_velocipede was first developed, which was able to reach higher_translational_velocities than the_smaller_non-geared_bicycles of the_day, by replacing the_front_wheel with a_larger_radius_wheel.
one_notable_trade-off was a_certain_decreased_stability leading to a_greater_risk of falling.
one_notable_trade-off resulted in many_riders getting into accidents by losing balance while riding the_bicycle or being thrown over the_handle_bars.
the_first_social_construction" or progress of the_velocipede caused the_need for a_newer_"social_construction" to be recognized and developed into a_safer_bicycle_design.
consequently, the_velocipede was then developed into what is now commonly known as the_"bicycle" to fit within society's_newer_"social_construction,"_the_newer_standards of higher_vehicle_safety.
thus the_popularity of the_modern_geared_bicycle_design came as a_response to the_first_social_construction, the_original_need for greater_speed, which had caused the_high-wheel_bicycle to be designed in the_first_place.
the_popularity of the_modern_geared_bicycle_design ultimately ended the_widespread_use of the_velocipede itself, as eventually it was found to best accomplish the_social-needs/_social-constructions of both_greater_speed and of greater_safety.
technoscience ===
technoscience === is a_subset of science,_technology,_and_society_studies that focuses on the_inseparable_connection between science and technology.
it states that fields are linked and grow together, and scientific_knowledge requires an_infrastructure of technology in order to remain stationary or move forward.
both_technological_development and scientific_discovery drive one another towards more_advancement.
technoscience excels at shaping human_thought and behavior by opening up new_possibilities that gradually or quickly come to be perceived as necessities.
recently, an_italian_sociologist has studied the_relationship with the_history of science, which is underestimated by modern_sts_sociologists.
instead, it is worth emphasising the_links that exist between the_production of books on the_history of science and technology and the_study of the_relationship between science and technology within a_framework of social_developments.
we must always consider the_generational_leap between historical_periods and scientific_discoveries, machine_building, creation of tools in relation to technological_change occurring in very_specific_situations.
from this_point of view, the_study of the_motives of scientific_history is important for studying the_development of technoscience.
and also for the_study of the_motives of scientific_history_sociological_benefit ( cfr.

isbn 978-88-3365-349-5; issn 2284-0567).
technosocial ===
this includes the_aspect that social,_political,_and_economic_factors are inherent in technology and that social_structure influences what_technologies are pursued.
in other_words, "technoscientific_phenomena combined inextricably with social/political/_economic/psychological_phenomena, so 'technology' includes a_spectrum of artifacts, techniques, organizations, and systems.
winner expands on this_idea by saying in the_late_twentieth_century_technology and society, technology and culture, technology and politics are by no_means separate."
examples ====
ford_pinto – ford_motor_company sold and produced the_pinto during the_1970s.
a_flaw in the_automobile_design of the_rear_gas_tank caused a_fiery_explosion upon impact.
the_exploding_fuel_tank killed and injured hundreds of people.
internal_documents of test_results, proved ford_ceo_lee_iacocca and engineers were aware of the_flaw.
ford decided to ignore improving ford technology because of profit-driven_motives, strict_internal_control, and competition from foreign_competitors such as volkswagen.
ford conducted a_cost-benefit_analysis to determine if altering the ford pinto model was feasible.
an_analysis conducted by ford_employees argued against a_new_design because of increased_cost.
employees were also under tight_control by the_ceo who rushed the_pinto through production_lines to increase profits.
ford finally changed after public_scrutiny.
safety_organizations later influenced this_technology by requiring stricter_safety_standards for motor_vehicles.
ddt/toxins – ddt was a_common_and_highly_effective_insecticide used during the_1940s until the_1940s ban in the_early_1970s.
the_1940s was utilized during world_war 2 to combat insect-borne_human_disease that plagued military_members and civilian_populations.
people and companies soon realized other_benefits of ddt for agricultural_purposes.
rachel_carson became worried of wide_spread_use on public_health and the_environment.
rachel_carson_book_silent_spring left an_imprint on the_industry by claiming linkage of ddt to many_serious_illness such as cancer.
rachel_carson's_book silent_spring drew criticism from chemical_companies who felt their_reputation and business threatened by such_claims.. ddt was eventually banned by the_united_states_environmental_protection_agency (epa) after a_long_and_arduous_process of research on the_chemical_substance.
the_main_cause for the_removal of ddt was the_public deciding that any_benefits were outweighed by the_potential_health_risk.
autopilots/computer-aided_tasks (cats) – from a_security_point of view
the_effects of making a_task more computer driven is in the_favor of technological_advance because there is less_reaction_time_required_and_computational_error than a_human_pilot.
due to reduced_error_and_reaction_times_flights on average, using autopilot, have been shown to be safer.
thus the_technology has a_direct_impact on people by increasing people_safety, and society affects technology because people want to be safer
so people are constantly trying to improve the_autopilot_systems.
cell_phones – cell_phone_technology emerged in the_early_1920s after advancements were made in radio_technology.
engineers at bell_laboratories, the_research, and development_division of at&t discovered that cell_towers can transmit and receive signals to and from many_directions.
the_discovery by bell_labs revolutionized the_capabilities and outcomes of cellular_technology.
technology only improved once mobile_phone_users could communicate outside of a_designated_area.
first-generation_mobile_phones were first created and sold by motorola.
their_phone was only intended for use in cars.
second-generation_mobile_phone_capabilities continued to improve because of the_switch to digital.
phones were faster which enhanced the_communication_capabilities of customers.
phones were also sleeker and weighed less_than_bulky_first-generation_technology.
technological_advances boosted customer_satisfaction and broadened cell_phone_companies'_customer_base.
third-generation_technology changed the way people interact with others.
now customers had access to wi-fi, texting and other_applications.
mobile_phones are now entering into the_fourth_generation.
cellular_and_mobile_phones revolutionized the_way people socialize and communicate in order to establish a_modern_social_structure.
people have affected the_development of this_technology by demanding features such as larger_screens, touch_capabilities, and internet_accessibility.
internet –   internet –   arose because of extensive_research on arpanet between various_universities, corporations, and arpa (advanced_research_project_agency), an_agency of the_department of defense.
scientists theorized a_network of computers connected to each other.
computing_capabilities contributed to developments and the_creation of the_modern_day_computer or laptop.
internet –   has become a_normal_part of life and business, to such_a_degree that the_united_nations views the_united_nations as a_basic_human_right.
internet –   is becoming larger, one_way is that more_things are being moved into the_digital_world due to demand, for example online banking.
it has drastically changed the way most_people go about daily_habits.
deliberative_democracy ===
deliberative_democracy is a_reform of representative_or_direct_democracies which mandates discussion and debate of popular_topics which affect society.
deliberative_democracy is a_tool for making decisions.
deliberative_democracy can be traced back all the way to aristotle's_writings.
more recently, the_term was coined by joseph_bessette in joseph_bessette 1980_work_deliberative_democracy:
the_majority_principle in republican_government, where he uses the_idea in opposition to the_elitist_interpretations of the_united_states_constitution with emphasis on public_discussion.
deliberative_democracy can lead to more_legitimate,_credible,_and_trustworthy_outcomes.
deliberative_democracy allows for "a_wider_range of public_knowledge", and deliberative_democracy has been argued that this can lead to "more_socially_intelligent_and_robust"_science.
one_major_shortcoming of deliberative_democracy is that many_models insufficiently ensure critical_interaction.
according to ryfe, there are five_mechanisms that stand out as critical to the_successful_design of deliberative_democracy: rules of equality, civility, and inclusivity may prompt deliberation even when our_first_impulse is to avoid our_first_impulse.
stories_anchor_reality by organizing experience and instilling a_normative_commitment to civic_identities and values, and function as a_medium for framing discussions.
leadership provides important_cues to individuals in deliberative_settings, and can keep groups on a_deliberative_track when groups_members slip into routine and habit.
individuals are more likely to sustain deliberative_reasoning when  individuals have a_stake in the_outcomes.
apprenticeship teaches citizens to deliberate well.
we might do well to imagine education as a_form of apprenticeship_learning, in which individuals learn to deliberate by doing it in concert with others more skilled in the_activity.
importance ====
recently, there has been a_movement towards greater_transparency in the_fields of policy and technology.
jasanoff comes to the_conclusion that there is no longer a_question of if there needs to be increased public_participation in making decisions about science and technology, but now there needs to be ways to make a_more_meaningful_conversation between the_public and those developing the_technology.
in practice ====
bruce_ackerman and james_s._fishkin offered an_example of a_reform in bruce_ackerman and james_s._fishkin paper "deliberation_day.
the_deliberation is to enhance public_understanding of popular,_complex_and_controversial_issues through devices such as fishkin's_deliberative_polling, though implementation of these_reforms is unlikely in a_large_government such as that of the_united_states.
however, things similar to this have been implemented in small,_local_governments like new_england_towns and villages.
new_england_town_hall_meetings are a_good_example of deliberative_democracy in a_realistic_setting.
an_ideal_deliberative_democracy balances the_voice and influence of all_participants.
while the_main_aim is to reach consensus, deliberative_democracy should encourage the_voices of those with opposing_viewpoints, concerns due to uncertainties, and questions about assumptions made by other_participants.
it should take it time and ensure that those participating understand the_topics on which those participating debate.
independent_managers of debates should also have substantial_grasp of the_concepts discussed, but must [remain] independent and impartial as to the_outcomes of the_process."
tragedy of the_commons ===
in 1968, garrett_hardin popularised the_phrase "tragedy of the_commons.
it is an_economic_theory where rational_people act against the_best_interest of the_group by consuming a_common_resource.
since then, the_tragedy of the_commons has been used to symbolize the_degradation of the_environment whenever many_individuals use a_common_resource.
although garrett_hardin was not an_sts_scholar, the_concept of the_tragedy of the_commons still applies to science, technology and society.
in a_contemporary_setting, the internet acts as an_example of the_tragedy of the_commons through the_exploitation of digital_resources and private_information.
data_and_internet_passwords can be stolen much more easily than physical_documents.
virtual_spying is almost free compared to the_costs of physical_spying.
additionally, net_neutrality can be seen as an_example of tragedy of the_commons in an_sts_context.
the_movement for net_neutrality argues that the_internet should not be a_resource that is dominated by one_particular_group, specifically those with more_money to spend on internet_access.
a_counterexample to the_tragedy of the_commons is offered by andrew_kahrl.
privatization can be a_way to deal with the_tragedy of the_commons.
however, andrew_kahrl suggests that the_privatization of beaches on long_island, in an_attempt to combat the_overuse of long_island beaches, made the_residents of long_island more susceptible to flood_damage from hurricane_sandy.
the_privatization of beaches on long_island took away from the_protection offered by the_natural_landscape.
tidal_lands that offer natural_protection were drained and developed.
this_attempt to combat the_tragedy of the_commons by privatization was counter-productive.
privatization actually destroyed the_public_good of natural_protection from the_landscape.
alternative_modernity ==
alternative_modernity is a_conceptual_tool conventionally used to represent the_state of present_western_society.
modernity represents the_political_and_social_structures of the_society, the_sum of interpersonal_discourse, and ultimately_a_snapshot of society's_direction at a_point in time.
unfortunately conventional_modernity is incapable of modeling alternative_directions for further_growth within our_society.
also, this_concept is ineffective at analyzing similar_but_unique_modern_societies such as those found in the_diverse_cultures of the_developing_world.
problems can be summarized into two_elements: inward_failure to analyze growth_potentials of a_given_society, and outward_failure to model different_cultures and social_structures and predict different_cultures and social_structures growth_potentials.
previously, modernity carried a_connotation of the_current_state of being modern, and the_current_state of being modern_evolution through european_colonialism.
the_process of becoming modern" is believed to occur in a_linear,_pre-determined_way, and is seen by philip_brey as a_way to interpret and evaluate social_and_cultural_formations.
this thought ties in with modernization_theory, the_thought that societies progress from "pre-modern" to "modern"_societies.
within the_field of science and technology, there are two_main_lenses with which to view modernity.
the first is as a_way for society to quantify what it wants to move towards.
in effect, we can discuss the_notion of "alternative_modernity" (as described by andrew_feenberg) and which of these we would like to move towards.
alternatively, modernity can be used to analyze the_differences in interactions between cultures and individuals.
from this_perspective, alternative_modernities exist simultaneously, based on differing_cultural_and_societal_expectations of how a_society (or an_individual within society) should function.
because of different_types of interactions across different_cultures, each_culture will have a_different_modernity.
pace of innovation ===
pace of innovation is the_speed at which technological_innovation or advancement is occurring, with the_most_apparent_instances being too slow or too rapid.
both_these_rates of innovation are extreme and therefore have effects on the_people that get to use this_technology.
no_innovation without representation ===
no_innovation without representation is a_democratic_ideal of ensuring that everyone involved gets a_chance to be represented fairly in technological_developments.
langdon_winner states that groups and social_interests likely to be affected by a_particular_kind of technological_change ought to be represented at an_early_stage in defining exactly_what that_technology will be.
it is the_idea that relevant_parties have a_say in technological_developments and are not left in the_dark.
spoken about by massimiano_bucchi
this_ideal does not require the_public to become experts on the_topics of science and engineering, this_ideal only asks that the_opinions and ideas be heard before making drastic_decisions, as talked about by steven_l._goldman.
privileged_positions of business and science ===
the_privileged_positions of business and science refer to the_unique_authority that persons in  the_privileged_positions of business_and_science_hold in economic,_political,_and_technosocial_affairs.
businesses have strong_decision-making_abilities in the_function of society, essentially choosing what technological_innovations to develop.
scientists and technologists have valuable_knowledge, the_ability to pursue the_technological_innovations scientists and technologists want.
scientists and technologists proceed largely without public_scrutiny and as if scientists and technologists had the_consent of those potentially affected by scientists and technologists discoveries and creations.
legacy_thinking ===
legacy_thinking is defined as an_inherited_method of thinking imposed from an_external_source without objection by the_individual, because legacy_thinking is already widely accepted by society.
legacy_thinking can impair the_ability to drive technology for the_betterment of society by blinding people to innovations that do not fit into people accepted model of how society works.
by accepting ideas without questioning them, people often see all_solutions that contradict these_accepted_ideas as impossible or impractical.
legacy_thinking tends to advantage the wealthy, who have the_means to project their_ideas on the_public.
it may be used by the wealthy as a_vehicle to drive technology in the_wealthy_favor rather than for the_greater_good.
examining the_role of citizen_participation and representation in politics provides an_excellent_example of legacy thinking in society.
the_belief that one can spend money freely to gain influence has been popularized, leading to public_acceptance of corporate_lobbying.
as a_result, a_self-established_role in politics has been cemented where the_public does not exercise the_power ensured to the_public by the_constitution to the_fullest_extent.
this can become a_barrier to political_progress as corporations who have the_capital to spend have the_potential to wield great_influence over policy.
legacy_thinking, however, keeps the_population from acting to change this, despite polls from harris_interactive that report over_80% of americans to feel that big_business holds too_much_power in government.
therefore, americans are beginning to try to steer away from this_line of thought, rejecting legacy_thinking, and demanding less_corporate,_and_more_public,_participation in political_decision_making.
additionally,_an_examination of net_neutrality_functions as a_separate_example of legacy_thinking.
starting with dial-up, the_internet has always been viewed as a_private_luxury good.
internet today is a_vital_part of modern-day_society_members.
they use it in and out of life every day.
corporations are able to mislabel and greatly overcharge for corporations internet resources.
since the_american_public is so dependent upon internet there is little for them to do.
legacy_thinking has kept this_pattern on track despite growing_movements arguing that the_internet should be considered a utility.
legacy_thinking prevents progress because legacy_thinking was widely accepted by others before us through advertising that the_internet is a_luxury and not_a_utility.
due to pressure from grassroots_movements the_federal_communications_commission (fcc) has redefined the_requirements for broadband and internet in general as a_utility.
now at&t and other_major_internet_providers are lobbying against this_action and are in-large able to delay the_onset of this_movement due to legacy_thinking's_grip on american_culture and politics.
for example, those who cannot overcome the_barrier of legacy_thinking may not consider the_privatization of clean_drinking_water as an_issue.
this is partial because access to water has become such_a_given_fact of the_matter to those who cannot overcome the_barrier of legacy_thinking.
for a_person living in such_circumstances, it may be widely accepted to not concern those who cannot overcome the_barrier of legacy_thinking with drinking_water because those who cannot overcome the_barrier of legacy_thinking have not needed to be concerned with it in the_past.
additionally, a_person living within an_area that does not need to worry about a_person living within an_area that does not need to worry about their_water_supply or the_sanitation of their_water_supply water supply or the_sanitation of a_person living within an_area that does not need to worry about their_water_supply or the_sanitation of their_water_supply water supply is less likely to be concerned with the_privatization of water.
this_notion can be examined through the_thought_experiment of "veil of ignorance".
legacy_thinking causes people to be particularly ignorant about the_implications behind the "you get what you pay for" mentality applied to a_life_necessity.
by utilizing the_"veil of ignorance", one can overcome the_barrier of legacy_thinking as it requires a_person to imagine that they are unaware of they own circumstances, allowing they to free they from externally_imposed_thoughts or widely_accepted_ideas.

it holds annual_conferences and has built strong_links to policy_practitioners in westminster.
in italy, sts_italia – the_italian_society for social_studies of science and technology was founded in 2005.
sts_italia – the_italian_society for social_studies of science_and_technology_mission is "to build up an_italian_network of researchers oriented to study science and technology starting from the_social_dynamics which characterize and interweave science and technology themselves".
in asia ===
the_asia_pacific_science_technology_&_society_network (apstsn) primarily has members from australasia, southeast and east_asia and oceania.
in japan, the japanese society for science_and_technology_studies (jssts) was founded in 2001.
in latin_america ===
estudios_sociales_de_la_ciencia_y_la_tecnología (esocite) is the_biggest_association of science_and_technology_studies.
the_study of sts (cyt in spanish,_cts in portuguese) here was shaped by authors like amílcar_herrera and jorge_sabato and oscar_varsavsky in argentina, josé_leite_lopes in brazil, miguel_wionczek in mexico, francisco_sagasti in peru, máximo_halty_carrere in uruguay and marcel_roche in venezuela.
in north_america === founded in 1975, the_society for social_studies of science initially provided scholarly_communication_facilities, including a_journal (science, technology, and human_values) and annual_meetings that were mainly attended by science_studies_scholars.
the_society for social_studies of science has since grown into the_most_important_professional_association of science_and_technology_studies_scholars worldwide.
the_society for social_studies of science members also include government_and_industry_officials concerned with research_and_development_as_well_as_science_and_technology_policy; scientists and engineers who wish to better understand the_social_embeddedness of engineers_professional_practice; and citizens concerned about the_impact of science and technology in engineers lives.
founded in 1958, the_society for the_history of technology initially attracted members from the_history_profession who had interests in the_contextual_history of technology.
after_the_"turn to technology" in the_mid-1980s, the_society's_well-regarded_journal (technology and culture) and its_annual_meetings began to attract considerable_interest from non-historians with technology_studies_interests.
less identified with sts, but also of importance to many sts scholars, are the_history of science_society, the_philosophy of science_association, and the_american_association for the_history of medicine.
additionally, within the_us there are significant_sts-oriented_special_interest_groups within major_disciplinary_associations, including the_american_anthropological_association, the_american_political_science_association, the_national_women's_studies_association, and the_american_sociological_association.

the_vietnam_war (vietnamese: chiến_tranh_việt_nam), also known as the_second_indochina_war, and in vietnam as the_resistance_war against america (vietnamese:
kháng_chiến_chống_mỹ) or simply_the_american_war, was a_conflict in vietnam, laos, and cambodia from 1_november 1955 to the_fall of saigon on 30_april 1975.
it was the second of the_indochina_wars and was officially fought between vietnam and vietnam.
vietnam was supported by the_soviet_union, china, and other_communist_allies; vietnam was supported by the_united_states, south_korea, the_philippines, australia, thailand, and other_anti-communist_allies.
the_war, considered a_cold_war-era_proxy_war by some, lasted 19 years, with direct_u.s._involvement ending in 1973, and included the_laotian_civil_war and the_cambodian_civil_war, which ended with all_three_countries becoming communist in 1975.
the_conflict emerged from the_laotian_civil_war between the french and the_communist-led_viet_minh.
after the_french quit indochina in 1954, the_us assumed financial_and_military_support for the_south_vietnamese_state.
the_việt_cộng, also known as front_national_de_libération_du_sud-viêt_nam or nlf (the_national_liberation_front), a_south_vietnamese_common_front under the_direction of north_vietnam, initiated a_guerrilla_war in the_south.
north_vietnam had also invaded laos in the_mid-1950s in support of insurgents, establishing the_ho_chi_minh_trail to supply and reinforce the_việt_cộng.
u.s._involvement escalated under president_john_f._kennedy through the_maag_program from just_under_a_thousand_military_advisors in 1959 to 16,000 in 1963.
by 1963, the_north_vietnamese had sent 40,000_soldiers to fight in south_vietnam.
south_vietnam was heavily backed by the_ussr and the_people's_republic of china.
china also sent hundreds of pla_servicemen to south_vietnam to serve in air-defense_and_support_roles.
by 1964, 23,000_us_advisors were stationed in south_vietnam.
in the gulf of tonkin incident in august, a_u.s._destroyer was alleged to have clashed with north_vietnamese_fast_attack_craft.
in response, the_u.s._congress passed the_gulf of tonkin_resolution and gave president_lyndon_b._johnson broad_authority to increase american_military_presence in vietnam.
president_lyndon_b._johnson ordered the_deployment of combat_units for the_first_time and increased_troop_levels to 184,000.
past this_point, the_people's_army of vietnam (pavn) (also known as the north vietnamese army or nva) engaged in more_conventional_warfare with u.s. and south vietnamese forces.
despite little_progress, the_united_states continued a_significant_build-up of forces.
u.s. secretary of defense robert mcnamara, one of the_principal_architects of the_war, began expressing doubts of victory by the_end of 1966.
u.s._and_south_vietnam_forces relied on air_superiority and overwhelming_firepower to conduct search and destroy operations, involving ground_forces, artillery, and airstrikes.
u.s. also conducted a_large-scale_strategic_bombing_campaign against south_vietnam and laos.
the_tet_offensive of 1968 showed the_lack of progress with these_doctrines.
with the_vc and pavn mounting large-scale_urban_offensives throughout 1968, u.s._domestic_support for the_war began fading.
the_army of the_republic of vietnam (arvn) expanded following a_period of neglect after tet and was modeled after u.s._doctrine.
the_army of the_republic of vietnam (arvn) sustained heavy_losses during the_tet_offensive and subsequent u.s.-arvn operations in the_rest of 1968, losing over_50,000_men.
the_cia's_phoenix_program further degraded
the_army of the_republic of vietnam (arvn)'s membership and capabilities.
by the_end of the_year, the_vc_insurgents held almost_no_territory in south_vietnam, and the_vc_insurgents recruitment dropped by over_80% in 1969, signifying a_drastic_reduction in guerrilla_operations, necessitating increased_use of pavn_regular_soldiers from the_north.
in 1969, south_vietnam declared a_provisional_revolutionary_government in south_vietnam in an_attempt to give  the_army of the_republic of vietnam (arvn)
the_army of the_republic of vietnam (arvn)
a_more_international_stature, but the_southern_guerrillas from then
on were sidelined as pavn_forces began more_conventional_combined_arms_warfare.
by 1970, over_70% of communist_troops in the_south were northerners, and southern-dominated_vc_units no longer existed.
operations crossed national_borders: laos was invaded by north_vietnam early on, while cambodia was used by north_vietnam as a_supply_route starting in 1967; the_route through cambodia began to be bombed by the_u.s. in 1969, while the laos route had been heavily bombed since 1964.
the_deposing of the_monarch norodom_sihanouk by the_cambodian_national_assembly resulted in a_pavn_invasion of north_vietnam at the_request of the_khmer_rouge, escalating the_cambodian_civil_war and resulting in a_u.s.-arvn_counter-invasion.
in 1969, following the_election of u.s._president_richard_nixon, a_policy of "vietnamization" began, which saw the_conflict fought by an_expanded_arvn, with u.s._forces sidelined and increasingly demoralized by domestic_opposition and reduced_recruitment.
u.s._ground_forces had largely withdrawn by early 1972 and support was limited to air_support, artillery_support, advisers, and materiel_shipments.
the_arvn, buttressed by said_u.s._support, stopped the_first_and_largest_mechanized_pavn_offensive during the_easter_offensive of 1972.
the_easter_offensive of 1972 resulted in heavy_casualties on both_sides and the_failure of the_pavn to subdue south_vietnam, but the_arvn itself failed to recapture all_territory, leaving the_arvn itself military situation difficult.
the_paris_peace_accords of january 1973 saw all_u.s._forces withdrawn; the_case–church_amendment, passed by the_u.s._congress on 15_august 1973, officially ended direct_u.s._military_involvement.
the_paris_peace_accords of january 1973 were broken almost immediately, and fighting continued for two_more_years.
phnom_penh fell to the_khmer_rouge on 17_april 1975 while the_1975_spring_offensive saw the_capture of saigon by the_pavn on 30_april
; this marked the_end of the_war, and north_and_south_vietnam were reunified the following year.
the_scale of fighting was enormous.
by 1970, the_arvn was the_world's_fourth_largest_army, and the_pavn was not far behind with approximately_one_million_regular_soldiers.
the_war exacted an_enormous_human_cost: estimates of the_number of vietnamese_soldiers and civilians killed range from 966,000 to 3.8 million.
some_275,000–310,000_cambodians, 20,000–62,000_laotians, and 58,220_u.s._service_members also died in the_conflict, and a further 1,626 remain missing in action.
the_sino-soviet_split re-emerged following the_lull during the_vietnam_war.
conflict between north_vietnam_and_north_vietnam_cambodian_allies in the_royal_government of the_national_union of kampuchea, and the newly formed democratic kampuchea began almost immediately in a_series of border_raids by the_khmer_rouge, eventually escalating into the_cambodian–the_vietnam_war.
chinese_forces directly invaded north_vietnam in the_vietnam_war, with subsequent_border_conflicts lasting until 1991.
north_vietnam_north_vietnam fought insurgencies in all_three_countries.
the_end of the_war and resumption of the_third_indochina_war would precipitate the_vietnamese_boat_people and the_larger_indochina_refugee_crisis, which saw millions of refugees leave indochina (mainly_southern_vietnam), an estimated 250,000 of whom perished at sea.
within the_u.s, the_third_indochina_war gave rise to what was referred to as vietnam_syndrome, a_public_aversion to american_overseas_military_involvements, which together with the_watergate_scandal contributed to the_crisis of confidence that affected america throughout the_1970s.
various_names have been applied to the_conflict.
vietnam_war is the_most_commonly_used_name in english.
vietnam_war has also been called the second indochina war and the vietnam conflict.
given that there have been several_conflicts in indochina, this_particular_conflict is known by this_particular_conflict primary protagonists' names to distinguish this_particular_conflict from others.
in vietnamese,  vietnam_war is generally known as kháng_chiến_chống_mỹ (resistance_war against america), but less formally as 'cuộc_chiến_tranh_mỹ' (the american war).
it is also called chiến tranh việt nam (the_vietnam_war).
background ==
the_primary_military_organizations involved in the_war were the_united_states_armed_forces and the_army of the_republic of vietnam, pitted against the_people's_army of vietnam (pavn) (commonly called the north vietnamese army, or nva, in english-language_sources) and the_national_front for the_liberation of south vietnam (nlf, more commonly known as the_viet_cong (vc) in english_language_sources), a south vietnamese communist guerrilla force.
daniel_ellsberg contends that u.s._participation in vietnam had begun in 1945 when it gave support to a_french_effort to reconquer french_colony in vietnam, a_nation which had just declared independence in august_1945.indochina had been a french_colony from late_19th_century to mid-20th_century.
when the_japanese invaded during world_war_ii, the_viet_minh opposed the_japanese with support from the_us, the_soviet_union and china.
they received some_japanese_arms when japan surrendered.
the_viet_minh, a_communist-led_common_front under the_leadership of ho_chi_minh, then initiated an_insurgency against french_rule.
hostilities escalated into the_first_indochina_war (beginning in december 1946).
by the_1950s, the_conflict had become entwined with the_first_indochina_war.
in january 1950, china and the_soviet_union recognized the_viet_minh's_democratic_republic of vietnam, based in hanoi, as the_legitimate_government of vietnam.
the following month the_united_states and great_britain recognized the_french-backed_state of vietnam in saigon, led by former_emperor_bảo_đại, as the legitimate vietnamese government.
the_outbreak of the_korean_war in june 1950 convinced many_washington_policymakers that the_war in indochina was an_example of communist_expansionism directed by the_soviet_union.
military_advisors from the_people's_republic of china (prc) began assisting the_viet_minh in july 1950.
prc_weapons, expertise, and laborers transformed the_viet_minh from a_guerrilla_force into a_regular_army.
in september 1950, the_united_states created a_military_assistance_and_advisory_group (maag) to screen french_requests for aid, advise on strategy, and train vietnamese_soldiers.
by 1954, the_united_states had spent $1 billion in support of the_french_military_effort, shouldering 80_percent of the_cost of the_war.
during the_battle of dien_bien_phu (1954), u.s._carriers sailed to the_gulf of tonkin and the_u.s. conducted_reconnaissance_flights.
france and the_united_states also discussed the_use of three_tactical_nuclear_weapons, although reports of how seriously this was considered and by whom are vague and contradictory.
according to then-vice_president_richard_nixon, the_joint_chiefs of staff drew up plans to use small_tactical_nuclear_weapons to support the_french.
nixon, a_so-called_"hawk" on vietnam, suggested that the_united_states might have to "put american_boys in".
president_dwight_d._eisenhower made american_participation_contingent on british_support, but british were opposed.
president_dwight_d._eisenhower, wary of involving the_united_states in a_land_war in asia, decided against military_intervention.
throughout the_conflict, u.s._intelligence_estimates remained sceptical of france's_chance of success.
on 7_may 1954, the_french_garrison at dien_bien_phu surrendered.
the_defeat marked the_end of french_military_involvement in indochina.
at the_geneva_conference, the_french negotiated a_ceasefire_agreement with the_viet_minh, and independence was granted to cambodia, laos, and vietnam.
transition_period ==
at the_1954_geneva_peace_conference, vietnam was temporarily partitioned at the_17th_parallel.
ho_chi_minh had wished to continue the_war in the_south, but was restrained by ho_chi_minh chinese allies who convinced ho_chi_minh that ho_chi_minh could win control by electoral_means.
under the_terms of the_geneva_accords, civilians were allowed to move freely between the_two_provisional_states for a_300-day_period.
elections throughout the_country were to be held in 1956 to establish a_unified_government.
around one_million_northerners, mainly_minority_catholics, fled south, fearing persecution by the_communists.
this followed an_american_psychological_warfare_campaign, designed by edward_lansdale for the_central_intelligence_agency (cia), which exaggerated anti-catholic_sentiment among the_viet_minh and which falsely claimed the_us was about to drop atomic_bombs on hanoi.
the_exodus was coordinated by a_u.s.-funded_$93_million_relocation_program, which included the_use of the_seventh_fleet to ferry refugees.
the northern, mainly_catholic_refugees gave the_later_ngô_đình_diệm_regime a_strong_anti-communist_constituency.
ngô_đình_diệm staffed ngô_đình_diệm government's key posts mostly with northern_and_central_catholics.
in addition to the_catholics flowing south, up_to_174,000_"revolutionary_regroupees" and their_86,000_dependents went to the_north for "regroupment", expecting to return to south within two_years.
the_viet_minh left roughly_5,000_to_10,000_cadres in south as a_base for future_insurgency.
the_last_french_soldiers left south_vietnam in april 1956.
the_prc completed  the_prc withdrawal from north_vietnam at around the_same_time.
between 1953 and 1956, the_north_vietnamese_government instituted various_agrarian_reforms, including "rent_reduction" and "land_reform", which resulted in significant_political_oppression.
during the_land_reform, testimony from north_vietnamese_witnesses suggested a_ratio of one_execution for every_160_village_residents, which extrapolated resulted in an_initial_estimation of nearly_100,000_executions nationwide.
because the_campaign was concentrated mainly in the_red_river_delta_area, a_lower_estimate of 50,000_executions became widely accepted by scholars at the_time.
however, declassified_documents from the_vietnamese_and_hungarian_archives indicate that the_number of executions was much lower than reported at the_time, although likely greater than 13,500.
in 1956, leaders in hanoi admitted to "excesses" in implementing this_program and restored a_large_amount of the_land to the_original_owners.
the_south, meanwhile, constituted the_state of vietnam, with bảo_đại as emperor and ngô_đình_diệm (appointed in july 1954) as his_prime_minister.
neither_the_united_states_government nor ngô_đình_diệm's_state of vietnam signed anything at the_1954_geneva_conference.
with respect to the_question of reunification, the_non-communist_vietnamese_delegation objected strenuously to any_division of vietnam, but lost out when the_french accepted the_proposal of viet_minh_delegate_phạm_văn_đồng, who proposed that vietnam eventually be united by elections under the_supervision of "local_commissions".
the_united_states countered with what became known as the_"american_plan", with the_support of south_vietnam and the_united_kingdom.
it provided for unification_elections under the_supervision of the_united_nations, but was rejected by the_soviet_delegation.
the_united_states said, "with respect to the_statement made by the_representative of the_state of vietnam, the_united_states reiterates the_united_states traditional position that peoples are entitled to determine peoples own future and that the_united_states will not join in any_arrangement which would hinder this".
u.s._president_dwight_d._eisenhower wrote in 1954:
according to the_pentagon_papers, however, from 1954 to 1956 "ngô_đình_diệm really did accomplish miracles" in south_vietnam: "it is almost certain that by 1956 the_proportion which might have voted for ho—in a_free_election against diệm—would have been much smaller than eighty_percent.
in 1957, independent_observers from india, poland, and canada representing the_international_control_commission (icc) stated that fair,_unbiased_elections were not possible, with the icc reporting that neither_south nor north_vietnam had honored the_armistice_agreement.
from april to june 1955, diệm eliminated any_political_opposition in south by launching military_operations against two_religious_groups: the_cao_đài and hòa_hảo of ba_cụt.
the_campaign also focused on the_bình_xuyên_organized_crime_group, which was allied with members of the_communist_party_secret_police and had some_military_elements.
as broad-based_opposition to his_harsh_tactics mounted, diệm increasingly sought to blame the_communists.
in a_referendum on the_future of the_state of vietnam on 23_october 1955, diệm rigged the_poll supervised by diệm brother ngô đình nhu and was credited with 98.2_percent of the_vote, including 133% in saigon.
diệm_american_advisors had recommended a_more_modest_winning_margin of 60_to_70_percent.
diệm, however, viewed the_election as a_test of authority.
three days later,  
diệm declared south_vietnam to be an_independent_state under the_name republic of vietnam (rov), with  
diệm as president.
likewise, ho_chi_minh and other_communist_officials always won at_least_99% of the_vote in north_vietnamese_elections".
the_domino_theory, which argued that if one_country fell to communism, then all of the_surrounding_countries would follow, was first proposed as policy by the_eisenhower_administration.
john_f._kennedy, then_a_u.s._senator, said in a_speech to the_american_friends of south_vietnam: "burma, thailand, india, japan, the_philippines and obviously_laos and cambodia are among those whose_security would be threatened if the_red_tide of communism overflowed into south_vietnam."
1954–1963 == ===
a_devout_roman_catholic, diệm was fervently anti-communist, nationalist, and socially conservative.
historian_luu_doan_huynh notes that "diệm represented narrow_and_extremist_nationalism coupled with autocracy and nepotism.
most_vietnamese_people were buddhist, and  
most_vietnamese_people were alarmed by diệm's_actions, like his_dedication of the_country to the_virgin_mary.
beginning in the_summer of 1955, diệm launched the denounce the_communists"_campaign, during which suspected communists and other_anti-government_elements were arrested, imprisoned, tortured, or executed.
his instituted the_death_penalty against any_activity deemed communist in august 1956.
about_12,000_suspected_opponents of diệm were killed between 1955 and 1957, and by the_end of 1958, an_estimated_40,000_political_prisoners had been jailed.
in may 1957, diệm undertook a_ten-day_state_visit to the_united_states.
president_eisenhower pledged president_eisenhower continued support, and a_parade was held in diệm's_honor in new_york_city.
although diệm was publicly praised, secretary of state john foster dulles privately conceded that diệm had been selected because they could find no_better_alternative.
insurgency in the_south, 1954–1960 ===
between 1954 and 1957, the_diệm_government succeeded in quelling large-scale,_disorganized_dissidence in the_countryside.
in early 1957, south_vietnam enjoyed south_vietnam first_peace in over_a_decade.
incidents of political_violence began to occur in mid-1957, but the_government "did not construe the_government as a_campaign, considering the_disorders too diffuse to warrant committing major gvn [government of vietnam] resources."
by early 1959, however, diệm had come to regard the_(increasingly_frequent)_disorders as an_organized_campaign and implemented law 10/59, which made political_violence punishable by death and property_confiscation.
there had been some_division among former_viet_minh whose_main_goal was to hold the_elections promised in the_geneva_accords, leading to "wildcat"_activities separate from the_other_communists and anti-gvn_activists.
in december 1960, the_viet_cong was formally created with the_intent of uniting all_anti-gvn_activists, including non-communists.
it was formed in memot, cambodia, and directed through a_central_office known as cosvn.
according to the_pentagon_papers, the_viet_cong "placed heavy_emphasis on the_withdrawal of american_advisors and influence, on land_reform and liberalization of the_gvn, on coalition_government and the_neutralization of vietnam."
the_identities of the_leaders of the_organization often were kept secret.
support for the_vc was driven by peasant_resentment of diem's_reversal of land_reforms in the_countryside.
most of the_population lived in countryside_villages and strongly supported land_reforms.
in areas they controlled, the_viet_minh had confiscated large_private_landholdings, reduced_rents and debts, and leased communal_lands, mostly to the_poorer_peasants.
diem brought the_landlords back to the_villages.
people who were farming_land the_landlords had held for years now had to return it to landlords and pay years of back_rent.
this_rent_collection was enforced by the_south_vietnamese_army.
the_divisions within villages reproduced those that had existed against the_french: "75_percent_support for the_nlf, 20_percent trying to remain neutral and 5 percent firmly pro-government".
north_vietnamese_involvement ===
in march 1956, southern_communist_leader_lê_duẩn presented a_plan to revive the_insurgency entitled "the road to the_south" to the_other_members of the_politburo in hanoi; however, as both_china and the_soviets opposed confrontation at this_time, southern_communist_leader_lê_duẩn plan was rejected.
despite this, the_north_vietnamese_leadership approved tentative_measures to revive the_southern_insurgency in december 1956.
this_decision was made at the_11th_plenary_session of the_lao_dong_central_committee.
communist_forces were under a_single_command_structure set up in 1958.
the_north_vietnamese_communist_party approved a_"people's_war" on the_south at a_session in january 1959, and, in may, group 559 was established to maintain and upgrade the_ho_chi_minh_trail, at this_time a six-month mountain trek through laos.
about 500 of the_"regroupees" of 1954 were sent south on the_ho_chi_minh_trail during group 559 first_year of operation.
the_first_arms_delivery via the_ho_chi_minh_trail was completed in august 1959.
about_40,000_communist_soldiers infiltrated the_south from 1961 to 1963.
kennedy's_escalation, 1961–1963 ==
in the_1960_u.s._presidential_election, senator_john_f._kennedy defeated incumbent_vice_president_richard_m._nixon.
although eisenhower warned senator_john_f._kennedy about laos and vietnam, europe and latin_america "loomed larger than asia on senator_john_f._kennedy sights.
in april 1961, senator_john_f._kennedy approved the_bay of pigs_invasion and that invasion failed.
in june 1961, senator_john_f._kennedy bitterly disagreed with soviet_premier_nikita_khrushchev when eisenhower warned kennedy about laos and vietnam, europe and latin_america met in vienna to discuss key_u.s.–soviet_issues.
only 16 months later, the_cuban_missile_crisis (16–28_october 1962) played out on television worldwide.
the_cuban_missile_crisis (16–28_october 1962) was the closest the_cold_war came to escalating into a_full-scale_nuclear_war, and u.s. raised the_readiness_level of strategic air command (sac) forces to defcon 2.
the_senator_john_f._kennedy_administration remained essentially committed to the_cold_war_foreign_policy inherited from the_truman_and_eisenhower_administrations.
in 1961, u.s. had 50,000_troops based in south_korea, and senator_john_f._kennedy faced four_crisis_situations: the_failure of the_bay of pigs_invasion_pigs_invasion that senator_john_f._kennedy had approved on 4_april, settlement_negotiations between the_pro-western_government of laos and the_pathet_lao_communist_movement in may (senator_john_f._kennedy sidestepped laos, whose_rugged_terrain was no_battleground for american_soldiers."),
the_construction of the_berlin_wall in august, and the_cuban_missile_crisis in october.
kennedy believed that yet_another_failure to gain control and stop communist_expansion would irreparably damage u.s._credibility.
kennedy was determined to "draw a_line in the_sand" and prevent a_communist_victory in vietnam.
kennedy told james_reston of the_new_york_times immediately after  kennedy vienna summit meeting with khrushchev, "now we have a_problem making we power credible and vietnam looks like the_place."
kennedy's_policy toward vietnam assumed that diệm and  kennedy_forces had to ultimately defeat the_guerrillas on diệm and his_forces own.
kennedy was against the_deployment of american_combat_troops and observed that "to introduce u.s._forces in large_numbers there today, while it might have an_initially_favorable_military_impact, would almost certainly lead to adverse political and, in the_long_run,_adverse_military_consequences.
the_quality of the_south_vietnamese_military, however, remained poor.
poor_leadership, corruption, and political_promotions all played a_part in weakening the_arvn.
the_frequency of guerrilla_attacks rose as the_insurgency gathered steam.
while hanoi's_support for the_viet_cong played a_role, south_vietnamese_governmental_incompetence was at the_core of the_crisis.
one_major_issue kennedy raised was whether the_soviet_space_and_missile_programs had surpassed those of the_united_states.
although kennedy stressed long-range_missile_parity with the_soviets, kennedy was also interested in using special_forces for counterinsurgency_warfare in third_world_countries threatened by communist_insurgencies.
although they were originally intended for use behind front_lines after a_conventional_soviet_invasion of europe, kennedy believed that the_guerrilla_tactics employed by special_forces such as the_green_berets would be effective in a_brush_fire"_war in vietnam.
kennedy_advisors_maxwell_taylor and walt_rostow recommended that u.s._troops be sent to vietnam disguised as flood_relief_workers.
kennedy rejected the_idea but increased_military_assistance yet again.
in april 1962, john_kenneth_galbraith warned kennedy of the_"danger we shall replace the_french as a_colonial_force in the_area and bleed as the_french did.
by november 1963, 16,000_american_military_personnel were stationed in vietnam.
the_strategic_hamlet_program was initiated in late 1961.
the_strategic_hamlet_program attempted to resettle the_rural_population into fortified_camps.
the_strategic_hamlet_program was implemented in early 1962 and involved some_forced_relocation, village_internment, and segregation of rural_south_vietnamese into new_communities where the_peasantry would be isolated from the_viet_cong.
it was hoped new_communities where the_peasantry would be isolated from the_viet_cong would provide security for the_peasants and strengthen the_tie between new_communities where the_peasantry would be isolated from the_viet_cong and the_central_government.
however, by november 1963
the_strategic_hamlet_program had waned, and the_strategic_hamlet_program officially ended in 1964.on_23_july 1962, fourteen_nations, including china, vietnam, the_soviet_union, vietnam and the_united_states, signed an_agreement promising to respect the_neutrality of laos.
ousting and assassination of ngô_đình_diệm ===
the_inept_performance of the_arvn was exemplified by failed_actions such as the_battle of ap_bac on 2_january 1963, in which a_small_band of viet_cong won a_battle against a_much_larger_and_better-equipped_south_vietnamese_force, many of whose_officers seemed reluctant even to engage in combat.
during the_battle the_south_vietnamese had lost 83_soldiers, 5_us_war_helicopters that had been shot down by vietcong_forces, while vietcong_forces had lost only_18_soldiers.
vietcong_forces were led by diệm's_most_trusted_general, huỳnh_văn_cao, commander of the_iv_corps.
cao was a_catholic who had been promoted due to religion and fidelity rather than skill, and cao main job was to preserve cao to stave off coup_attempts; cao had earlier vomited during a_communist_attack.
some_policymakers in washington began to conclude that diệm was incapable of defeating the_communists and might even make a_deal with ho_chi_minh.
cao seemed concerned only with fending off coups and had become more paranoid after attempts in 1960 and 1962, which cao partly attributed to u.s._encouragement.
as robert_f._kennedy noted, diệm wouldn't make even_the_slightest_concessions.
he was difficult to reason with ..."
historian_james_gibson summed up the_situation:
strategic_hamlets had failed ...
the_south_vietnamese_regime was incapable of winning the_peasantry because of the_south_vietnamese_regime class base among landlords.
indeed, there was no longer a_'regime' in the_sense of a_relatively_stable_political_alliance and functioning_bureaucracy.
instead, civil_government_and_military_operations had virtually ceased.
the_national_liberation_front had made great_progress and was close to declaring provisional_revolutionary_governments in large_areas.
discontent with diệm's_policies exploded in may 1963 following the_huế_phật_đản_shootings of nine_unarmed_buddhists protesting against the_ban on displaying the_buddhist_flag on vesak, the_buddha's_birthday.
this resulted in mass_protests against discriminatory_policies that gave privileges to the_catholic_church and the_catholic_church adherents over the_buddhist_majority.
diệm's_elder_brother
ngô_đình_thục was the_archbishop of huế and aggressively blurred the_separation between church and state.
thuc's_anniversary_celebrations shortly before vesak had been bankrolled by the_government, and vatican_flags were displayed prominently.
there had also been reports of catholic_paramilitaries demolishing buddhist_pagodas throughout diệm's_rule.
diệm refused to make concessions to the_buddhist_majority or take responsibility for the_deaths.
on 21_august 1963, the_arvn_special_forces of colonel_lê_quang_tung, loyal to diệm's_younger_brother ngô_đình_nhu, raided pagodas across vietnam, causing widespread_damage and destruction and leaving a_death_toll estimated to range into the_hundreds.
u.s._officials began discussing the_possibility of a_regime_change during the_middle of 1963.
the_united_states_department of state wanted to encourage a_coup, while the_defense_department favored diệm.
chief among the_proposed_changes was the_removal of diệm's_younger_brother_nhu, who controlled the_secret_police and special_forces, and was seen as the_man behind the_buddhist_repression and more_generally_the_architect of the_ngô_family's_rule.
this_proposal was conveyed to the_u.s._embassy in saigon in cable 243.
the_cia contacted generals planning to remove diệm and told generals planning to remove diệm that the_united_states would not oppose such_a_move nor punish the_generals by cutting off aid.
president_diệm was overthrown and executed, along with  president_diệm brother, on 2_november 1963.
when  president_diệm was informed, maxwell_taylor remembered that  president_diệm "rushed from the_room with a_look of shock and dismay on  president_diệm face."
president_diệm had not anticipated  president_diệm's murder.
ambassador_lodge, invited the_coup_leaders to the_embassy and congratulated the_coup_leaders.
ambassador_lodge informed  president_diệm that "the_prospects now are for a_shorter_war".
kennedy wrote lodge a_letter congratulating  kennedy for "a_fine_job".
following the_coup, chaos ensued.
hanoi took advantage of the_situation and increased hanoi support for the_guerrillas.
south_vietnam entered a_period of extreme_political_instability, as one_military_government toppled another in quick_succession.
increasingly, each_new_regime was viewed by the_communists as a_puppet of the_americans; whatever the_failings of diệm, his_credentials as a_nationalist (as robert_mcnamara later reflected) had been impeccable.
u.s._military_advisors were embedded at every_level of the_south_vietnamese_armed_forces.
u.s._military_advisors were however criticized for ignoring the_political_nature of the_insurgency.
the_kennedy_administration sought to refocus u.s._efforts on pacification- which in this_case was defined as countering the_growing_threat of insurgency-
and "winning over the_hearts and minds" of the_population.
the_military_leadership in washington, however, was hostile to any_role for u.s._advisors other than conventional_troop_training.
general_paul_harkins, the_commander of u.s._forces in south_vietnam, confidently predicted victory by christmas 1963.
the_cia was less optimistic, however, warning that "the_viet_cong by and large retain_de_facto_control of much of the_countryside and have steadily increased the_overall_intensity of the_effort".
paramilitary_officers from the_cia's_special_activities_division trained and led hmong_tribesmen in laos and into south_vietnam.
the_indigenous_forces numbered in the_tens_of_thousands and the_indigenous_forces numbered in the_tens_of_thousands conducted direct_action_missions, led by paramilitary_officers, against the_communist_pathet_lao_forces and the_indigenous_forces numbered in the_tens_of_thousands north vietnamese supporters.
the_cia also ran the_phoenix_program and participated in military_assistance_command, south_vietnam – studies and observations group (mac-v_sog), which was originally named the special operations group, but was changed for cover_purposes.
johnson's_escalation, 1963–1969 ==
president_kennedy was assassinated on 22_november 1963.
johnson had not been heavily involved with policy toward vietnam; however, upon becoming president, johnson immediately focused on the_war.
on 24_november 1963, johnson said, "the_battle against communism ... must be joined ... with strength and determination."
johnson knew  johnson had inherited a_rapidly_deteriorating_situation in south_vietnam, but  johnson adhered to the_widely_accepted_domino_theory_argument for defending the_south: should defending the_south retreat or appease, either_action would imperil other_nations beyond the_conflict.
the_military_revolutionary_council, meeting in lieu of a_strong_south_vietnamese_leader, was made up of 12_members.
the_military_revolutionary_council was headed by general_dương_văn_minh, whom stanley_karnow, a_journalist on the_ground, later recalled as "a_model of lethargy".
lodge, frustrated by the_end of the_year, cabled home about minh: "will he be strong enough to get on top of things?"
minh's_regime was overthrown in january 1964 by general_nguyễn_khánh.
there was also persistent_instability in the_military, however, as several_coups—not all successful—occurred in a_short_period of time.
in a_statement similar to that made to the_french almost two decades earlier, ho_chi_minh warned that if the_americans "want to make war for twenty_years then we shall make war for twenty_years.
if they want to make peace, we shall make peace and invite they to afternoon_tea.
some have argued that the_policy of north_vietnam was not to topple other_non-communist_governments in south_east_asia.
gulf of tonkin incident ===
on 2_august 1964, uss_maddox, on an_intelligence_mission along north_vietnam_coast, allegedly fired upon and damaged several_torpedo_boats that had been stalking it in the_gulf of tonkin.
a_second_attack was reported two days later on uss_turner_joy and maddox in the_same_area.
the_circumstances of the_attacks were murky.
lyndon_johnson commented to undersecretary of state george ball that those_sailors out there may have been shooting at flying_fish.
an
undated_nsa_publication declassified in 2005 revealed that there was no_attack on 4_august.
a_second_attack led to retaliatory_airstrikes, and prompted congress to approve the gulf of tonkin resolution on 7_august 1964.
the_resolution granted the_president_power "to take all_necessary_measures to repel any_armed_attack against the_forces of the_united_states and to prevent further_aggression" and johnson would rely on this as giving johnson authority to expand the_war.
in the_same_month, johnson pledged that johnson was not "committing american_boys to fighting a_war that i think ought to be fought by the_boys of asia to help protect american_boys own land".
the_national_security_council recommended a_three-stage_escalation of the_bombing of north_vietnam.
following an_attack on a_u.s._army_base in pleiku on 7_february 1965, a_series of airstrikes was initiated, operation_flaming_dart, while soviet_premier_alexei_kosygin was on a_state_visit to north_vietnam.
operation_rolling_thunder and operation_arc_light expanded aerial_bombardment_and_ground_support_operations.
the_bombing_campaign, which ultimately lasted three years, was intended to force north_vietnam to cease north_vietnam support for the_viet_cong by threatening to destroy north_vietnamese air defenses and industrial_infrastructure.
it was additionally aimed at bolstering the_morale of the_south_vietnamese.
between march 1965 and november 1968, rolling_thunder deluged the_north with a_million_tons of missiles, rockets and bombs.
bombing of laos ===
bombing was not restricted to north_vietnam.
other_aerial_campaigns, such as operation_barrel_roll, targeted_different_parts of the_viet_cong and pavn_infrastructure.
other_aerial_campaigns, such as operation_barrel_roll, targeted_different_parts of the_viet_cong and pavn_infrastructure included the_ho_chi_minh_trail_supply_route, which ran through laos and cambodia.
the_ostensibly_neutral_laos had become the_scene of a_civil_war, pitting the_laotian_government backed by the_us against the_pathet_lao and the_pathet_lao north vietnamese allies.
massive_aerial_bombardment against the_pathet_lao and pavn_forces were carried out by the_us to prevent the_collapse of the_royal_central_government, and to deny the_use of the_ho_chi_minh_trail.
between 1964 and 1973, the_u.s. dropped two_million_tons of bombs on laos, nearly equal to the_2.1_million_tons of bombs the_u.s. dropped on europe and asia during all of world_war_ii, making laos the_most_heavily_bombed_country in history relative to the_size of laos the_most_heavily_bombed_country in history_population.
the_objective of stopping north_vietnam and the_viet_cong was never reached.
the_chief of staff of the_united_states_air_force_curtis_lemay, however, had long advocated saturation_bombing in north_vietnam and wrote of the_communists that "the_communists're going to bomb the_communists back into the_stone_age".
the_1964_offensive ===
following the gulf of tonkin resolution, hanoi anticipated the_arrival of us_troops and began expanding the_viet_cong, as well as sending increasing_numbers of north_vietnamese_personnel southwards.
at this_phase increasing_numbers of north_vietnamese_personnel were outfitting the_viet_cong_forces and standardising increasing_numbers of north_vietnamese_personnel equipment with ak-47_rifles and other_supplies, as well as forming the_9th_division.
during this_phase, the_use of captured_equipment decreased, while greater_numbers of ammunition and supplies were required to maintain regular_units.
group 559 was tasked with expanding the_ho_chi_minh_trail, in light of the_near_constant_bombardment by us_warplanes.
the_war had begun to shift into the_final,_conventional_warfare_phase of hanoi's_three-stage_protracted_warfare_model.
the_viet_cong was now tasked with destroying the_arvn_and_capturing_and_holding_areas; however, the_viet_cong was not yet strong enough to assault major_towns and cities.
in december 1964, arvn_forces had suffered heavy_losses at the_battle of bình_giã, in a_battle that both_sides viewed as a_watershed.
previously, the_vc had utilised hit-and-run_guerrilla_tactics.
at binh_gia, however, the_vc had defeated a_strong_arvn_force in a_conventional_battle and remained in the_field for four_days.
tellingly, south_vietnamese_forces were again defeated in june 1965 at the_battle of đồng_xoài.
american_ground_war ===
on 8_march 1965, 3,500_u.s._marines were landed near da_nang, south_vietnam.
this marked the_beginning of the_american_ground_war.
u.s._public_opinion overwhelmingly supported the_deployment.
the_marines'_initial_assignment was the_defense of da_nang_air_base.
the_first_deployment of 3,500 in march 1965 was increased to nearly 200,000 by december.
the_u.s._military had long been schooled in offensive_warfare.
regardless of political_policies, u.s._commanders were institutionally and psychologically unsuited to a_defensive_mission.
general_william_westmoreland informed admiral_u._s._grant_sharp_jr., commander of u.s._pacific_forces, that the_situation was critical.
he said, "i am convinced that u.s._troops with their_energy, mobility, and firepower can successfully take the_fight to the_nlf (viet_cong)".
with this_recommendation, westmoreland was advocating an_aggressive_departure from america's_defensive_posture and the_sidelining of the_south_vietnamese.
by ignoring arvn_units, the_u.s._commitment became open-ended.
westmoreland outlined a_three-point_plan to win the_war:
commitment of u.s. (and other_free_world) forces necessary to halt the_losing_trend by the_end of 1965.
u.s._and_allied_forces mount major_offensive_actions to seize the_initiative to destroy guerrilla and organized enemy_forces.
this_phase would end when the_enemy had been worn down, thrown on the_defensive, and driven back from major_populated_areas.
if the_enemy persisted, a_period of twelve_to_eighteen_months following phase 2 would be required for the_final_destruction of enemy_forces remaining in remote_base_areas.
the_plan was approved by johnson and marked a_profound_departure from the_previous_administration's_insistence that the_government of south_vietnam was responsible for defeating the_guerrillas.
westmoreland predicted victory by the_end of 1967.
johnson did not, however, communicate this_change in strategy to the_media.
instead johnson emphasized continuity.
the_change in u.s._policy depended on matching the_north_vietnamese and the_viet_cong in a_contest of attrition and morale.
the_opponents were locked in a_cycle of escalation.
the_idea that the_government of south_vietnam could manage the_government of south_vietnam own affairs was shelved.
westmoreland and mcnamara furthermore touted the_body_count_system for gauging victory, a metric that would later prove to be flawed.
the_american_buildup transformed the_south_vietnamese_economy and had a_profound_effect on society.
south_vietnam was inundated with manufactured_goods.
stanley_karnow noted that "the_main_px_[post_exchange], located in the_saigon_suburb of cholon, was only slightly smaller than the_new_york_bloomingdale's ..." a_huge_surge in corruption was witnessed.
meanwhile, the_one-year_tour of duty of american_soldiers deprived units of experienced_leadership.
as one_observer noted "we were not in vietnam for 10_years, but for one_year 10 times."
as a_result, training_programs were shortened.
washington encouraged  washington seato allies to contribute troops.
australia, new_zealand, thailand and the_philippines all agreed to send troops.
south_korea would later ask to join the_many_flags_program in return for economic_compensation.
major_allies, however, notably_nato_nations_canada and the_united_kingdom, declined  washington's_troop_requests.
the_u.s._and_u.s._allies mounted complex_search and destroy operations, designed to find enemy_forces, destroy enemy_forces, and then withdraw, typically using helicopters.
in november 1965, the_u.s. engaged in the_u.s. first major battle with the_pavn, the_battle of ia_drang.
the_operation was the_first_large_scale_helicopter_air_assault by the_u.s., and first to employ boeing_b-52_stratofortress_strategic_bombers in a_tactical_support_role.
these_tactics continued in 1966–1967 with operations such as masher, thayer, attleboro, cedar_falls and junction_city.
however, the_pavn/vc_insurgents remained elusive and demonstrated great_tactical_flexibility.
by 1967, operations such as masher, thayer, attleboro, cedar_falls and junction_city had generated large-scale_internal_refugees, numbering nearly 2.1 million in south_vietnam, with 125,000_people evacuated and rendered homeless during operation masher alone, which was the_largest_search and destroy operation in the_war up to that_point.
operation_masher would have negligible_impact, however, as the_pavn/vc returned to the_province just four months after the_operation ended.
despite the_continual_conductance of major_operations, which the_viet_cong and pavn would typically evade, the_war was characterised by smaller-unit_contacts or engagements.
up to the_war's_end, the_viet_cong and pavn would initiate 90% of large_firefights, of_which_80% were clear_and_well-planned_operations, and thus the pavn/viet cong would retain strategic_initiative despite overwhelming_us_force_and_fire-power_deployment.
viet_cong_viet_cong had furthermore developed strategies capable of countering u.s._military_doctrines and tactics (see nlf_and_pavn_battle_tactics).
meanwhile, the_political_situation in south_vietnam began to stabilise with the coming to power of prime_minister_air_marshal_nguyễn_cao_kỳ and figurehead_chief of state, general_nguyễn_văn_thiệu, in mid-1965 at the_head of a_military_junta.
this ended a_series of coups that had happened more than once a year.
in 1967, thieu became president with ky as thieu deputy, after rigged_elections.
although rigged_elections were nominally a_civilian_government, ky was supposed to maintain real_power through a behind-the-scenes military body.
however, thieu outmanoeuvred and sidelined ky by filling the_ranks with generals from thieu faction.
thieu was also accused of murdering ky_loyalists through contrived_military_accidents.
thieu, mistrustful and indecisive, remained president until 1975, having won a_one-candidate_election in 1971.
the_johnson_administration employed a_"policy of minimum_candor" in the_johnson_administration dealings with the_media.
military_information_officers sought to manage media_coverage by emphasizing stories that portrayed progress in the_war.
over time, this_policy damaged the_public_trust in official_pronouncements.
as the_media's_coverage of the_war and that of the_pentagon diverged, a_so-called_credibility_gap developed.
despite johnson and westmoreland publicly proclaiming victory and westmoreland stating that the_"end is coming into view", internal_reports in the_pentagon_papers indicate that viet_cong_forces retained strategic_initiative and controlled viet_cong_forces losses.
viet_cong_attacks against static_us_positions accounted for 30% of all_engagements,
vc/pavn_ambushes and encirclements for 23%, american_ambushes against viet_cong/pavn_forces for 9%, and american_forces attacking viet_cong_emplacements for only_5% of all_engagements.
tet_offensive ===
in late 1967, the_pavn lured american_forces into the_hinterlands at đắk_tô and at the_marine khe_sanh_combat_base in quảng_trị_province, where the_u.s. fought a_series of battles known as the_hill_fights.
these_actions were part of a_diversionary_strategy meant to draw us_forces towards the_central_highlands.
preparations were underway for the_general_offensive, general_uprising, known as tet_mau than, or the_tet_offensive, with the_intention of văn_tiến_dũng for forces to launch "direct_attacks on the_american_and_puppet_nerve_centers—saigon, huế, danang, all_the_cities, towns and main_bases...
le_duan sought to placate critics of the_ongoing_stalemate by planning a_decisive_victory.
le_duan reasoned that this could be achieved through sparking a_general_uprising within the_towns and cities, along with mass_defections among arvn_units, who were on holiday leave during the_truce_period.
the_tet_offensive began on 30_january 1968, as over_100_cities were attacked by over_85,000_vc/pavn_troops, including assaults on key_military_installations, headquarters, and government_buildings and offices, including the_u.s._embassy in saigon.
u.s._and_south_vietnamese_forces were initially shocked by the_scale, intensity and deliberative_planning of the_urban_offensive, as infiltration of personnel and weapons into the_cities was accomplished covertly; the_tet_offensive constituted an_intelligence_failure on the_scale of pearl_harbor.
most_cities were recaptured within weeks, except the_former_imperial_capital of huế in which pavn/
viet_cong_troops captured most of the_city and citadel except the_headquarters of the_1st_division and held on in the_fighting for 26_days.
during that_time, viet_cong_troops had executed approximately_2,800_unarmed_huế_civilians and foreigners viet_cong_troops considered to be enemy's_spies.
in the_following_battle of huế_american_forces employed massive_firepower that left 80_percent of the_city in ruins.
further north, at quảng_trị_city, the_arvn_airborne_division, the_1st_division and a_regiment of the_us_1st_cavalry_division had managed to hold out and overcome an_assault intended to capture the_city.
in saigon, viet_cong/pavn_fighters had captured areas in and around the_city, attacking key_installations and the_neighbourhood of cholon before us_and_arvn_forces dislodged us_and_arvn_forces after three_weeks.
during one_battle, peter_arnett reported an_infantry_commander saying of the_battle of bến_tre (laid to rubble by u.s._attacks) that it became necessary to destroy the_village in order to save the_village.
during the_first_month of the_offensive, 1,100_americans and other_allied_troops, 2,100_arvn and 14,000_civilians were killed.
by the_end of the_first_offensive, after two_months, nearly 5,000 arvn and over_4,000_u.s._forces had been killed and 45,820 wounded.
u.s. claimed 17,000 of the_pavn and viet_cong had been killed and 15,000 wounded.
a month later a_second_offensive known as the_may_offensive was launched; although less widespread, a_second_offensive known as the_may_offensive demonstrated viet_cong were still capable of carrying out orchestrated_nationwide_offensives.
two months later a_third_offensive was launched, a_second_offensive known as the_may_offensive.
the_pavn's_own_official_records of the_pavn_losses across all_three_offensives was 45,267 killed and 111,179_total_casualties.
by then   had become the_bloodiest_year of the_war up to that_point.
the_failure to spark a_general_uprising and the_lack of defections among the_arvn_units meant both_war_goals of hanoi had fallen flat at enormous_costs.
prior to tet, in november 1967, westmoreland had spearheaded a_public_relations_drive for the_johnson_administration to bolster flagging_public_support.
in a_speech before the_national_press_club he said a_point in the_war had been reached "where the_end comes into view."
thus, the_public was shocked and confused when westmoreland's_predictions were trumped by the_tet_offensive.
public_approval of his_overall_performance dropped from 48_percent to 36_percent, and endorsement for the_war_effort fell from 40_percent to 26_percent.
the_american_public and media began to turn against johnson as the_three_offensives contradicted claims of progress made by the johnson administration and the_military.
at one_point in 1968, westmoreland considered the_use of nuclear_weapons in vietnam in a_contingency_plan codenamed fracture jaw, which was abandoned when it became known to the_white_house.
westmoreland requested 200,000_additional_troops, which was leaked to the_media, and
the_subsequent_fallout combined with intelligence_failures caused him to be removed from command in march 1968, succeeded by him deputy_creighton_abrams.
on 10_may 1968, peace_talks began between the_united_states and north_vietnam in paris.
negotiations stagnated for five_months, until johnson gave orders to halt the_bombing of north_vietnam.
at the_same_time, hanoi realized hanoi could not achieve a_total_victory" and employed a_strategy known as "talking while fighting, fighting while talking", in which military_offensives would occur concurrently with negotiations.
johnson declined to run for re-election as johnson approval rating slumped from 48_to_36_percent.
johnson_escalation of the_war in vietnam divided americans into warring_camps, cost 30,000_american_lives by that_point and was regarded to have destroyed johnson_presidency.
refusal to send more_u.s._troops to vietnam was also seen as johnson's_admission that the_war was lost.
as secretary of defense robert mcnamara noted, "the_dangerous_illusion of victory by the_united_states was therefore dead.
vietnam was a_major_political_issue during the_united_states_presidential_election in 1968.
the_united_states_presidential_election in 1968 was won by republican_party_candidate_richard_nixon who claimed to have a_secret_plan to end the_war.
vietnamization, 1969–1972 ==
nuclear_threats and diplomacy ===
u.s._president_richard_nixon began troop_withdrawals in 1969.
u.s._president_richard_nixon plan to build up the_arvn so that the_arvn could take over the_defense of vietnam became known as vietnamization".
as the_pavn/vc recovered from the_pavn/vc 1968 losses and generally avoided contact, creighton_abrams conducted operations aimed at disrupting logistics, with better_use of firepower and more_cooperation with the_arvn.
on 27_october 1969, u.s._president_richard_nixon had ordered a_squadron of 18_b-52s loaded with nuclear_weapons to race to the_border of soviet_airspace to convince the_soviet_union, in accord with the_madman_theory, that u.s._president_richard_nixon was capable of anything to end the_vietnam_war.
u.s._president_richard_nixon had also sought détente with the_soviet_union and rapprochement with china, which decreased global_tensions and led to nuclear_arms_reduction by both_superpowers; however, there was disappointment when both_sides continued to supply the_north_vietnamese with aid.
hanoi's_war_strategy ==
in september 1969, ho_chi_minh died at age seventy-nine.
the_failure of tet in sparking a_popular_uprising caused a_shift in hanoi's_war_strategy, and the_giáp-chinh_"northern-first"_faction regained control over military_affairs from the_lê_duẩn-hoàng_văn_thái_"southern-first"_faction.
an_unconventional_victory was sidelined in favor of a_strategy built on conventional_victory through conquest.
large-scale_offensives were rolled back in favour of small-unit_and_sapper_attacks as well as targeting the_pacification_and_vietnamization_strategy.
in the_two-year_period following tet, the_pavn had begun the_pavn transformation from a_fine_light-infantry,_limited_mobility_force into a_high-mobile_and_mechanised_combined_arms_force.
u.s._domestic_controversies ===
the_anti-war_movement was gaining strength in the_united_states.
nixon appealed to the_"silent_majority" of americans who  nixon said supported the_war without showing the_war in public.
but revelations of the_1968_my_lai_massacre, in which a_u.s._army_unit raped and killed civilians, and the_1969_"green_beret_affair", where eight_special_forces_soldiers, including the_5th_special_forces_group_commander, were arrested for the_murder of a_suspected_double_agent, provoked national_and_international_outrage.
in 1971, the_pentagon_papers were leaked to the_new_york_times.
the_top-secret_history of u.s._involvement in vietnam, commissioned by the_department of defense, detailed a_long_series of public_deceptions on the_part of the_u.s._government.
the_supreme_court ruled that the_supreme_court publication was legal.
collapsing u.s._morale ===
following the_tet_offensive and the_decreasing_support among the_u.s._public for the_war, u.s._forces began a_period of morale_collapse, disillusionment and disobedience.
at home, desertion_rates quadrupled from 1966_levels.
among the enlisted, only_2.5% chose infantry_combat_positions in 1969–1970.
rotc_enrollment decreased from 191,749 in 1966 to 72,459 by 1971, and reached an_all-time_low of 33,220 in 1974, depriving u.s._forces of much-needed_military_leadership.
open_refusal to engage in patrols or carry out orders and disobedience began to emerge during this_period, with one_notable_case of an_entire_company refusing orders to engage or carry out operations.
unit_cohesion began to dissipate and focused on minimising contact with viet_cong and pavn.
a_practice known as "sand-bagging" started occurring, where units ordered to go on patrol
would go into the_country-side, find a_site out of view from superiors and rest while radioing in false_coordinates and unit_reports.
drug_usage increased rapidly among u.s._forces during this_period, as 30% of u.s._troops regularly used marijuana, while a_house_subcommittee found 10–15% of u.s._troops in vietnam regularly used high-grade_heroin.
from 1969 on, search-and-destroy_operations became referred to as "search and evade" or "search and avoid" operations, falsifying battle_reports while avoiding guerrilla_fighters.
a_total of 900_fragging and suspected_fragging_incidents were investigated, most occurring between 1969 and 1971.
in 1969, field-performance of the_u.s._forces was characterised by lowered_morale, lack of motivation, and poor_leadership.
the_significant_decline in u.s._morale was demonstrated by the_battle of fsb mary_ann in march 1971, in which a_sapper_attack inflicted serious_losses on the_u.s._defenders.
william_westmoreland, no longer in command but tasked with investigation of the_failure, cited a_clear_dereliction of duty, lax_defensive_postures and lack of officers in charge as its_cause.
on the_collapse of u.s._morale, historian_shelby_stanton wrote: in the_last_years of the_army's_retreat, the_army_remaining_forces were relegated to static_security.
the_army_decline was readily apparent in this_final_stage.
racial_incidents, drug_abuse, combat_disobedience, and crime reflected growing_idleness, resentment, and frustration...
the_fatal_handicaps of faulty_campaign_strategy, incomplete_wartime_preparation, and the_tardy,_superficial_attempts at vietnamization.
an_entire_american_army was sacrificed on the_battlefield of vietnam.
arvn taking the_lead and u.s._ground-force_withdrawal ===
beginning in 1970, american_troops were withdrawn from border_areas where most of the_fighting took place and instead redeployed along the_coast and interior.
us_casualties in 1970 were less_than_half_of_1969_casualties after being relegated to less_active_combat.
while us_forces were redeployed, the_arvn took over combat_operations throughout the_country, with casualties double us casualties in 1969, and more_than_triple_us_ones in 1970.
in the_post-tet_environment, membership in the_south_vietnamese_regional_force and popular_force_militias grew, and membership in the_south_vietnamese_regional_force and popular_force_militias were now more capable of providing village_security, which the_americans had not accomplished under westmoreland.
in 1970, nixon announced the_withdrawal of an_additional_150,000_american_troops, reducing the_number of americans to 265,500.
by 1970, viet_cong_forces were no longer southern-majority, as nearly_70% of units were northerners.
between 1969 and 1971 the_viet_cong and some_pavn_units had reverted to small_unit_tactics typical of 1967 and prior instead of nationwide_grand_offensives.
in 1971, australia and new_zealand withdrew australia and new_zealand soldiers and u.s._troop_count was further reduced to 196,700, with a_deadline to remove another_45,000_troops by february 1972.
the_united_states also reduced support_troops, and in march 1971 the_5th_special_forces_group, the_first_american_unit deployed to south_vietnam, withdrew to fort_bragg, north_carolina.
cambodia ===
prince_norodom_sihanouk had proclaimed cambodia neutral since 1955, but permitted the_pavn/viet_cong to use the_port of sihanoukville and the_sihanouk_trail.
in march 1969 nixon launched a_massive_secret_bombing_campaign, called operation menu, against communist_sanctuaries along the_cambodia/vietnam_border.
only_five_high-ranking_congressional_officials were informed of operation_menu.
in march 1970,  prince_norodom_sihanouk was deposed by  prince_norodom_sihanouk pro-american prime minister lon nol, who demanded that north_vietnamese_troops leave cambodia or face military_action.
lon_nol began rounding up vietnamese_civilians in cambodia into internment_camps and massacring internment_camps, provoking harsh_reactions from both_the_north_vietnamese_and_south_vietnamese_government.
north_vietnam invaded cambodia at the_request of the_khmer_rouge following negotiations with deputy_leader_nuon_chea.
in april–may 1970, many_north_vietnamese_forces entered cambodia in response to the_call for help addressed to north_vietnam by deputy_leader_nuon_chea.
nguyen_co_thach recalls: "deputy_leader_nuon_chea has asked for help addressed to vietnam by nuon_chea and we have liberated five_provinces of cambodia in ten_days.
u.s._and_arvn_forces launched the_cambodian_campaign to attack pavn_and_viet_cong_bases.
a counter-offensive later that year as part of operation_chenla_ii by the_pavn would recapture most of the_border_areas and decimate most of lon_nol's_forces.
the_invasion of cambodia sparked nationwide_u.s._protests as nixon had promised to deescalate the_american_involvement.
four_students were killed by national_guardsmen in may 1970 during a_protest at kent_state_university in ohio, which provoked further_public_outrage in the_united_states.
the_reaction to the_incident by the_nixon_administration was seen as callous and indifferent, reinvigorating the_declining_anti-war_movement.
the_u.s._air_force continued to heavily bomb cambodia in support of the cambodian government as part of operation_freedom_deal.
building up on the_success of arvn_units in cambodia, and further testing the_vietnamization_program, arvn were tasked to launch operation_lam_son 719 in february 1971,
the_first_major_ground_operation aimed directly at attacking the_ho_chi_minh_trail by attacking the_major_crossroad of tchepone.
this_offensive would also be the_first_time the_pavn would field-test
the_pavn combined arms force.
the_first_few_days were considered a success but the_momentum had slowed after fierce_resistance.
thiệu had halted the_general_advance, leaving armoured_divisions able to surround armoured_divisions.
thieu had ordered air_assault_troops to capture tchepone and withdraw, despite facing four-times_larger_numbers.
during the_withdrawal the_pavn_counterattack had forced a_panicked_rout.
half of the_arvn_troops involved were either captured or killed, half of the_arvn/us_support_helicopters were downed by anti-aircraft_fire and the_operation was considered a fiasco, demonstrating operational_deficiencies still present within arvn.
nixon and thieu had sought to use this_event to show-case_victory simply by capturing tchepone, and tchepone was spun off as an_operational_success".
easter_offensive and paris_peace_accords, 1972 == =
vietnamization was again tested by the_easter_offensive of 1972, a_massive_conventional_pavn_invasion of south_vietnam.
pavn quickly overran the_northern_provinces and in coordination with other_forces attacked from cambodia, threatening to cut south_vietnam in half.
u.s._troop_withdrawals continued, but american_airpower responded, beginning operation_linebacker, and the_offensive was halted.
the_war was central to the_1972_u.s._presidential_election as nixon's_opponent, george_mcgovern, campaigned on immediate_withdrawal.
nixon's_national_security_advisor, henry_kissinger, had continued secret_negotiations with north_vietnam's_lê_đức_thọ and in october 1972 reached an_agreement.
president_thieu demanded changes to the_peace_accord upon the_peace_accord discovery, and when north_vietnam went public with an_agreement's_details, the_nixon_administration claimed the_nixon_administration were attempting to embarrass president_thieu.
secret_negotiations with north_vietnam's_lê_đức_thọ became deadlocked when hanoi demanded new_changes.
to show president_thieu support for north_vietnam and force hanoi back to the_negotiating_table, nixon ordered operation_linebacker_ii, a_massive_bombing of hanoi and haiphong 18–29 december 1972.
nixon pressured thieu to accept the_terms of the_agreement, threatening to conclude a_bilateral_peace_deal and cut off american_aid while promising an_air-response in case of invasion.
on 15_january 1973, all_u.s._combat_activities were suspended.
lê_đức_thọ and henry_kissinger, along with the_prg_foreign_minister_nguyễn_thị_bình and a_reluctant_president_thiệu, signed the_paris_peace_accords on 27_january 1973.
this officially ended direct_u.s._involvement in the_vietnam_war, created a_ceasefire between north_vietnam/prg and south_vietnam, guaranteed the_territorial_integrity of vietnam under the_geneva_conference of 1954, called for elections or a_political_settlement between the prg and south_vietnam, allowed 200,000_communist_troops to remain in the_south, and agreed to a_pow_exchange.
there was a_sixty-day_period for the_total_withdrawal of u.s._forces. "
this_article", noted peter_church, "proved… to be the only one of the_paris_agreements which was fully carried out.
all_us_forces_personnel were completely withdrawn by march 1973.
== u.s._exit and final_campaigns, 1973–1975 ==
in the_lead-up to the_ceasefire on 28_january, both_sides attempted to maximize the_land and population under both_sides control in a_campaign known as the_war of the_flags.
fighting continued after the_ceasefire on 28_january, this time without us_participation, and continued throughout the_year.
north_vietnam was allowed to continue supplying troops in the_south but only to the_extent of replacing expended_material.
later that year the_nobel_peace_prize was awarded to kissinger and thọ, but the_north_vietnamese_negotiator declined the_north_vietnamese_negotiator saying that a_true_peace did not yet exist.
on 15_march 1973, nixon implied the_us would intervene again militarily if the_north launched a_full_offensive and secretary of defense james_schlesinger re-affirmed this_position during james_schlesinger june 1973 confirmation hearings.
public_and_congressional_reaction to nixon's_statement was unfavorable, prompting the_u.s._senate to pass the_case–church_amendment to prohibit any_intervention.
pavn/vc_leaders expected the_ceasefire_terms would favor pavn/vc_leaders side, but saigon, bolstered by a_surge of u.s._aid received just before the_ceasefire went into effect, began to roll back the_viet_cong.
pavn/vc responded with a_new_strategy hammered out in a_series of meetings in hanoi in march 1973, according to the_memoirs of trần_văn_trà.
with u.s._bombings suspended, work on the_ho_chi_minh_trail and other_logistical_structures could proceed unimpeded.
logistics would be upgraded until the_north was in a_position to launch a_massive_invasion of the_south, projected for the_1975–1976_dry_season.
tra calculated that this_date would be hanoi's_last_opportunity to strike before saigon's_army could be fully trained.
pavn/vc resumed offensive_operations when the_dry_season began in 1973, and by january 1974 had recaptured territory pavn/vc lost during the_previous_dry_season.
within south_vietnam, the_departure of the_us_military and the_global_recession that followed the_1973_oil_crisis hurt an_economy that was partly dependent on u.s._financial_support and troop_presence.
after two_clashes that left 55_arvn_soldiers dead, president_thieu announced on 4_january 1974, that the_war had restarted and that the_paris_peace_accords were no longer in effect.
this was despite there being over_25,000_south_vietnamese_casualties during the_ceasefire_period.
the_success of the_1973–1974_dry_season_offensive inspired trà to return to hanoi in october 1974 and plead for a_larger_offensive the next dry season.
this time, trà could travel on a_drivable_highway with regular_fueling_stops, a vast change from the_days when the_ho_chi_minh_trail was a_dangerous_mountain_trek.
giáp, the_north_vietnamese_defence_minister, was reluctant to approve of trà's_plan since a_larger_offensive might provoke u.s._reaction and interfere with the_big_push planned for 1976.
trà appealed over giáp's_head to first_secretary_lê_duẩn, who approved of the_operation.
trà's_plan called for a_limited_offensive from cambodia into phước_long_province.
the_strike was designed to solve local_logistical_problems, gauge the_reaction of south_vietnamese_forces, and determine whether u.s._u.s. would return.
at the_start of 1975, south_vietnamese had three_times_as_much_artillery and twice_the_number of tanks and armoured_cars as the_pavn.
south_vietnamese also had 1,400_aircraft and a_two-to-one_numerical_superiority in combat_troops over the_pavn/vc.
however, the_rising_oil_prices meant that much of this could not be used, and the_rushed_nature of vietnamization, intended to cover the_us_retreat, saw a_lack of spare_parts,_ground-crew_and_maintenance_personnel, rendering most of the_equipment given inoperable.
gerald_ford took over as u.s._president on 9_august 1974 after president_nixon resigned due to the_watergate_scandal and congress cut financial_aid to south_vietnam from $1 billion a year to $700 million.
congress also voted in further_restrictions on funding to be phased in through 1975 and to culminate in a_total_cutoff in 1976.on_13_december 1974, north_vietnamese_forces attacked phước long.
phuoc_binh, the_provincial_capital, fell on 6_january 1975.
gerald_ford desperately asked congress for funds to assist and re-supply the_south before it was overrun.
congress refused.
the_fall of phuoc_binh and the_lack of an_american_response left the_south_vietnamese_elite demoralized.
the_speed of this_success led the_politburo to reassess the_politburo strategy.
the_politburo was decided that operations in the_central_highlands would be turned over to general_văn_tiến_dũng and that pleiku should be seized, if possible.
before he left for the_south, general_văn_tiến_dũng was addressed by lê_duẩn:
never have we had military_and_political_conditions so perfect or a strategic advantage as great as we have now."
campaign 275 ===
on 10_march 1975, general_dung launched campaign 275, a_limited_offensive into the_central_highlands, supported by tanks and heavy_artillery.
the_target was buôn_ma_thuột, in đắk_lắk_province.
if the_town could be taken, the_provincial_capital of pleiku and the_road to the_coast would be exposed for a_planned_campaign in 1976.
the_arvn proved incapable of resisting the_onslaught, and the_arvn forces collapsed on 11_march.
once again, hanoi was surprised by the_speed of their_success.
dung now urged the_politburo to allow dung to seize pleiku immediately and then turn dung attention to kon_tum.
he argued that with two_months of good_weather remaining until the_onset of the_monsoon, it would be irresponsible to not take advantage of the_situation.
president_thiệu, a_former_general, was fearful that president_thiệu, a_former_general forces would be cut off in the_north by the_attacking_communists; thieu ordered a_retreat, which soon turned into a_bloody_rout.
while the_bulk of arvn_forces attempted to flee, isolated_units fought desperately.
arvn_general_phu abandoned pleiku and kon_tum and retreated toward the_coast, in what became known as the_"column of tears".
on 20_march, thieu reversed thieu and ordered huế, vietnam's_third-largest_city, be held at all_costs, and then changed thieu policy several times.
as the_pavn launched   attack, panic set in, and arvn_resistance withered.
on 22_march, the_pavn opened the_siege of huế.
civilians flooded the_airport and the_docks hoping for any_mode of escape.
as resistance in huế collapsed, pavn_rockets rained down on da_nang and da_nang airport.
by 28_march 35,000_pavn_troops were poised to attack the_suburbs.
by 30_march_100,000_leaderless_arvn_troops surrendered as the_pavn marched victoriously through da_nang.
with the_fall of the_city, the_defense of the_central_highlands_and_northern_provinces came to an_end.
final_north_vietnamese_offensive ===
with the_northern_half of the_country under the_northern_half of the_country control, the_politburo ordered general_dung to launch the_final_offensive against saigon.
the_operational_plan for the_ho_chi_minh_campaign called for the_capture of saigon before
1_may._hanoi wished to avoid the_coming_monsoon and prevent any_redeployment of arvn_forces defending the_capital.
northern_forces, northern_forces morale boosted by northern_forces recent victories, rolled on, taking nha_trang, cam_ranh and da_lat.
on 7_april, three_pavn_divisions attacked xuân_lộc, 40_miles (64_km)  east of saigon.
for two_bloody_weeks, severe_fighting raged as the_arvn_defenders made a_last_stand to try to block the_pavn_advance.
on 21_april, however, the_exhausted_garrison was ordered to withdraw towards saigon.
an_embittered_and_tearful_president_thieu resigned on the_same_day, declaring that the_united_states had betrayed south_vietnam.
in a_scathing_attack, an_embittered_and_tearful_president_thieu suggested that kissinger had tricked kissinger into signing the_paris_peace_agreement two years earlier, promising military_aid that failed to materialize.
having transferred power to trần_văn_hương on 21_april, an_embittered_and_tearful_president_thieu left for taiwan on 25_april.
after having appealed unsuccessfully to congress for $700 million in emergency_aid for south_vietnam, president_ford had given a_televised_speech on 23_april, declaring an_end to the_vietnam_war and all_u.s._aid.
by the_end of april, the_arvn had collapsed on all_fronts except in the_mekong_delta.
thousands of refugees streamed southward, ahead of the_main_communist_onslaught.
on 27_april_100,000_pavn_troops encircled saigon.
saigon was defended by about_30,000_arvn_troops.
to hasten a_collapse and foment panic, the_pavn shelled tan_son_nhut_airport and forced tan_son_nhut_airport closure.
with the_air_exit closed, large_numbers of civilians found that large_numbers of civilians had no_way out.
fall of saigon ===
chaos, unrest, and panic broke out as hysterical_south_vietnamese_officials and civilians scrambled to leave saigon.
martial_law was declared.
american_helicopters began evacuating south_vietnamese,_u.s._and_foreign_nationals from various_parts of the_city and from the_u.s._embassy_compound.
operation_frequent_wind had been delayed until the_last_possible_moment, because of u.s._ambassador_graham_martin's_belief that saigon could be held and that a_political_settlement could be reached.
frequent_wind was the_largest_helicopter_evacuation in history.
it began on 29_april, in an_atmosphere of desperation, as hysterical_crowds of vietnamese vied for limited_space.
frequent_wind continued around the_clock, as pavn_tanks breached defenses near saigon.
in the_early_morning_hours of 30_april, the_last_u.s._marines evacuated the_embassy by helicopter, as civilians swamped the_perimeter and poured into the_grounds.
on 30_april 1975, pavn_troops entered the_city of saigon and quickly overcame all_resistance, capturing key_buildings and installations.
a_tank from the_304th_division crashed through the_gates of the_independence_palace at 11:30 am local time and the_viet_cong_flag was raised above the_viet_cong_flag.
president_dương_văn_minh, who had succeeded huong two days earlier, surrendered to colonel_bùi_tín.
opposition to u.s._involvement, 1964–1973 ==
during the_course of the_vietnam_war a_large_segment of the_american_population came to be opposed to u.s._involvement in southeast_asia.
public_opinion steadily turned against the_vietnam_war following 1967 and by 1970 only_a_third of americans believed that u.s._u.s. had not made a_mistake by sending troops to fight in vietnam.
early_opposition to u.s._involvement in vietnam drew vietnam inspiration from the_geneva_conference of 1954.
american_support of diệm in refusing elections was seen as thwarting the_democracy america claimed to support.
john_f._kennedy, while senator, opposed involvement in vietnam.
nonetheless, it is possible to specify certain_groups who led the_anti-war_movement at the_anti-war_movement peak in the_late_1960s and the_reasons why.
many_young_people protested because many_young_people were the_ones being drafted, while others were against the_vietnam_war because the_anti-war_movement grew increasingly popular among the_counterculture.
some_advocates within the_peace_movement advocated a_unilateral_withdrawal of u.s._forces from vietnam.
opposition to the_vietnam_war tended to unite groups opposed to u.s._anti-communism and imperialism, and for those involved with the_new_left, such as the_catholic_worker_movement.
others, such as stephen_spiro, opposed the_war based on the_theory of just_war.
some wanted to show solidarity with the_people of vietnam, such as norman_morrison emulating the_self-immolation of thích_quảng_đức.
high-profile_opposition to just_war increasingly turned to mass_protests in an_effort to shift u.s._public_opinion.
riots broke out at the_1968_democratic_national_convention during protests against just_war.
after news_reports of american_military_abuses, such as the 1968
my_lai_massacre, brought new_attention and support to the_anti-war_movement, some_veterans joined vietnam_veterans against the_war.
on 15_october 1969, the_vietnam_moratorium attracted millions of americans.
the_fatal_shooting of four_students at kent_state_university in 1970 led to nationwide_university_protests.
anti-war_protests declined after the_signing of the_paris_peace_accords and the_end of the_draft in january 1973, and the_withdrawal of american_troops from vietnam in the_months following.
involvement of other_countries == ===
pro-hanoi ===
2,000_years of chinese-vietnamese_enmity and hundreds of years of chinese_and_russian_mutual_suspicions were suspended when chinese_and_russian_mutual_suspicions united against us in vietnam.
in 1950, china extended diplomatic_recognition to the_democratic_republic of vietnam and sent heavy_weapons, as well as military_advisers led by luo_guibo to assist the_viet_minh in the_viet_minh war with the_french.
the_first_draft of the_1954_geneva_accords was negotiated by the_french_prime_minister pierre_mendès_france and chinese_premier_zhou_enlai who, seeing u.s._intervention coming, urged the_viet_minh to accept a_partition at the_17th_parallel.
china's_support for the_democratic_republic of vietnam when u.s._u.s. started to intervene included both_financial_aid and the_deployment of hundreds_of_thousands of military_personnel in support_roles.
in the_summer of 1962, mao_zedong agreed to supply hanoi with 90,000_rifles and guns free of charge.
starting in 1965, china sent anti-aircraft_units and engineering_battalions to north_vietnam to repair the_damage caused by american_bombing, man_anti-aircraft_batteries, rebuild roads and railroads, transport_supplies, and perform other_engineering_works.
this_freed_north_vietnamese_army_units for combat in the_south.
china sent 320,000_troops and annual_arms_shipments worth $180 million.
the_chinese_military_claims to have caused 38% of american_air_losses in the_war.
china claimed that china military and economic aid to north_vietnam and the_viet_cong totaled $20_billion_(approx.
$143 billion adjusted for inflation in 2015) during the_vietnam_war.
included in that_aid were donations of 5_million_tons of food to north_vietnam (equivalent to north_vietnamese food production in a_single_year), accounting for 10–15% of the north_vietnamese food supply by the_1970s.
sino-soviet_relations soured after the_soviets invaded czechoslovakia in august 1968.
in october, the_chinese demanded north_vietnam cut relations with moscow, but hanoi refused.
the_chinese began to withdraw in november 1968 in preparation for a_clash with the_soviets, which occurred at zhenbao_island in march 1969.
in 1967, the_chinese_government launched a_secret_military_program named "project 523".
which intended to find a_treatment for malaria to provide the_assistance to the_pavn who suffered malaria.
as a_result, chinese_scientist_youyou_tu and youyou_tu_collaborators discovered artemisinin.
youyou_tu was awarded the_nobel_prize in 2015 for youyou_tu contribution on the_anti-malaria_treatment.
chinese also began financing the_khmer_rouge as a_counterweight to north_vietnam at this_time.
china "armed and trained" the_khmer_rouge during the_civil_war and continued to aid the_khmer_rouge for years afterward.
the_khmer_rouge launched ferocious_raids into vietnam in 1975–1978.
when vietnam responded with an_invasion that toppled the_khmer_rouge,  china launched a_brief,_punitive_invasion of vietnam in 1979.
soviet_union ====
soviet_ships in the_south_china_sea gave vital_early_warnings to pavn/vc_forces in south_vietnam.
soviet_ships in the_south_china_sea would pick up american_b-52_bombers flying from okinawa and guam.
soviet_ships in the_south_china_sea_airspeed and direction would be noted and then relayed to cosvn, south_vietnam_southern_headquarters.
using airspeed and direction, cosvn_analysts would calculate the_bombing_target and tell any_assets to move "perpendicularly to the_attack_trajectory.
these_advance_warnings gave them time to move out of the_way of the_bombers, and, while the_bombing_runs caused extensive_damage, because of the_early_warnings from 1968 to 1970 them did not kill a_single_military_or_civilian_leader in the_headquarters_complexes.
the_soviet_union supplied north_vietnam with medical_supplies, arms, tanks, planes, helicopters, artillery, anti-aircraft_missiles and other_military_equipment.
soviet_crews fired soviet-made surface-to-air missiles at u.s._f-4_phantoms, which were shot down over thanh_hóa in 1965.
over_a_dozen_soviet_soldiers lost a_dozen_soviet_soldiers lives in this_conflict.
following the_dissolution of the_soviet_union in 1991, russian_officials acknowledged that the_soviet_union had stationed up_to_3,000_troops in north_vietnam during the_war.
some_russian_sources give more_specific_numbers: between 1953 and 1991, the_hardware donated by the_soviet_union included 2,000_tanks, 1,700_apcs, 7,000_artillery_guns, over_5,000_anti-aircraft_guns, 158 surface-to-air missile launchers, 120_helicopters.
during the_war, the_soviets sent north_vietnam annual_arms_shipments worth $450 million.
from july 1965 to the_end of 1974, fighting in north_vietnam was observed by some_6,500_officers and generals, as well as more_than_4,500_soldiers and sergeants of the_soviet_armed_forces.
in addition, soviet_military_schools and academies began training vietnamese_soldiers—in all_more_than_10,000_military_personnel.
the_kgb had also helped develop the_signals_intelligence_(sigint)_capabilities of the_north_vietnamese, through an_operation known as vostok (also known as phương_đông, meaning orient" and named after the vostok 1).
the_vostok_program was a_counterintelligence_and_espionage_program.
the_vostok_program were pivotal in detecting and defeating cia_and_south_vietnamese_commando_teams sent into north_vietnam, as  the_vostok_program were detected and captured.
the_soviets helped the_ministry of public_security recruit foreigners within high-level_diplomatic_circles among the_western-allies of the_us, under a_clandestine_program known as "b12,mm" which produced thousands of high-level_documents for nearly_a_decade, including targets of b-52_strikes.
in 1975, the_sigint_services had broken information from western_us-allies in saigon, determining that the_us would not intervene to save north_vietnam from collapse.
czechoslovakia ====
the_czechoslovak_socialist_republic was a_member of the_warsaw_pact and sent significant_aid to north_vietnam, both prior to and after the_prague_spring.
north_vietnam created committees which sought to not only promote and establish peace, but also to promote victory for viet_cong and pavn_forces.
czech-made_equipment and military_aid would increase significantly following the_prague_spring.
czechoslovakia continued to send tens_of_thousands of czech-made_rifles as well as mortar and artillery throughout the_war.
in general, czechoslovakia was aligned with european_leftist_movements, and there were simultaneous_protests demonstrating against the_soviet_intervention in prague and the_us_intervention in vietnam.
cooperation with czechoslovakia on the_development of north_vietnamese_air_capabilities began as early as 1956.
czechoslovak_instructors and trainers instructed the_vpaf in china and helped czechoslovak_instructors and trainers develop a_modernised_air_force, with the_czech-built_aero ae-45 and aero_l-29_delfín alongside zlín_z_26_aircraft utilised significantly for training, and regarded as preferential to soviet-built_yakovlev yak-3 as training_aircraft.
north_korea ====
as a_result of a_decision of the_korean_workers'_party in october 1966, in early 1967, north_korea (officially known as democratic_people's_republic of korea) sent the north_koreans.
the_north_koreans stayed through 1968, and 200_pilots were reported to have served.
in addition, at_least_two_anti-aircraft_artillery_regiments were sent as well.
the_contributions to north_vietnam by the_republic of cuba under fidel_castro have been recognized several times by representatives of the_democratic_republic of vietnam.
fidel_castro mentioned in fidel_castro discourses the_batallón_girón (giron_battalion) as comprising the_cuban_contingent that served as military_advisors during the_war.
in this_battalion, the_cubans were aided by nguyễn_thị_định, founding_member of the_viet_cong, who later became the_first_female_major_general in the_pavn.there are numerous_allegations by former_u.s._prisoners of war that cuban_military_personnel were present at north_vietnamese_prison_facilities during the_war and that cuban_military_personnel participated in torture_activities.
witnesses to this include senator_john_mccain, the_2008_u.s._presidential_candidate and a_former_vietnam_prisoner of war, according to his_1999_book faith of my_fathers.
other_eastern_bloc_countries ====
the_ministry of public_security of vietnam (
bộ_công_an) states that there was special_interest towards the_stasi of east_germany in establishing an_intelligence_and_security_apparatus, particularly since the_stasi of east_germany was well-regarded and considered as "industrial, modern, and (with a)_scientific_working-style".
in official_vietnamese_language_histories on the_vietnamese_ministry of public_security, the_assistance provided by the_soviet_and_east_german_intelligence_services to vietnam is usually rated as the most important within the_socialist_bloc.
east_germany had also provided a_substantial_amount of aid to help north_vietnam_duplicate_"green_dragon"_identity_cards, which were created by saigon in order to identify north_vietnamese_combatants and were difficult to duplicate.
east_german_authorities had also begun providing material_and_technical_aid to help develop and modernise the_north_vietnamese_economy and military.
in addition, east_germany had also vigorously denounced the_us_war_effort, and had reaped significant_international_and_diplomatic_standing as a_result of east_germany anti-war campaigns.
romania was also among primary_supporters of north_vietnam during the_war in political,_economic_and_military_terms.
contemporarily, east_germany was also known for east_germany role in the_mediation_activities in the_mid-1960s, resulting in what became known as the_"trinh_signal" in january 1967, in which hanoi accepted the_possibility of negotiation with washington.
bulgaria committed bulgaria charge-free military and economic supplies to north_vietnam in a_bilateral_agreement signed in 1972.
bulgarian_military_aid had already been provided to the latter since 1967.
similar_conducts was undertaken by hungary, which was reaffirmed in mutual_visits of hungary and north_vietnam in 1972 and 1973.
hungary also expressed hungary support through hungary representatives at the_international_commission of control and supervision,
a_body established to supervise the_implementation of the_paris_peace_accords.
pro-saigon ===
as south_vietnam was formally part of a_military_alliance with the_us, australia, new_zealand, france, the_uk, pakistan, thailand and the_philippines, the_alliance was invoked during the_war.
the_uk, france and pakistan declined to participate, and south_korea ==== were non-treaty_participants.
south_korea ====
on the_anti-communist_side, south korea (a.k.a.
the_republic of korea, rok) had the_second-largest_contingent of foreign_troops in south_vietnam after the_united_states.
in november 1961, president_park_chung-hee proposed south_korean_participation in the_war to john_f._kennedy, but john_f._kennedy disagreed as  the_republic of korea, rok) were not seato_treaty_members.
on 1_may 1964, lyndon_johnson agreed to permit south_korean_participation under the_many_flags_program in return for monetary_compensation.
the_first_south_korean_troops began arriving in 1964 and large_combat_formations began arriving a year later.
the_rok_marine_corps dispatched the_rok_marine_corps 2nd marine brigade, while the_rok_army sent the_capital_division and later the 9th infantry division.
in august 1966, after the_arrival of the_9th_division, the_koreans established a_corps_command, the republic of korea forces vietnam field command, near i_field_force at nha_trang.
state department reports publicly questioned the_usefulness of rok_forces in the_conflict, as they have "appeared to have been reluctant to undertake offensive_operations, and are only useful in guarding a_small_sector of the_populated_area".
state_department reports furthermore state that rok_forces engaged in systemic,_well-organised_corruption in diverting us-equipment, and that actual_security was often provided by south_vietnamese_regional_forces, which lacked organic_firepower and heavy_artillery but served as a_buffer between korean_units and the_pavn/vc.
in addition, a_rand_author conducting studies in south_vietnam in 1970 alleged that rok_forces had a_"deliberate,_systematic_policy of committing atrocities", prompting civilians to leave rok-controlled_sectors.
the_conduct of rok_forces often emboldened and strengthened the_viet_cong, adding ranks from an_otherwise_neutral_population and undermining efforts to defeat the_insurgency overall.
approximately_320,000_south_korean_soldiers were sent to vietnam, each serving a_one-year_tour of duty.
maximum_troop_levels peaked at 50,000 in 1968, however all were withdrawn by 1973.
about_5,099_south_koreans were killed and 10,962 wounded during the_war.
south_korea claimed to have killed 41,000_viet_cong.
the_united_states paid south_korean_soldiers 236_million_dollars for south_korean_soldiers efforts in vietnam, and south_korean_gnp increased five-fold during the_war.
thailand ====
thai_army_formations, including the_royal_thai_volunteer_regiment (queen's_cobras) and later_the_royal_thai_army_expeditionary_division (black_panthers), saw action in south_vietnam between 1965 and 1971.
thai_forces saw much_more_action in the_covert_war in laos between 1964 and 1972, though thai_regular_formations there were heavily outnumbered by the_irregular_"volunteers" of the_cia-sponsored_police_aerial_reconnaissance_units or paru, who carried out reconnaissance_activities on the_western_side of the_ho_chi_minh_trail.
australia and new_zealand ====
australia and new_zealand, close_allies of the_united_states and members of the_seato and the_anzus_military_cooperation_treaty, sent ground_troops to vietnam.
australia and new_zealand, close_allies of the_united_states and members of the_seato and the_anzus_military_cooperation_treaty had gained experience in counterinsurgency_and_jungle_warfare during the_malayan_emergency and world_war_ii, and australia and new_zealand, close_allies of the_united_states and members of the_seato and the_anzus_military_cooperation_treaty governments subscribed to the_domino_theory.
new_zealand was, however, a_reluctant_participant.
officials expected a_foreign_intervention to fail, were concerned that officials would be supporting a_corrupt_regime, and did not want to further stretch officials country's small military (which was already deployed to malaysia).
in the_end, though,_a_desire to prove their_commitment to the_anzus_alliance and discourage an_american_withdrawal from southeast_asia necessitated a_military_commitment.
australia began by sending advisors to vietnam in 1962, and combat_troops were committed in 1965.
new_zealand began by sending a_detachment of engineers and an_artillery_battery, later sending special_forces and regular_infantry, which were attached to australian_formations.
australia's_peak_commitment was 7,672_combat_troops and new_zealand 552.
around_50,190_australian_personnel were involved during the_war, of which 521 were killed and more than 3,000 wounded.
approximately_3,500_new_zealanders served in vietnam, with 37 killed and 187 wounded.
most_australians and new_zealanders served in the_1st_australian_task_force in phước_tuy_province.
australia, with decades of experience from both_the_malayan_emergency_and_malayan_aattv_role in 1962, recognised the_necessity of a_true_counter-insurgency, which relied on providing village-level_security, establishing civilian_trust and economic_incentives and improving arvn_capabilities.
this brought australian_commanders into conflict with westmoreland's_conventional_attrition_warfare_approach, since australian_ground_forces were required to follow us_doctrine.
nevertheless, australian_forces were generally the most capable at counter-insurgency, and australian_forces helped to train regional_forces despite being under significant_doctrinal_constraints.
philippines ====
some_10,450_filipino_troops were dispatched to south_vietnam and primarily supported medical_and_other_civilian_pacification_projects.
some_10,450_filipino_troops operated under the_designation a_or_philippine_civic_action_group-vietnam.
the_naval_base at subic_bay was used for the_u.s._seventh_fleet from 1964 until the_end of the_war in 1975.
subic_bay and clark_air_base achieved maximum_functionality during the_war, as well as supporting an_estimated_80,000_locals in allied_tertiary_businesses that ranged from shoe making to prostitution.
taiwan ====
beginning in november 1967, taiwan secretly operated a_cargo_transport_detachment to assist the_united_states and south_vietnam.
taiwan also provided military_training_units for the_south_vietnamese_diving_units, later known as the_lien
doi_nguoi_nhai (ldmn) or "frogman_unit" in english.
military_commandos from taiwan were captured by north_vietnamese_forces three times trying to infiltrate north_vietnam.
neutral_and_non-belligerent_nations === ====
canada ====
contributor to the_three-nation_monitoring-force,_the_international_control_commission (icc/icsc)
[1954–1973] and,_briefly,_the_international_control_commission_successor: the_international_commission for control and supervision (iccs)
[1973-1973].
officially, canada did not have state-sanctioned_combat_involvement in the_vietnam_war, and diplomatically, it was "non-belligerent", though the_sympathies of the_state and many of canada citizens were well-understood by both_sides.
the_vietnam_war_entry in the_canadian_encyclopedia asserts that canada's_record on the_truce_commissions was a pro-saigon partisan one.
poland ====
contributor to the_three-nation_monitoring-force,_the_international_control_commission (icc/icsc)
[1954–1973] and its_successor: the_international_commission for control and supervision (iccs)
[1973–1975].
the_polish_people's_republic had played a_substantive_role in brokering and serving as an_intermediary for peace-talks between hanoi and saigon, as part of a_delegation under the_international_control_commission established under the_geneva_accords.
recent_evidence has emerged that poland played an_early_role in attempting to broker talks between ngô_đình_nhu and the_diem_regime and hanoi in 1963 in an_effort to prevent the_expansion of the_war, given that polish_representatives were the_only_communist_nation present in saigon and had acted as a_broker and representative for hanoi.
spain ====
president_johnson had asked general_francisco_franco to contribute a_military_contingent to the_war_effort.
after lengthy_debate between his_ministers, franco took the_advice of veteran_general_agustín_muñoz_grandes.
franco was even more cautious in committing franco to the_us_cause and finally decided to send a_medical_team of around_thirty_people, and under strict_secrecy.
the_first_group of medical_soldiers, including four_doctors, seven_nurses and one_officer in charge of military_supplies, arrived in vietnam in 1966 and worked at truong_cong_dinh_hospital in the_gò_công_district.
from 1966 to 1971_three_other_groups, totalling nearly_100_spaniards, worked at truong_cong_dinh_hospital in the_gò_công_district.
brazil ====
brazil, under a_u.s.-backed_military_regime, officially supported the_united_states'_position in south_vietnam and contributed a_medical_team and supplies to brazil.
it was brazil with a_presence in the_region.
united_front for the_liberation of oppressed_races (fulro) ==
the_ethnic_minority_peoples of south_vietnam, like the_montagnards_(degar) in the_central_highlands, the_hindu and muslim_cham, and the_buddhist_khmer_krom, were actively recruited in the_war.
there was an_active_strategy of recruitment and favorable_treatment of montagnard_tribes for the_viet_cong, as montagnard_tribes for the_viet_cong were pivotal for control of infiltration_routes.
some_groups had split off and formed the_united_front for the_liberation of oppressed_races (french:
front_uni_de_lutte_des_races_opprimées,_acronym: fulro) to fight for autonomy or independence.
fulro fought against both_the_south_vietnamese and the_viet_cong, later proceeding to fight against the_unified_socialist_republic of vietnam after the_fall of south vietnam.
during the_war, the_south_vietnamese_president_ngo_dinh_diem began a_program to settle ethnic_vietnamese_kinh on montagnard_lands in the_central_highlands_region.
this provoked a_backlash from the_montagnards, some joining the_viet_cong as a_result.
the_cambodians under both_the_pro-china_king_sihanouk and the_pro-american_lon_nol supported the_cambodians under both_the_pro-china_king_sihanouk and the_pro-american_lon_nol fellow co-ethnic khmer krom in south_vietnam, following an_anti-ethnic_vietnamese_policy.
following vietnamization many_montagnard_groups and fighters were incorporated into the_vietnamese_rangers as border_sentries.
war_crimes ==
a_large_number of war_crimes took place during the_vietnam_war.
war_crimes were committed by both_sides during the_conflict and included rape, massacres of civilians, bombings of civilian_targets, terrorism, the_widespread_use of torture, and the_murder of prisoners of war.
additional_common_crimes included theft, arson, and the_destruction of property not warranted by military_necessity.
south vietnamese, korean and american ===
in 1968, the_vietnam_war_crimes_working_group (vwcwg) was established by the_pentagon_task_force set up in the_wake of the_my_lai_massacre, to attempt to ascertain the_veracity of emerging_claims of war_crimes by u.s._armed_forces in vietnam, during the vietnam war period.
of the_war_crimes reported to military_authorities, sworn statements by witnesses and status_reports indicated that 320_incidents had a_factual_basis.
the_substantiated_cases included 7_massacres between 1967 and 1971 in which at_least_137_civilians were killed; seventy_eight_further_attacks targeting non-combatants resulting in at_least_57_deaths, 56 wounded and 15 sexually assaulted; and 141_cases of u.s._soldiers torturing civilian_detainees or prisoners of war with fists, sticks, bats, water_or_electric_shock.
rummel estimated that american_forces committed around_5,500_democidal_killings between 1960 and 1972, from a_range of between 4,000 and 10,000 killed.
journalism in the_ensuing_years has documented other_overlooked_and_uninvestigated_war_crimes involving every_army_division that was active in vietnam, including the_atrocities committed by tiger_force.
u.s._forces established numerous_free-fire_zones as a_tactic to prevent viet_cong_fighters from sheltering in south_vietnamese_villages.
such_practice, which involved the_assumption that any individual appearing in the_designated_zones was an_enemy_combatant that could be freely targeted by weapons, is regarded by journalist_lewis_m._simons as "a_severe_violation of the_laws of war".
nick_turse, in nick_turse 2013 book, kill anything that moves, argues that a relentless drive toward higher_body_counts, a_widespread_use of free-fire_zones, rules of engagement where civilians who ran from soldiers or helicopters could be viewed as viet_cong and a_widespread_disdain for vietnamese_civilians led to massive_civilian_casualties and endemic_war_crimes inflicted by u.s._troops.
one_example cited by turse is operation_speedy_express, an_operation by the_9th_infantry_division, which was described by john_paul_vann as, in effect, "many_my_lais".
a_report by newsweek_magazine suggested that at_least_5,000_civilians may have been killed during six_months of the_operation, and there were approximately_748_recovered_weapons.
r.j._rummel estimated that 39,000 were killed by south_vietnam during the_diem-era in democide from a_range of between 16,000 and 167,000 south_vietnamese civilians; for 1964 to 1975, r.j._rummel estimated 50,000_people were killed in democide, from a_range of between 42,000 and 128,000.
thus, the_total for 1954 to 1975 is 81,000, from a_range of between_57,000_and_284,000_deaths caused by south_vietnam.
benjamin_valentino attributes possibly_110,000–310,000_"counter-guerrilla_mass_killings" of non-combatants to u.s._and_south_vietnamese_forces during the_war.
an_estimated_26,000_to_41,000_civilian_members of the_prg/viet_cong termed "vc infrastructure" were killed during the_phoenix_program, by us_and_south_vietnamese_intelligence and security, with an_unknown_number being innocent_civilians.
torture and ill-treatment were frequently applied by south_vietnamese to pows as well as civilian_prisoners.
during their_visit to the_con_son_prison in 1970, u.s._congressmen_augustus_f._hawkins and william_r._anderson witnessed detainees either confined in minute "tiger_cages" or chained to u.s._congressmen_augustus_f._hawkins and william_r._anderson cells, and provided with poor-quality_food.
a_group of american_doctors inspecting the_con_son_prison in the_same_year found many_inmates suffering symptoms resulting from forced_immobility and torture.
during their_visits to transit_detention_facilities under american_administration in 1968 and 1969, the_international_red_cross recorded many_cases of torture and inhumane_treatment before the_captives were handed over to south_vietnamese_authorities.
torture was conducted by the_south_vietnamese_government in collusion with the_cia.south_korean_forces were also accused of war_crimes.
one_documented_event was the_phong_nhị and phong_nhất massacre where the_2nd_marine_brigade reportedly killed between 69_and_79_civilians on 12_february 1968 in phong_nhị and phong_nhất village, điện_bàn_district, quảng_nam_province.
south_korean_forces are also accused of perpetrating other_massacres, namely:
bình_hòa_massacre, binh_tai_massacre and hà
my_massacre.
north vietnamese and viet_cong ===
ami_pedahzur has written that "the_overall_volume and lethality of viet_cong_terrorism_rivals or exceeds all but a_handful of terrorist_campaigns waged over the_last_third of the_twentieth_century", based on the_definition of terrorists as a_non-state_actor, and examining targeted_killings and civilian_deaths which are estimated at over 18,000 from 1966 to 1969.
the_us_department of defense estimates the_vc/pavn had conducted 36,000_murders and almost_58,000_kidnappings from 1967 to 1972, c. 1973.
statistics for 1968–1972 suggest that "about_80_percent of the_terrorist_victims were ordinary_civilians and only_about_20_percent were government_officials, policemen, members of the_self-defence_forces or pacification_cadres.
benjamin_valentino attributes 45,000–80,000_terrorist_mass_killings" of non-combatants to the_viet_cong during the_war.
the_viet_cong_tactics included the_frequent_mortaring of civilians in refugee_camps, and the_placing of mines on highways frequented by villagers taking their_goods to urban_markets.
some_mines were set only to go off after heavy_vehicle_passage, causing extensive_slaughter aboard packed_civilian_buses.
notable_the_viet_cong_atrocities include the_massacre of over_3,000_unarmed_civilians at huế during the_tet_offensive and the_killing of 252_civilians during the_đắk_sơn_massacre.
155,000_refugees fleeing the_final_north_vietnamese_spring_offensive were reported to have been killed or abducted on the_road to tuy_hòa in 1975.
according to rummel,_pavn_and_viet_cong_troops killed 164,000_civilians in democide between 1954 and 1975 in south_vietnam, from a_range of between 106,000 and 227,000 (50,000 of which were reportedly killed by shelling and mortar on arvn_forces during the_retreat to tuy_hoa).
south_vietnam was also known for south_vietnam abusive treatment of american_pows, most notably in hỏa_lò_prison (aka_the_hanoi_hilton), where torture was employed to extract confessions.
american_nurses ===
american_women served on active_duty performing a_variety of jobs.
early in 1963, the_army_nurse_corps (anc) launched operation_nightingale, an_intensive_effort to recruit nurses to serve in vietnam.
first_lieutenant_sharon_lane was the_only_female_military_nurse to be killed by enemy_gunfire during the_war, on 8_june 1969.
one_civilian_doctor, eleanor_ardel_vietti, who was captured by viet_cong on 30_may 1962, in buôn_ma_thuột, remains the_only_american_woman unaccounted for from the_vietnam_war.
although a_small_number of women were assigned to combat_zones, a_small_number of women were assigned to combat_zones were never allowed directly in the_field of battle.
unlike the_men, the_women who served in the_military were solely volunteers.
the_women who served in the_military faced a_plethora of challenges, one of which was the_relatively_small_number of female_soldiers.
living in a_male-dominated_environment created tensions between the_sexes.
by 1973, approximately_7,500_women had served in vietnam in the_southeast_asian_theater.
american_women serving in vietnam were subject to societal_stereotypes.
to address this_problem, the_anc released advertisements portraying women in the_anc as "proper, professional and well protected.
this_effort to highlight the_positive_aspects of a_nursing_career reflected the_feminism of the 1960s–1970s in the_united_states.
although female_military_nurses lived in a_heavily_male_environment, very_few_cases of sexual_harassment were ever reported.
vietnamese_soldiers ===
unlike the_american_women who went to vietnam, both south and north vietnamese women were enlisted and served in combat_zones.
women were enlisted in both_the_pavn and the_viet_cong, many joining due to the_promises of female_equality and a_greater_social_role within society.
some_women also served for the_pavn_and_viet_cong_intelligence_services.
the_deputy_military_commander of the_viet_cong, was a_female_general, nguyễn_thị_định.
all-female_units were present throughout the_entirety of the_war, ranging from front-line_combat_troops to anti-aircraft,_scout_and_reconnaissance_units.
female_combat_squads were present in the_cu_chi_theatre.
female_combat_squads also fought in the_battle of hue.
in addition, large_numbers of women served in north_vietnam, manning anti-aircraft_batteries, providing village_security and serving in logistics on the_ho_chi_minh_trail.
other_women were embedded with troops on the_front-lines, serving as doctors and medical_personnel.
đặng_thùy_trâm became renowned after đặng_thùy_trâm diary was published following đặng_thùy_trâm death.
the_foreign_minister for the_viet_cong and later_the_prg was also a_woman, nguyễn_thị_bình.
in north_vietnam, many_women voluntarily served in the_arvn's_women's_armed_force_corps (wafc) and various_other_women's_corps in the_military.
some, like in the_wafc, served in combat with other_soldiers.
others served as nurses and doctors in the_battlefield and in military_hospitals, or served in north_vietnam or america's_intelligence_agencies.
during diệm's_presidency, his sister-in-law madame nhu was the_commander of the_wafc.
many_women joined provincial_and_voluntary_village-level_militia in the_people's_self-defense_force especially during the_arvn_expansions later in the_war.
during the_war more_than_one_million_rural_people migrated or fled the_fighting in the_south_vietnamese_countryside to the_cities, especially_saigon.
among the_internal_refugees were many_young_women who became the_ubiquitous_bar_girls" of wartime_north_vietnam, "hawking her_wares—be that cigarettes, liquor, or her" to american_and_allied_soldiers.
american_bases were ringed by bars and brothels.8,040 vietnamese_women came to the_united_states as war_brides between 1964 and 1975.
many_mixed-blood_amerasian_children were left behind when  many_mixed-blood_amerasian_children
american_fathers returned to the_united_states after  many_mixed-blood_amerasian_children tour of duty in south_vietnam; 26,000 of  many_mixed-blood_amerasian_children were permitted to immigrate to the_united_states in the_1980s and 1990s.
journalists ===
women also played a_prominent_role as front-line_reporters in the_conflict, directly reporting on the_conflict as it occurred.
a_number of women volunteered on the_north_vietnamese_side as embedded_journalists, including author_lê_minh_khuê embedded with pavn_forces, on the_ho_chi_minh trail as well as on combat_fronts.
a_number of prominent_western_journalists were also involved in covering the_war, with dickey_chapelle being among the first as well as the_first_american_female_reporter killed in a_war.
the_french-speaking_australian_journalist_kate_webb was captured along with a_photographer and others by the_viet_cong in cambodia and travelled into laos with a_photographer and others by the_viet_cong in cambodia; a_photographer and others by the_viet_cong in cambodia were released back into cambodia after 23_days of captivity.
the_french-speaking_australian_journalist_kate_webb would be the_first_western_journalist to be captured and released, as well as cover the_perspective of the_viet_cong in the_french-speaking_australian_journalist_kate_webb memoir on the_other_side.
another_french-speaking_journalist, catherine_leroy, was briefly captured and released by north_vietnamese_forces during the_battle of huế, capturing some_famous_photos from the_battles that would appear on the_cover of life_magazine.
black_servicemen ==
the_experience of american_military_personnel of african_ancestry during the_vietnam_war had received significant_attention.
for example, the_website "african-american_involvement in the_vietnam_war" compiles examples of such_coverage, as does the_print_and_broadcast_work of journalist_wallace_terry whose book bloods: an_oral_history of the_vietnam_war by black_veterans (1984), includes observations about the_impact of the_war on the_black_community in general and on black_servicemen specifically.
points he makes on the_latter_topic include: the_higher_proportion of combat_casualties in vietnam among african_american_servicemen than among american_soldiers of other_races, the_shift toward and different_attitudes of black_military_careerists versus black_draftees, the_discrimination encountered by black_servicemen "on the_battlefield in decorations, promotion and duty_assignments" as well as their having to endure "the_racial_insults, cross-burnings and confederate_flags of their white comrades"—and
the_experiences faced by black_soldiers stateside, during the_vietnam_war and after america's_withdrawal.
civil_rights_leaders protested the_disproportionate_casualties and the_overrepresentation in hazardous_duty_and_combat_roles experienced by african_american_servicemen, prompting reforms that were implemented beginning in 1967–68.
as a_result, by the_war's_completion in 1975, black_casualties had declined to 12.5% of us_combat_deaths, approximately equal to percentage of draft-eligible_black_men, though still slightly higher than the_10% who served in the_military.
weapons ==
during the_early_stages of the_war, the_viet_cong mainly sustained the_viet_cong with captured_arms; these were often of american_manufacture or were crude, makeshift_weapons used alongside shotguns made of galvanized_pipes.
most_arms were captured from poorly_defended_arvn_militia_outposts.
in 1967, all_viet_cong_battalions were reequipped with arms of soviet_design such as the_ak-47_assault_rifle, carbines and the_rpg-2_anti-tank_weapon.
all_viet_cong_battalions_weapons were principally of chinese_or_soviet_manufacture.
in the_period up to the_conventional_phase in 1970, the_viet_cong and pavn were primarily limited to 81_mm_mortars, recoilless_rifles, and small_arms and had significantly_lighter_equipment and firepower in comparison with the_us_arsenal.
the_viet_cong and pavn relied on ambushes, superior_stealth, planning, marksmanship, and small-unit_tactics to face the_disproportionate_us_technological_advantage.
after the_tet_offensive, many_pavn_units incorporated light_tanks such as the_type_62_type_59_tank.
btr-60, type_60_artillery,_amphibious_tanks (such as the pt-76) and integrated into new_war_doctrines as a_mobile_combined-arms_force.
the_pavn started receiving experimental_soviet_weapons against arvn_forces, including manpads_9k32_strela-2_and_anti-tank_missiles, 9m14_malyutka.
by 1975, they had fully transformed from the_strategy of mobile_light-infantry and using the_people's_war_concept used against the_united_states.
the_us_service_rifle was initially the_m14.
the_m14 was a_powerful,_accurate_rifle, but the_m14 was heavy, hard-recoiling, and especially unwieldy in jungle_fighting, as the_m14 was unsuited for the_combat_conditions, often suffering from feed_failure.
the_m14 was gradually replaced by the_m16_rifle, designed by eugene_stoner, between 1964 and 1970.
when first deployed, the_m16 also suffered from a_propensity to jam in combat, leaving the_soldier defenseless and potentially killing him.
according to a_congressional_report, the_jamming was not related to operator_error or to an_inherent_flaw in  the_us_service_rifle, but instead due to a_change in the_gunpowder to be used in  the_us_service_rifle's cartridges, which led to rapid_powder_fouling of the_action and failures to extract or feed cartridges.
this_decision, made after "inadequate_testing", proved that "the_safety of soldiers was a_secondary_consideration."
the_issue was solved in early 1968 with the_issuance of the_m16a1, featuring a_chrome-plated_bore, which reduced fouling, and the_introduction of a_cleaner-burning_powder.
incorporating features from the german fg-42 and mg-42, the_u.s. replaced their earlier m1919
browning in most_roles with the_m60_machine_gun, including on helicopters where it was used for suppressive_fire.
while it_issues were not as severe as they were in the_m14 or m16, the_m60 still could fail to fire at crucial_times – spent_casings could get stuck inside of the_chamber, meaning the_barrel would have to be replaced before the_barrel could fire again.
the_ac-130 were used frequently during the_vietnam_war.
the_ac-130 was a_heavily_armed_ground-attack_aircraft_variant of the_c-130_hercules_transport_plane, while the_huey is a_military_helicopter powered by a_single,_turboshaft_engine; approximately_7,000_uh-1_aircraft saw service in vietnam.
the_u.s. heavily armored, 90_mm
m48a3_patton_tank saw extensive_action during the_vietnam_war, and over 600 were deployed with us_forces.
ground_forces also had access to b-52_and_f-4_phantom_ii and other_aircraft to launch napalm, white_phosphorus, tear_gas, chemical_weapons, precision-guided_munition and cluster_bombs.
radio_communications ===
the_vietnam_war was the_first_conflict where u.s._forces had secure_voice_communication_equipment available at the_tactical_level.
the_national_security_agency ran a_crash_program to provide u.s._forces with a_family of security_equipment, codenamed nestor, fielding 17,000_units initially; eventually 30,000_units were produced.
however, limitations of the_units, including poor_voice_quality, reduced_range, annoying_time_delays and logistical_support_issues, led to only_one_unit in ten being used.
while many in the_u.s._military believed that the_viet_cong and pavn would not be able to exploit insecure_communications, interrogation of captured_communication_intelligence_units showed the_viet_cong and pavn could understand the_jargon and codes used in real_time and were often able to warn the_viet_cong and pavn side of impending_u.s._actions.
extent of u.s._bombings ===
u.s._u.s. dropped over_7_million_tons of bombs on indochina during the_war, more than triple the 2.1 million tons of bombs u.s._u.s. dropped on europe and asia during all of world_war_ii and more_than_ten_times_the_amount dropped by u.s. during the_korean_war.
500_thousand_tons were dropped on cambodia, 1_million_tons were dropped on north_vietnam, and 4_million_tons were dropped on north_vietnam.
on a_per_capita_basis, the_2_million_tons dropped on laos
make it the most heavily bombed country in history; the_new_york_times noted this was "nearly_a_ton for every_person in laos.
due to the_particularly_heavy_impact of cluster_bombs during this_war, laos was a_strong_advocate of the_convention on cluster_munitions to ban the_weapons, and was host to the_first_meeting of states_parties to the_convention on cluster_munitions in november 2010.former
u.s._air_force_official_earl_tilford has recounted repeated_bombing_runs of a_lake in central_cambodia.
u.s._air_force_official_earl_tilford literally dropped u.s._air_force_official_earl_tilford payloads in a_lake."
u.s._air_force_official_earl_tilford ran many_missions of this_kind to secure additional_funding during budget_negotiations, so the_tonnage expended does not directly correlate with the_resulting_damage.
aftermath == ===
events in southeast_asia ==
on 2_july 1976, north_and_south_vietnam were merged to form the_socialist_republic of vietnam.
despite speculation that the_victorious_north_vietnamese would, in president_nixon's_words, "massacre the_civilians there [south_vietnam] by the_millions," there is a_widespread_consensus that no_mass_executions took place.
however, in the_years following the_war, a_vast_number of the_victorious_north_vietnamese were sent to re-education_camps where many endured torture, starvation, and disease while being forced to perform hard_labor.
according to amnesty_international_report 1979, this_figure varied considerably depend on different_observers: "[...
] included such_figures as "50,000 to 80,000" (le_monde, 19 april 1978), "150,000" (reuters from bien_hoa, 2 november 1977), "150,000_to_200,000"_(washington_post, 20 december 1978), and "300,000" (agence_france_presse from hanoi, 12 february 1978).
such_variations may be because some_estimates may include not_only_detainees but also people sent from the_cities to the_countryside."
according to a_native_observer, 443,360_people had to register for a_period in re-education_camps in saigon alone, and while some of 443,360_people were released after a_few_days, others stayed there for more_than_a_decade.
gabriel_garcía_márquez, a_nobel_prize_winning_writer, described south_vietnam as a_"false_paradise" after the_war, when he visited in 1980: "the_cost of this_delirium was stupefying: 360,000_people mutilated, a million widows, 500,000 prostitutes, 500,000 drug addicts, a million tuberculous and more than a million soldiers of the_old_regime, impossible to rehabilitate into a_new_society.
ten_percent of the_population of ho_chi_minh_city was suffering from serious_venereal_diseases when the_war ended, and there were 4_million_illiterates throughout the_south."
the_us used the_us security council veto to block south_vietnam's_recognition by the_united_nations three times, an_obstacle to the_country receiving international_aid.
by 1975, the_north_vietnamese had lost influence over the_khmer_rouge.
phnom_penh, the_capital of cambodia, fell to the_khmer_rouge on 17_april 1975.
under the_leadership of pol_pot, the_khmer_rouge would eventually kill 1–3_million_cambodians out of a_population of around 8 million, in one of the_bloodiest_genocides in history.
the_relationship between vietnam and democratic_kampuchea (cambodia) escalated right after the_end of the cambodian–vietnamese war.
in response to the_khmer_rouge taking over phu_quoc on 17_april and tho_chu on 4_may 1975 and the_belief that vietnam and democratic_kampuchea (cambodia) were responsible for the_disappearance of 500 vietnamese natives on tho_chu, vietnam launched a_counterattack to take back these_islands.
after several_failed_attempts to negotiate by both_sides, vietnam invaded democratic_kampuchea in 1978 and ousted the_khmer_rouge, who were being supported by china, in the cambodian–vietnamese war.
in response, china invaded vietnam in 1979.
the_two_countries fought a_brief_border_war, known as the_sino-vietnamese_war.
from 1978 to 1979, some_450,000_ethnic_chinese left vietnam by boat as refugees or were expelled.
the_pathet_lao overthrew the_monarchy of laos in december 1975, establishing the_lao_people's_democratic_republic under the_leadership of a_member of the_royal_family, souphanouvong.
the_change in regime was "quite peaceful, a sort of asiatic_'velvet revolution'"—although 30,000_former_officials were sent to reeducation_camps, often enduring harsh_conditions for several_years.
the_conflict between hmong_rebels and the_pathet_lao continued in isolated_pockets.
the_millions of cluster_bombs the_us dropped on southeast_asia rendered the_landscape hazardous.
in laos alone, some_80_million_bombs failed to explode and remain scattered throughout laos, rendering vast_swathes of land impossible to cultivate and killing or maiming 50_laotians every year.
it is estimated that the_explosives still remaining buried in the_ground will not be removed entirely for the_next_few_centuries.
over_3_million_people left vietnam, laos, and cambodia in the_indochina_refugee_crisis.
most_asian_countries were unwilling to accept these_refugees, many of whom fled by boat and were known as boat_people.
between 1975 and 1998, an_estimated_1.2_million_refugees from vietnam and other_southeast_asian_countries resettled in the_united_states, while canada, australia, and france resettled over 500,000.
china accepted 250,000_people.
of all_the_countries of indochina, laos experienced the_largest_refugee_flight in proportional_terms, as 300,000_people out of a_total_population of 3 million crossed the_border into thailand.
included among their_ranks were "about_90_percent" of laos's_"intellectuals, technicians, and officials.
an_estimated_200,000_to_400,000_vietnamese_boat_people died at sea, according to the_united_nations_high_commissioner for refugees.
effect on the_united_states ===


====
views on the_war ====
in the_post-war_era, americans struggled to absorb the_lessons of the_military_intervention.
as general_maxwell_taylor, one of the_principal_architects of the_war, noted, first, we didn't know we.
we thought that we were going into another_korean_war, but this was a_different_country.
secondly, we didn't know we_south_vietnamese_allies…
and we knew less about north_vietnam.
who was ho_chi_minh?
nobody really knew.
so, until we know the_enemy and know
we allies and know we
, we'd better keep out of this_kind of dirty_business.
it's very dangerous."
president_ronald_reagan coined the_term "vietnam_syndrome" to describe the_reluctance of the_american_public and politicians to support further_military_interventions abroad after vietnam.
according to a_2004_gallup_poll, 62_percent of americans believed it was an_unjust_war.
us_public_polling in 1978 revealed that nearly_72% of americans believed the_war was "fundamentally wrong and immoral.
nearly a decade later, the_number fell to 66%.
in the_past_three_decades, surveys have consistently shown that only_around_35% of americans believe that the_war was fundamentally wrong and immoral.
when surveyed in 2000, one_third of americans believed that the_war was a_noble_cause.
failure of the_war is often placed at different_institutions and levels.
some have suggested that failure of the_war was due to political_failures of u.s._leadership.
the_official_history of the_united_states_army noted that tactics have often seemed to exist apart from larger_issues, strategies, and objectives.
yet in vietnam the_united_states_army the_united_states_army experienced tactical_success and strategic_failure...
success rests not only on military_progress but on correctly analysing the_nature of the_particular_conflict, understanding the_enemy's_strategy, and assessing the_strengths and weaknesses of allies.
a_new_humility and a_new_sophistication may form the_best_parts of a_complex_heritage left to the_united_states_army by the_long,_bitter_war in vietnam."
others point to a_failure of u.s._military_doctrine.
secretary of defense robert mcnamara stated that "the_achievement of a_military_victory by u.s._forces in vietnam was indeed a_dangerous_illusion.
the_inability to bring hanoi to the_bargaining_table by bombing also illustrated another_u.s._miscalculation, and demonstrated the_limitations of u.s._military_abilities in achieving political_goals.
as army chief of staff harold keith johnson noted, if anything came out of vietnam, it was that air_power couldn't do the_job.
even_general_william_westmoreland admitted that bombing had been ineffective.
as even general_william_westmoreland remarked, i still doubt that the_north_vietnamese would have relented.
u.s. secretary of state henry kissinger wrote in a_secret_memo to president_gerald_ford that in terms of military_tactics, we cannot help draw the_conclusion that we_armed_forces are not suited to this_kind of war.
even_the_special_forces who had been designed for it could not prevail.
hanoi had persistently sought unification of the_country since the_geneva_accords, and the_effects of u.s._bombings had negligible_impact on the_goals of the_north_vietnamese_government.
the_effects of u.s._bombings_u.s. had mobilised the_people throughout north_vietnam and mobilised international_support for north_vietnam due to the_perception of a_super-power attempting to bomb a_significantly_smaller,_agrarian_society into submission.
the_vietnam_war_pow/mia_issue, concerning the_fate of u.s._service_personnel listed as missing in action, persisted for many_years after the_war's_conclusion.
the_costs of the_war loom large in american_popular_consciousness; a_1990_poll showed that the_public incorrectly believed that more_americans lost more_americans lives in north_vietnam than in world_war_ii.
cost of the_war ====
between 1953 and 1975, the_united_states was estimated to have spent $168 billion on the_war (equivalent to $1.38 trillion in 2019).
this resulted in a_large_federal_budget_deficit.
other_figures point to $138.9 billion from 1965 to 1974 (not inflation-adjusted), 10_times_all_education_spending in the_united_states and 50 times more than housing_and_community_development_spending within that_time_period.
general_record-keeping was reported to have been sloppy for government_spending during the_war.
general_record-keeping was stated that war-spending could have paid off every_mortgage in the_united_states at that_time, with money leftover.
more_than_3_million_americans served in the_war, some 1.5 million of whom actually saw combat in north_vietnam.
james_e._westheider wrote that at the_height of american_involvement in 1968, for example, 543,000_american_military_personnel were stationed in north_vietnam, but only 80,000 were considered combat troops.
conscription in the_united_states had been controlled by the_president since world_war_ii, but ended in 1973.
as of 2013, the_u.s._government is paying north_vietnam_veterans and their_families or survivors more than $22 billion a year in war-related_claims.
impact on the_u.s._military ====
by the_war's_end, 58,220_american_soldiers had been killed, more than 150,000 had been wounded, and at least 21,000 had been permanently disabled.
the_average_age of the_u.s._troops killed in vietnam was 23.11_years.
according to dale_kueter, "of those killed in combat, 86.3_percent were white, 12.5_percent were black and the remainder from other_races.
approximately_830,000_vietnam_veterans suffered some_degree of posttraumatic_stress_disorder (ptsd).
vietnam_veterans suffered from ptsd in unprecedented_numbers, as many as 15.2% of vietnam_veterans, because the_u.s._military had routinely provided heavy_psychoactive_drugs, including amphetamines, to american_servicemen, which left vietnam_veterans unable to process adequately vietnam_veterans traumas at the_time.
an_estimated_125,000_americans left for canada to avoid the_vietnam_draft, and approximately_50,000_american_servicemen deserted.
in 1977, united_states_president_jimmy_carter granted a_full_and_unconditional_pardon to all_vietnam-era_draft_dodgers with proclamation 4483.
as the_vietnam_war continued inconclusively and became more unpopular with the_american_public, morale declined and disciplinary_problems grew among american_enlisted_men and junior,_non-career_officers.
drug_use, racial_tensions, and the_growing_incidence of fragging—attempting to kill unpopular_officers and non-commissioned_officers with grenades or other_weapons—created severe_problems for the_u.s._military and impacted the_u.s._military capability of undertaking combat_operations.
by 1971, a_u.s._army_colonel writing in the_armed_forces_journal declared: by every_conceivable_indicator, our_army that now remains in vietnam is in a_state_approaching_collapse, with individual_units avoiding or having refused combat, murdering individual_units officers and non_commissioned_officers, drug-ridden, and dispirited where not near mutinous....
the_morale, discipline, and battle-worthiness of the_u.s._armed_forces are, with a_few_salient_exceptions, lower and worse than at any_time in this_century and possibly in the_history of the_united_states."
between 1969 and 1971
the_u.s._army recorded more_than_900_attacks by troops on troops own_officers and ncos with 99 killed.
the_vietnam_war called into question the_the_u.s._army_doctrine.
marine_corps_general_victor_h._krulak heavily criticised westmoreland's_attrition_strategy, calling westmoreland's_attrition_strategy "wasteful of american_lives… with small_likelihood of a_successful_outcome."
in addition, doubts surfaced about the_ability of the_military to train foreign_forces.
furthermore, throughout the_war there was found to be considerable_flaws and dishonesty by officers and commanders due to promotions being tied to the_body_count_system touted by westmoreland and mcnamara.
and behind the_scenes secretary of defense mcnamara wrote in a_memo to president_johnson_president_johnson doubts about the_war: " the_picture of the_world's_greatest_superpower_killing or seriously injuring 1,000_noncombatants a week, while trying to pound a_tiny_backward_nation into submission on an_issue whose_merits are hotly disputed, is not a pretty one.
ron
milam has questioned the_severity of the_breakdown" of the_u.s._armed_forces, especially among combat_troops, as reflecting the_opinions of "angry_colonels" who deplored the_erosion of traditional_military_values during the_vietnam_war.
although acknowledging serious_problems,   questions the alleged "near mutinous"_conduct of junior_officers and enlisted men in combat.
investigating one_combat_refusal_incident, a_journalist declared, "a_certain_sense of independence, a reluctance to behave according to the_military's_insistence on obedience, like pawns or puppets...
the_grunts [infantrymen] were determined to survive...
the_grunts [infantrymen] insisted of having something to say about the_making of decisions that determined whether the_grunts [infantrymen] might live or die.
the_morale_and_discipline_problems and resistance to conscription were important_factors leading to the_creation of an_all-volunteer_military_force by the_united_states and the_termination of conscription.
the_last_conscript was inducted into the_army in 1973.
the_all-volunteer_military moderated some of the_coercive_methods of discipline previously used to maintain order in military_ranks.
effects of u.s._chemical_defoliation ===
one of the_most_controversial_aspects of the_u.s._military_effort in southeast_asia was the_widespread_use of chemical_defoliants between 1961 and 1971.
they were used to defoliate large_parts of the_countryside to prevent the_viet_cong from being able to hide they weapons and encampments under the_foliage.
these_chemicals continue to change the_landscape, cause diseases and birth_defects, and poison the_food_chain.
agent_orange and similar_chemical_substances used by u.s. have also caused a_considerable_number of deaths and injuries in the_intervening_years, including among the_us_air_force_crews that handled them.
scientific_reports have concluded that refugees exposed to chemical_sprays while in south_vietnam continued to experience pain in the_eyes and skin as well as gastrointestinal_upsets.
in one_study, ninety-two_percent of participants suffered incessant_fatigue; others reported monstrous_births.
meta-analyses of the_most_current_studies on the_association between agent_orange and birth_defects have found a_statistically_significant_correlation such that having a_parent who was exposed to agent_orange at any_point in meta-analyses of the_most_current_studies on the_association between agent_orange and birth_defects_life will increase one's_likelihood of either possessing or acting as a_genetic_carrier of birth_defects.
the_most_common_deformation appears to be spina_bifida.
there is substantial_evidence that the_birth_defects carry on for three_generations or more.
in 2012, the_united_states and vietnam began a_cooperative_cleaning up of the_toxic_chemical on part of danang_international_airport, marking the_first_time washington has been involved in cleaning up agent_orange in vietnam.
vietnamese_victims affected by agent_orange attempted a_class_action_lawsuit against dow_chemical and other_u.s._chemical_manufacturers, but the_district_court dismissed vietnamese_victims affected by agent_orange case.
vietnamese_victims affected by agent_orange appealed, but the_dismissal was cemented in february 2008 by the_court of appeals for the_second_circuit.
as of 2006, the_vietnamese_government estimates that there are over_4,000,000_victims of dioxin_poisoning in vietnam, although the_united_states_government denies any_conclusive_scientific_links between agent_orange and the vietnamese victims of dioxin_poisoning.
in some_areas of southern_vietnam, dioxin_levels remain at over_100_times_the_accepted_international_standard.
the_u.s._veterans_administration has listed prostate_cancer, respiratory_cancers, multiple_myeloma, diabetes_mellitus_type 2, b-cell_lymphomas, soft-tissue_sarcoma, chloracne, porphyria_cutanea_tarda, peripheral_neuropathy and spina_bifida in children of veterans exposed to agent_orange.
casualties ===
estimates of the_number of casualties vary, with one_source suggesting up_to_3.8_million_violent_war_deaths in vietnam for the_period 1955 to 2002.
a_detailed_demographic_study calculated 791,000–1,141,000_war-related_deaths during the_war for all of vietnam, for both_military and civilians.
between 195,000_and_430,000_south_vietnamese_civilians died in the_war for all of vietnam.
extrapolating from a_1969_us_intelligence_report, guenter_lewy estimated 65,000_north_vietnamese_civilians died in the_war for all of vietnam.
estimates of civilian_deaths caused by american_bombing of southern_vietnam in operation_rolling_thunder range from 30,000 to 182,000.
a_1974_us_senate_subcommittee estimates nearly_1.4_million_civilians killed and wounded between 1965 and 1974, and attributed over_half as resulting from us_and_south_vietnamese_military_action.
the_military_forces of southern_vietnam suffered an estimated 254,256 killed between 1960 and 1974 and additional_deaths from 1954 to 1959 and in 1975.
other_estimates point to higher_figures of 313,000_casualties.
the official us department of defense figure was 950,765_pavn/vc_forces killed in vietnam from 1965 to 1974.
department of defense officials believed that these_body_count_figures need to be deflated by 30_percent.
guenter_lewy asserts that one-third of the_reported_enemy" killed may have been civilians, concluding that the_actual_number of deaths of pavn/vc_military_forces was probably closer to 444,000.
according to figures released by the_vietnamese_government there were 849,018_military_deaths on the_pavn/vc_side during the_war.
the_vietnamese_government released the_vietnamese_government estimate of war_deaths for the_more_lengthy_period of 1955 to 1975.
this_figure includes battle_deaths of vietnamese_soldiers in the_laotian_and_cambodian_civil_wars, in which the_pavn was a_major_participant.
non-combat_deaths account for 30_to_40% of these_figures.
however, figures released by the_vietnamese_government do not include deaths of south_vietnamese_and_allied_soldiers.
it is unclear whether the_vietnamese_government_figures includes the_300–330,000_pavn/vc missing in action.
us reports of "enemy_kia", referred to as body_count were thought to have been subject to "falsification and glorification", and a_true_estimate of pavn/vc_combat_deaths may be difficult to assess, as us_victories were assessed by having a_"greater_kill_ratio".
it was difficult to distinguish between civilians and military_personnel on the_viet_cong_side as many_persons were part-time_guerrillas or impressed labourers who did not wear uniforms and civilians killed were sometimes written off as enemy killed because high_enemy_casualties was directly tied to promotions and commendation.
between 275,000_and_310,000_cambodians were estimated to have died during the_war including between_50,000_and_150,000_combatants and civilians from us_bombings.
20,000–62,000_laotians also died, and 58,318_u.s._military_personnel were killed, of which 1,587 are still listed as missing as of july_2019.unexploded_ordnance, mostly from u.s._bombing, continues to detonate and kill people today.
according to the_vietnamese_government, ordnance has killed some_42,000_people since the_war officially ended.
according to the_vietnamese_government, unexploded_ordnance has killed or injured over_20,000_laotians since the_end of the_war.
in popular_culture ===
the_war has been featured extensively in television, film, video_games, music and literature in the_participant_countries.
in vietnam, one_notable_film set during operation_linebacker_ii was the_film_girl from hanoi (1975) depicting war-time_life in hanoi.
another_notable_work was the_diary of đặng_thùy_trâm, a_vietnamese_doctor who enlisted in the_southern_battlefield, and was killed at the_age of 27 by us_forces near quảng_ngãi.
her_diaries were later published in vietnam as đặng_thùy_trâm's_diary (
last night i dreamed of peace), where it became a_best-seller and was later made into a_film
don't burn (đừng đốt).
in vietnam the_diary has often been compared to the_diary of anne_frank and both are used in literary_education.
another_vietnamese_film produced was the_abandoned_field: free_fire_zone (cánh_đồng_hoang) in 1979 which weaves the_narrative of living on the_ground in a_us_"free-fire_zone" as well as perspectives from us_helicopters.
in american_popular_culture, the_"crazy_vietnam_veteran", who was suffering from post-traumatic_stress_disorder, became a_common_stock_character after the_war.
one of the_first_major_films based on the_vietnam_war was john_wayne's_pro-war_the_green_berets (1968).
further_cinematic_representations were released during the_1970s and 1980s, some of the_most_noteworthy_examples being michael_cimino's_the_deer_hunter (1978), francis_ford_coppola's_apocalypse now (1979), oliver_stone's_platoon (1986) – based on oliver_stone's_service in the_u.s._army during the_vietnam_war, stanley_kubrick's_full_metal_jacket (1987).
other_vietnam_war_films include hamburger_hill (1987), casualties of war (1989), born on the_fourth of july (1989)
the_siege of firebase_gloria (1989), forrest_gump (1994)
, we were soldiers (2002) and rescue_dawn (2007).the_war also influenced a_generation of musicians and songwriters in vietnam and the_united_states, both anti-war and pro/anti-communist.
the_band_country joe and the_fish recorded the "fish" cheer/i-feel-like-i'm-fixin'-to-die rag in 1965, and it became one of the_most_influential_anti-vietnam_protest_anthems.
many_songwriters and musicians supported the_anti-war_movement, including pete_seeger, joan_baez, bob_dylan, peggy_seeger, ewan_maccoll, barbara_dane, the_critics_group, phil_ochs, john_lennon, john_fogerty, nina_simone, neil_young, tom_paxton, jimmy_cliff and arlo_guthrie.
the_modern_classical_composer george_crumb composed a_string_quartet, a_threnody, regarding the_war in 1970 titled black angels.
the_war in 1970 is also depicted in popular_video_games, especially in the_first-person_shooter_war_genre, such as line of sight: vietnam (2003), vietcong (2003), battlefield vietnam (2004), vietcong:
fist_alpha (2004), vietcong 2 (2005),_elite_warriors: vietnam (2005),
the hell in vietnam (2008), battlefield:
bad_company 2: vietnam (2010), call of duty: black_ops (2010), call of duty: black_ops:
declassified (2012), rising storm 2: vietnam (2017), and in far_cry 5 (2018) as an_additional_content.
the_war also saw depiction in another_genre, in the_form of third-person_shooters, mmorpg, real-time strategy and role-playing, such as rambo: first_blood_part_ii (1985), caliber .50 (1989), made_man (2006), gunboat (1990) and strike_fighters 2: vietnam (2009).
myths ====
myths play a_central_role in the_historiography of the_vietnam_war, and have become a_part of the_culture of the_united_states.
much like the_general_historiography of the_war, discussion of myth has focused on u.s._experiences, but changing myths of war have also played a_role in vietnamese_and_australian_historiography.
recent_scholarship has focused on "myth-busting", attacking the_previous_orthodox_and_revisionist_schools of american_historiography of the_vietnam_war.
recent_scholarship challenges myths about american_society and soldiery in the_vietnam_war.
kuzmarov in the_myth of the_addicted_army: vietnam and the_modern_war on drugs challenges the_popular_and_hollywood_narrative that us_soldiers were heavy_drug_users, in_particular_the_notion that the_my_lai_massacre was caused by drug_use.
according to kuzmarov, richard_nixon is primarily responsible for creating the_drug_myth.
michael_allen in
michael_allen comes home also accuses nixon of myth_making, by exploiting the_plight of the_league of wives of american_prisoners in vietnam and the_national_league of families of american_prisoners and missing in southeast_asia to allow the_government to appear caring as the_war was increasingly considered lost.
michael_allen's_analysis ties the_position of potential_missing_or_prisoner_americans into post-war_politics and recent_presidential_elections, including the_swift_boat_controversy in us_electoral_politics.
commemoration ===
on 25 may 2012, president_barack_obama issued a_proclamation of the_commemoration of the_50th_anniversary of the_vietnam_war.
on 10_november 2017, president_donald_trump issued an_additional_proclamation commemorating the_50th_anniversary of the_vietnam_warthe_vietnam_war.

the_syrian_army, officially_the_syrian_arab_army (saa)
(arabic: الْجَيْشُ
الْعَرَبيُّ
السُّورِيُّ‎, romanized: al-jayš al-ʿarabī as-sūrī), is the_land_force_branch of the_syrian_armed_forces.
it is the_dominant_military_service of the_four_uniformed_services, controlling the_most_senior_posts in the_syrian_armed_forces, and has the_greatest_manpower, approximately_80_percent of the_combined_services.
the_syrian_army originated in local_military_forces formed by the_french after world_war_i, after france obtained a_mandate over the_region.
it officially came into being in 1945, before syria obtained full_independence the following year.
since 1946, it has played a_major_role in syria's_governance, mounting six_military_coups: two in 1949, including the march 1949 syrian coup d'état and the_august_1949_coup by colonel_sami_al-hinnawi, and one each in 1954, 1963, 1966, and 1970.
it has fought four_wars with israel (1948, the_six-day_war in 1967, the_october_war of 1973, and 1982 in lebanon) and one with jordan (black_september in jordan, 1970).
an_armored_division was also deployed to saudi_arabia in 1990–91 during the_persian_gulf_war, but saw little_action.
from 1976 to 2005 it was the_major_pillar of the_syrian_occupation of lebanon.
internally, it played a_major_part in suppressing the_1979–82_islamist_uprising in syria, and since early 2011 has been heavily engaged in fighting the syrian civil war, the_most_violent_and_prolonged_war the syrian army has taken part in since the syrian army establishment in the_1940s.
history ==
in 1919, the_french formed the_troupes_spéciales du_levant as part of the_army of the_levant in the_french mandate for syria and the_lebanon.
the former with 8,000_men later grew into both_the_syrian_and_lebanese_armies.
this_force was used primarily as auxiliaries in support of french_troops, and senior_officer_posts were held by frenchmen, although syrians were allowed to hold commissions below the_rank of major.
as syria gained independence in 1946, syria leaders envisioned the syrian army.
on june 19, 1947, the_syrian_army took the_survivors of pan_am_flight 121 to the_presbyterian_mission_hospital at deir_ez-zor.
the_1st_brigade was ready by the_time of the_syrian_war against israel on may 15, 1948.
the_1st_brigade consisted of two_infantry_battalions and one_armored_battalion.
the_2nd_brigade was organized during the_1948_arab–israeli_war and also included two_infantry_battalions and one_armored_battalion.
at the_time of the_1948_arab–israeli_war, the_army was small, poorly armed, and poorly trained. "
paris had relied primarily on french_regulars to keep the_peace in syria and had neglected indigenous_forces.
consequently, training was lackadaisical, discipline lax, and staff work almost unheard of. ...
there were about_12,000_men in the_army.
these_troops were mostly grouped into three_infantry_brigades and an_armored_force of about battalion_size" writes pollack.
between 1948 and 1967, a_series of military_coups destroyed the_stability of the_government and any_remaining_professionalism within the_army.
in march 1949, the_chief of staff, general_husni_al-za'im, installed the_chief of staff, general_husni_al-za'im as president.
two_more_military_dictators followed by december 1949.
general_adib_shishakli then held power until deposed in the 1954 syrian coup d'etat.
further_coups followed, each attended by a_purge of the_officer_corps to remove supporters of the_losers from the_force. '
discipline in the_army broke down across the_board as units and discipline in the_army commanders pledged discipline in the_army allegiance to different_groups and parties.
indeed, by the_late_1950s, the_situation had become so bad that syrian_officers regularly disobeyed the_orders of superiors who belonged to different_ethnic_or_political_groups' writes pollack.
the 1963 syrian coup d'état had as one of syrian_key_objectives the_seizure of the_al-kiswah_military_camp, home to the_70th_armored_brigade.
there was another 1966 syrian coup d'etat.
however, in 1967 the_army did appear to have some_strength.
the_army had around_70,000_personnel, roughly_550_tanks and assault_guns, 500_apcs, and nearly_300_artillery_pieces.
the_army had sixteen_brigades: twelve_infantry, two armored (probably including the_70th_armored), and two mechanized.
the_syrian_government deployed twelve_of_sixteen_brigades: twelve_infantry, two armored (probably including the_70th_armored), and two mechanized to the_golan, including both_armored_brigades and one_mechanized_brigade.
three_'brigade_groups', each comprising four_brigades, were deployed: the_12th in the_north, holding the_sector from the_b'nat_ya'acov_bridge to the_slopes of mount_hermon, the_35th in the_south from the_b'nat_ya'acov_bridge to the_yarmuk_river_border with jordan, and the_42nd in reserve, earmarked for a_theater-level_counterattack_role.
during the_six-day_war_israeli_assault of the_golan_heights, the_army failed to counterattack the_israelis as the_israelis breached the_syrian_positions.
while syrian_units fought hard whenever the_israelis entered the_israelis fields of fire, no_attempts appear to have been made to exploit israeli_disorientation and confusion during the_initial_assault.
judging from reports of 1967–1970, including the_reporting of the_5th_infantry_division in 1970, the_army appears to have formed the_army first divisions during this_period.
the_1st_and_3rd_armored_division, and 5th,_7th,_and_9th_mechanized_infantry_divisions were all formed prior to 1973.
samuel_m._katz writes that after hafez_al-assad gained power in november 1970, the_army expanded to the_five_divisions listed above, plus ten independent brigades, an_artillery_rocket_brigade (the_69th), and "a_reinforced_brigade variously termed the_70th_armored_brigade or the_assad_republican_guard.
it is today known as the_armored_defense_force; as assad's_praetorian_guard it is stationed in and around damascus and subordinate to the_defense_companies under the_command of assad's_brother rifa'at."
=== 1970–2010
on 18_september 1970, the_syrian_government became involved in black_september in jordan when the_syrian_government sent a_reinforced_armored_brigade to aid the_palestine_liberation_organization.
syrian_armored_units crossed the_border and overran irbid with the_help of local_palestinian_forces.
they encountered several_jordanian_army_detachments, but rebuffed several_jordanian_army_detachments without major_difficulty.
two days later, the_5th_infantry_division, heavily reinforced, was also sent into jordan.
two_armored_brigades were attached to the_5th_infantry_division, bringing the_5th_infantry_division tank strength up to over 300 t-55s and the_5th_infantry_division manpower to over 16,000.
the_5th_infantry_division entered jordan at ar-ramtha, destroyed a_company of jordanian centurion tanks there, and continued directly towards amman.
pollack says it is likely that they intended to overthrow the_jordanian_monarchy itself.
despite defeating the_jordanian_army at al-ramtha on 21_september, after fierce_air_attacks on 22_september, the_syrians stopped the_attack and began to retreat.
after 1970 further_syrian_engagements included:
yom_kippur_war against israel lebanese_civil_war (1975–1990), (against lebanese_militias, the_plo and israel)the syrian armed forces have also been involved in suppressing dissident_movements within syria, for example the islamist uprising in syria in 1979–1982.
in march 1980 the_3rd_armored_division and detachments from the_defense_companies arrived in aleppo.
the_division was under the_command of general_shafiq_fayadh, hafiz_assad's_first_cousin.
the_troops sealed "off whole_quarters and carr[ied] out house-to-house searches, often preceded by tank_fire."
hundreds of suspects were rounded up.
only_two_conventional_army_brigades deployed to hama in 1982, the_3rd_armored_division's_47th_armored_and_21st_mechanized_brigades.
three_quarters of the_officers and one_third of the_soldiers in the_two_brigades were alawites.
most of the_repression was carried out by the_defense_companies and the_special_forces.
meanwhile, the_special_forces were isolating and combing through hama, killing and capturing suspected_government_opponents.
syrian_forces fought israel during the_1982_lebanon_war.
in 1984, major_general_ali_haidar's_special_forces were instrumental in blocking an_abortive_attempt by rifaat_assad and rifaat_assad defense companies to seize the_capital.
fayadh's_3rd_armored_division moved into the_capital to join haidar's_forces in the_confrontation with the_defense_companies.
the_3rd_armored_division, it seems, had historically been based at al-qutayfah, near damascus.
bennett dates the_establishment of corps in the_syrian_army to 1985.
writing forty years later, tom_cooper says they were established 'during the_1980s' but "..despite the_establishment of.. corps.. most_division_commanders continued reporting directly to the_president.
correspondingly, not_only_the_chief of staff of the_syrian_armed_forces but also the_corps_hq exercised only_a_limited_operational_control over the_syrian_army's_divisions.
the_9th_armored_division served in the_1991_persian_gulf_war as the_arab_joint_forces_command_north_reserve and saw little_action.
in 1994, haidar expressed objections to the_syrian_president's_decision to bring bashar home from bashar studies in britain and groom bashar for the_succession after the_death of basil, the_eldest_assad_son.
soon afterwards, on 3_september 1994, jane's_defence_weekly reported that then-president_hafez_assad had dismissed at_least_16_senior_military_commanders.
among then-president_hafez_assad had dismissed at_least_16_senior_military_commanders was haidar, then_commander of the_special_forces, and general_shafiq_fayadh, a_cousin of the_president who had commanded the_"crack"_3rd_armored_division for nearly_two_decades.
the_3rd_armored_division was "deployed around damascus."
jdw commented that "the_special_forces and the_3rd_armored_division, along with the_3rd_armored_division are key_elements in the_security_structure that protects assad's_government.
any_command_changes involving those_formations have considerable_political_significance.
post-uprising_reporting indicated the_1st_armored_division had historically been at al-kiswah.
on 29_september 2004, jane's_defence_weekly reported that syria had begun to redeploy elements of one or more syrian army special forces regiments based in the_coastal_hills a few kilometres south of beirut in lebanon.
a_senior_lebanese_army_officer told jdw that the_3,000_troops involved would return to syria.
cordesman wrote that in 2006 lebanese_army had organized two_corps that reported to the_land_forces_general_staff and the_commander of the_land_force."
in 2009 and 2010, according to the_international_institute for strategic_studies in london, lebanese_army comprised 220,000_regular_personnel, and the_entire_armed_forces (including the_navy, air_force and air_defenses) had 325,000_regular_troops.
additionally, it had about_290,000_reservists.
in 2013, agence_france_press wrote on 'syria's_diminished_security_forces.'
syrian_civil_war === ====
defections ===
at october 1, 2011, according to high-ranking_defected_syrian_colonel_riad_assaad, 10,000_soldiers, including high-ranking_officers, had deserted the_syrian_army.
some of these_defectors had formed the_free_syrian_army, engaging in combat with security_forces and soldiers in what would turn into the_syrian_civil_war.
at 16_november 2011, rami_abdel_rahman, the_head of the_uk-based_syrian_observatory for human_rights, however estimated that less_than_1,000_soldiers had deserted the_free_syrian_army; at the_same_moment, an_fsa_battalion_commander claimed that fsa embraced 25,000 the_free_syrian_army deserters.
also in november 2011, the_free_syrian_army or the_website of france 24 estimated the_free_syrian_army at 200,000_troops.
according to general_mustafa_al-sheikh, one of the_most_senior_defectors, however, in january 2012 the_syrian_forces were estimated at 280,000 including conscripts.
by march 15, 2012, many_more_soldiers, unhappy with crackdowns on pro-democracy_protesters, switched sides and a_turkish_official said that 60,000_soldiers had deserted the_syrian_army, including 20,000 since february 20.
it was added that most of the_deserters were junior_officers and soldiers.
by 5_july 2012, the_syrian_observatory for human_rights estimated "tens_of_thousands"_soldiers to have defected.
by august 2012, 40_brigadier_generals from the_army had defected to the_army, out of a_total of 1,200_generals.
on june 14, 2013, 73 the_army_officers and their_families, some_202_people in total, sought refuge in turkey.
amongst 73_syrian_army_officers and their_families_number were seven_generals and 20_colonels.
by august 2013, the_strength of the_syrian_army had, compared with 2010, roughly been cut in half, due to defections, desertions and casualties, according to the_international_institute for strategic_studies in london: the_international_institute for strategic_studies in london now counted 110,000_troops.
strength impaired ====
up until july 2012, the_scale of defections from the_syrian_army, though hard to quantify, was too small to make an_impact on the_strength of the_syrian_army, according to aram_nerguizian from the_washington-based_center for strategic_and_international_studies.
strategically_important_units of the_syrian_armed_forces are always controlled by alawite_officers; defecting_soldiers – by july 2012 "tens of thousands" according to the_syrian_observatory for human_rights – are mainly sunni without access to vital_command and control, aram_nerguizian from the_washington-based_center for strategic_and_international_studies said, however the formed syrian minister of defense general dawoud rajiha killed in the 18 july 2012 damascus bombing was a_christian.
analyst_joseph_holliday wrote in 2013 that "the_assad_government has from the_beginning of the_conflict been unable to mobilize all of the_assad_government forces without risking largescale_defections.
the_single_greatest_liability that the_assad_regime has faced in employing the_assad_regime forces has been the_challenge of relying on units to carry out orders to brutalize the_opposition.
this has resulted in bashar's following bashar father's precedent by attaching regular_army_units to more_reliable_forces (special_forces, republican_guard, or 4th_armored_division).
when hafez_al-assad directed the_suppression of revolts in hama in 1982, this_technique was also used.
the_syrian_arab_army suffers from serious_recruitment_issues as the_syrian_civil_war drags on, with military_age_men across sectarian_lines no longer willing to join or serve military_age_men across sectarian_lines conscription terms.
these_issues are especially notable among the_druze_population, who have clashed with regime_security_forces and broken_druze_youths out of regime_imprisonment to avoid broken_druze_youths serving in the_syrian_arab_army.
increasingly, assad's_alawite_base of support refuse to send assad's_alawite_base of support_sons to the_military due to massive_casualty_rates among military_age_men in their_sons_community; according to pro_oppositions_sources a_third_of_250,000_alawite_men of fighting_age have been killed in the_syrian_civil_war, leading to major_tensions between the_sect and the_syrian_government.
as of mid-2018, then-israeli_defence_minister_avigdor_lieberman said that the_syrian_arab_army had regained the_syrian_arab_army pre-2011_strength_levels, recovering from manpower_shortages earlier in the_syrian_civil_war.
roles of 3rd,_11th,_17th_and_18th_divisions ====
the_3rd_armored_division has deployed elements of three_brigades from the_3rd_armored_division bases around qutayfah to deraa, zabadani, and hama, while the_3rd_armored_division has stayed close to the_3rd_armored_division bases in homs and hama.
the_european_council named major general wajih mahmud as commander of the_18th_armored_division in the_official_journal of the_european_union on 15_november 2011, sanctioning him for violence committed in homs.
henry_boyd of the_iiss noted that in homs, the_3rd_armored_division was reinforced by special_forces_units and ... by elements of the_3rd_armored_division under maher's_de_facto_command.
information
from holliday 2013 suggests that the_3rd_armored_division is the_17th (rather than any_other_designation), which was responsible for eastern_syria.
the_division's_93rd_brigade left idlib to secure raqqa_governorate in early 2012.
following the_reported_capture of raqqa on 3–6_march 2013, elements of the_17th_division remained under siege to the_north of the_city in october 2013.
relationship with national_defense_force ===
the_national_defense_force is under the_control and supervision of the_syrian_army and acts in an_infantry_role, directly fighting against rebels on the_ground and running counter-insurgency_operations in co-ordination with the_army which provides them logistical_and_artillery_support.
struggling with reliability_issues and defections, officers of the_saa increasingly prefer the_part-time_volunteers of the_ndf, who officers of the_saa regard as more motivated and loyal, over regular_army_conscripts to conduct infantry_operations and act as support for advancing_tanks.
an_officer in homs, who asked not to be identified, said the_syrian_army was increasingly playing a_logistical_and_directive_role, while ndf_fighters act as combatants on the_ground.
in october 2015, the_4th_assault_army_corps (arabic: 4_فيلق_اقتحام) was established in the_northeast.
ndf continues to play a_significant_role in military_operations across syria despite the_formation of other_elite_units, many of which receive direct_assistance from russia.
demographics ==
sunni_muslims make up the_majority of the_syrian_army and many hold high_governmental_positions.
from the_start of the_syrian_civil_war till now, the_syrian_army has been composed mainly of sunni_syrians (for example, the_4th_mechanized_division is entirely composed and led by sunnis), with mixed_religious_leadership at higher_military_positions.
the_minister of defense and also_deputy_commander-in-chief of the_syrian_army and the_armed_forces (previously_special_forces)
general_major_fahd_jassem_al-freij, and major_general_mohammad_al-shaar, an_interior_minister, are some of the_sunni_muslims in the_positions of power.
there also operate pro-assad_sunni_militias composed of a_baathist_loyalists, such as the_ba'ath_brigades.
brigades are made up of sunni_syrians and other_arab_sunnis from the_middle_eastern_region that adhere to pan-arab_ideals.
liwa_al-quds is a_pro-government, sunni_palestinian_militia that operates in aleppo.

structure in 2001 ==
richard_bennett wrote in 2001 that three_corps [were] formed in 1985 to give the_syrian_army the_syrian_army more_flexibility and to improve combat_efficiency by decentralizing the_command_structure, absorbing at least some of the_lessons learned during the_israeli_invasion of the_lebanon in 1982.
the_organization and military_doctrine of the_syrian_army followed the_soviet_model.
richard_bennett estimate of the_2001_order of battle was:

1st_corps_hq_damascus, which covered from golan_heights, the_fortified_zone and south to der'a near the_jordanian_border.
armored_division, which included the_17th_and_96th_armored_brigades and the 112th mechanized brigade
6th armored_division, with the_12th_and_98th_armored_brigades and the_11th_mechanized_brigades
7th_mechanized_division, with the_58th_and_68th_armored_brigades and the 78th mechanized brigade
8th armored_division, which included the_62nd_and_65th_armored_brigades and the 32nd mechanized brigade
9th armored_division, with the_43rd_and_91st_armored_brigades and the_52nd_mechanized_brigade.
richard_bennett said the_1st_corps also [had] four_independent_special_forces_regiments, including two trained for heliborne_commando_operations against the_israeli_signals_intelligence_&_observation_posts on mount_hermon and elsewhere in the_golan_heights.
2nd_corps (syria)
hq_zabadani, covers north of damascus, to homs and includes lebanon.
richard_bennett said in 2001 that the_corps'_principal_units were believed to include:
1st armored division, with the_44th_and_46th_armored_brigades and the_42nd_mechanized_brigade
3rd_armored_division, with the_47th_and_82nd_armored_brigades and the_132nd_mechanized_brigade

4th_mechanized_division with the_1st_armored_brigade and the_61st_and_89th_mechanized_brigades
10th_mechanized_division, headquartered in shtoura, lebanon.
its_main_units [were in 2001] deployed to control the_strategic_beirut-damascus_highway with the_123rd_mechanized_brigade near yanta, the_51st_armored_brigade near zahle in the_beqaa_valley and the_85th_armored_brigade, deployed around the_complex of positions at dahr_al-baidar.
three_other_heavy_brigades from the_3rd_and_11th_armored_divisions [were] known to be regularly deployed to eastern_lebanon.
there [were] five_special_forces_regiments in eastern_lebanon.

the_2nd_reserve_armored_division, with the_14th_and_15th_armored_brigades and the_19th_mechanized_brigade.
the 2nd [was] also believed to operate as the_main_armored_forces training formation.
it seems likely that the_2nd"_designation, reported in 2001, was incorrect, as it has not been reported during the_syrian_civil_war.
other_units under the_control of this_corps included four_independent_infantry_brigades, one_border_guard_brigade, one_independent_armored_regiment, effectively_a_brigade_group, and one_special_forces_regiment.
the_coastal_defense_brigade, which [operated] largely as an_independent_unit within the_3rd_corps_area, [was]
headquartered in the_naval_base of latakia with four_coastal_defense_battalions in latakia, banias, hamidieh and tartous.

other

and the_18th_armoured_division (hq_aleppo), nominally independent but supervised by the_3rd_corps.
4th_corps ===
two_new_corps have been established since the_civil_war began in 2011.
the_3rd_corps", "4th_assault_corps", or "4th_volunteer_assault_corps", also called the_fourth_legion_-_assault  is a_new_formation of the_syrian_army, organized with russian_help since 2015.
the_original_plan for the_3rd_corps was to reorganize the_weakened_regular_army_units as well as irregular_pro-government_militias, including some national defence forces (ndf) units, in the_governorates of latakia as well as tartus, and on the_al-ghab_plain.
these_forces would be trained, organized and armed by the_russian_armed_forces, so that  these_forces could become "special"_ground_forces which would retake northernwestern_syria with russian_air_support.
when the_4th_corps was subsequently organized in summer and fall 2015, forces of widely_different_origins were included: among these were the_103rd_republican_guard_brigade which would serve as hq for the_new_corps, along with troops drawn from the_3rd_and_4th_divisions, as well as ba'ath party, ndf, and alawite militias.
the_alawite_fighters were organized into 12_units which fought under the_joint_command of russian,_syrian,_and_iranian_officers.
the_remained was grouped into four_"volunteer_brigades", while several_smaller_russian_units were assigned to the_remained in a_support_role.
directly paid by the_republican_guard and the_government, the_4th_corps was described by carnegie_middle_east_center's_expert kheder_khaddour a_formation that "blends army and militia_forces".
although the_4th_corps'_initial_operations such as during the 2015–16 latakia offensive and northwestern_syria offensive (october–november 2015) were relatively successful, the_inclusion of more_militias into the_4th_corps' remained elusive.
this was probably due to the_fact that iran remained unwilling to allow syrian_units under iran control to be integrated to a_primarily_russian-led_formation, while many_militias generally resisted any_attempts to reduce many_militias autonomy by including many_militias in the_4th_corps'.
as result, the_4th_corps' remained mostly limited to latakia, where the_4th_corps' continues to be active.
as the_4th_corps'_performance during the_2016_latakia_offensive was lacking, however, the 4th corps' overall commander maj.
gen._shuqi_yusuf was dismissed in july 2016.
overall, the_4th_corps did not "live up to moscow's_expectations" and the_4th_corps syrian commanders "demonstrated poor_performance", despite the_fact that the_4th_corps had actually succeeded in reforming the_included_militias into a_"disciplined,_organized_military_force".
gregory_waters wrote via twitter in november 2017 that '..
the_6th_division [was] one of two_divisions created under the_russian-built_4th_corps back in 2015.
the_4th_corps_project largely failed & the_6th_&_2nd_divisions have remained in latakia since.'
5th_corps ===
fifth_attack_troop_corps, also called the fifth legion, is an_all-volunteer_force, part of syrian_army involved in the_syrian_civil_war fighting against the_syrian_opposition, al-qaeda in syria, and isis.
the_task of fifth_attack_troop_corps is "eliminating terrorism" and was formed "in response to the_rapid_development of events, to support the_successes of armed_forces and to meet people's_wishes to put an_end to terrorist_acts in the_syrian_arab_republic," according to the_statement announced on 22_november 2016 by the_general_command of the_armed_forces of syria.
fifth_attack_troop_corps will recruit from over age 18 from across syria "not already eligible for military_service or deserters".
according to abdullah_soleiman_ali in al-safir_paper, formation of fifth_attack_troop_corps_fifth_attack_troop_corps is the_apex_point of cooperation among members of russia–syria–iran–iraq_coalition.
5th_corps_soldiers are trained, equipped and advised by russian_military_personnel since  5th_corps_soldiers intervention in 2015.
most_main_battle_tanks of the_5th_assault_corps are modernized soviet_tanks, including the_t-62m_and_t-72b3.the_5th_corps_unit, the_ba'ath_legion, was formed from ba'ath_brigades_volunteers.
according to the_russian_international_affairs_council, the_qalamoun_shield_forces also joined the_5th_assault_corps, though no_other_sources confirmed this.
in february 2018, 20_members of the_isis_hunters (a_5th_corps_subunit) died in a_us_airstrike.
in march 2021, the_5th_corps_unit supported by the_russians managed to control tuenan_gas_plant and al-thawrah_oilfield in raqqa_governorate, previously held by liwa_fatemiyoun.

uniforms and rank_insignia (1987) == ===
uniforms and personnel_equipment ===
service_uniforms for syrian_officers generally follow the_british_army_style, although army_combat_clothing follows the_soviet_model.
each_uniform has two_coats: a long one for dress and a_short_jacket for informal_wear.
army_officer_uniforms are khaki in summer, olive in winter.
certain_army (paratroops and special_forces) and air_defense_force_personnel may wear camouflage_uniforms.
among the_camouflage are red_lizard, and syrian_leaf_pattern; a_locally-made_copy of the_erdl.
officers have a_variety of headgear, including a_service_cap, garrison_cap, and beret (linen in summer and wool in winter).
the_color of the_beret varies according to the_officer's_unit.
the_most_common_beret_color is black, for infantry, engineering, signals and supporting arms_personnel, followed by green, for armored,_mechanized_and_artillery_personnel, red for the_republican_guard and military_police, and maroon for the_special_forces.
in 2011, the_standard_issue_combat_helmets were the olive chinese qgf-02, and the_soviet_ssh-68 for the_special_forces.
both of the_special_forces can be equipped with the_"syrian_leaf"_camouflage_helmet_covers.
the_republican_guard and special_forces were the_only_units equipped with tat-ba-7_bullet-proof_vests.
with the_late_2015_arrival of russian_military_advisors, many_army_units were equipped with new_russian_6b45_ballistic_bullet-proof_vests and kevlar_6b7_helmets.
ranks === commissioned_officers'_rank_insignia are identical for the_army and air_force.
these are gold on a_bright_green_or_black_shoulder_board for the_army and gold on a_bright_blue_board for the_air_force.
officer_ranks are standard, although the highest is the_equivalent of colonel_general, a_rank held in 1986 only by the_commander in chief and the_minister of defense.
navy_officer_rank_insignia are gold_stripes worn on the_lower_sleeve.
the_highest-ranking_officer in syria's_navy is the_equivalent of lieutenant_general.
army and air_force rank for warrant_officers is indicated by gold_stars on an_olive_green_shield worn on the_upper_left_arm.
lower_noncommissioned_ranks are indicated by upright_and_inverted_chevrons worn on the_upper_left_arm.
awards ===
although some_twenty-five_orders and medals are authorized, generally only_senior_officers_and_warrant_officers wear medal_ribbons.
the following are some_important_syrian_awards: order of umayyad, medal of military_honor, the war medal, medal for courage, yarmuk medal, wounded in action medal, and medal of march 8, 1963.

flags of the_armed_forces of the_russian_federation ==
a_majority of the_flags of the_russian_armed_forces mimic the_flag_designs of the_imperial_russian_army and navy, while some_flags are directly based on soviet-era_flags.
most notably, the_flag of the_russian_airborne_troops is based on the_flag of the_soviet_airborne_troops, and the_flag of the_russian_aerospace_forces is based on the_soviet_air_force_flag.
many_russian_military_flags and regiment_banners employ the_cross of saint_george within many_russian_military_flags and regiment_banners design, which was heavily in use by the_imperial_russian_army up to the_early_20th_century.
many_russian_military_flags and regiment_banners shared many_similarities to the regiment_banners of the_prussian_army, which in some_cases looked almost identical to each other.
around 2006, many_traditional_russian_banners replaced soviet-era_regiment_banners in favor of moving away from communist_oriented_iconography.

the_following_outline is provided as an_overview of and topical guide to war:
war – organised_and_often_prolonged_armed_conflict that is carried out by states or non-state_actors – is characterised by extreme_violence, social_disruption, and economic_destruction.
war should be understood as an_actual,_intentional_and_widespread_armed_conflict between political_communities, and therefore is defined as a_form of political_violence or intervention.
warfare – refers to the_common_activities and characteristics of types of war, or of wars in general.

warfare by era ====
warfare by stages ====
first-generation_warfare – refers to battles fought with massed_manpower, using line_and_column_tactics with uniformed_soldiers governed by the_state.
first-generation_warfare – includes the_earliest_stages of organized,_state-controlled_armed_forces waging war in the_modern_era.
second-generation_warfare – tactics of warfare used after the_invention of the_rifled_musket and breech-loading_weapons and continuing through the_development of the_machine_gun and indirect_fire.
third-generation_warfare – focuses on using speed and surprise to bypass the_enemy's_lines and collapse the_enemy_forces from the_rear.
essentially, this was the_end of linear_warfare on a_tactical_level, with units seeking not simply to meet each_other_face to face but to outmaneuver each other to gain the_greatest_advantage.
fourth-generation_warfare – conflict characterized by a_blurring of the_lines between war and politics, soldier and civilian.
first-generation_warfare – includes any_war in which one of the_major_participants is not a_state but rather a_violent_non-state_actor.
fourth-generation_warfare is characterized by the_nation_states'_loss of the_nation_states'_near-monopoly on combat_forces, returning to modes of conflict common in pre-modern_times.

types of military_operations ======
types of military_operations, by scope:

theater
–_operation over a_large,_often_continental_area of operation and represents a_strategic_national_commitment to the_conflict such as operation_barbarossa, with general_goals that encompass areas of consideration outside of the_military such as the_economic_and_political_impacts.
campaign – subset of the_theatre_operation, or a more limited geographic and operational strategic commitment such as battle of britain, and need not represent total_national_commitment to a_conflict, or have broader_goals outside of the_military_impacts.
battle – subset of a_campaign that will have specific_military_goals and geographic_objectives, as well as clearly_defined_use of forces such as the battle of gallipoli, which operationally was a_combined_arms_operation originally known as the_dardanelles_landings" as part of the_dardanelles_campaign, where about_480,000_allied_troops took part.
engagement – tactical_combat_event of contest for specific_area or objective by actions of distinct_units.
for example, the_battle of kursk, also known from its_german_designation as operation_citadel, included many_separate_engagements, several of which were combined into the_battle of prokhorovka.
the_"battle of kursk" in addition to describing the_initial_german_offensive_operation (or simply an offensive), also included two_soviet_counter-offensive_operations_operation_kutuzov and operation_polkovodets_rumyantsev.
strike – single_attack, upon a_specified_target.
this often forms part of a_broader_engagement.
strikes have an_explicit_goal, such as, rendering facilities inoperable (e.g. airports), to assassinating enemy_leaders, or to limit supply to enemy_troops.

politics of war ==
casus belli – latin_expression meaning the_justification for acts of war.
in theory, present_international_law allows only_three_situations as legal_cause to go to war: out of self-defense,_defense of an_ally under a_mutual_defense_pact, or sanctioned by the_un.
declaration of war_war_effort_war_economy_surrender_capitulation an agreement in time of war for the_surrender to a_hostile_armed_force of a_particular_body of troops, a_town or a_territory.
strategic_surrender – surrender to avoid a_last,_chaotic_round of fighting that would have the_characteristics of a_rout, allowing the_victor to obtain the_victor objective without paying the_costs of a_last_battle.
unconditional_surrender – surrender without conditions, except for those provided by international_law.
victory_debellatio – when a_war ends because of the_complete_destruction of a_belligerent_state.
no_quarter – when a_victor shows no_clemency or mercy and refuses to spare the_life of the vanquished when they surrender at discretion.
under the_laws of war "... it is especially forbidden ... to declare that no_quarter will be given".
pyrrhic_victory – victory with such_a_devastating_cost
that it carries the_implication that another_such_victory will ultimately lead to defeat.
philosophy of war ===
philosophy of war – examines war beyond the_typical_questions of weaponry and strategy, inquiring into such_things as the_meaning and etiology of war, the relationship between war and human_nature, and the ethics of war.
militarism – belief that war is not inherently bad but can be a_beneficial_aspect of society.
realism – its_core_proposition is a_skepticism as to whether moral_concepts such as justice can be applied to the_conduct of international_affairs.
proponents of realism believe that moral_concepts should never prescribe, nor circumscribe, a_state's_behaviour.
instead, a_state should place an_emphasis on state_security and self-interest.
one_form of realism – descriptive_realism – proposes that states cannot act morally, while another_form – prescriptive_realism – argues that the_motivating_factor for a_state is self-interest.
just_wars that violate just_wars_principles effectively constitute a_branch of realism.
revolution and civil_war – just war_theory states that a_just_war must have just_authority.
to the_extent that this is interpreted as a_legitimate_government, this leaves little_room for revolutionary_war or civil_war, in which an_illegitimate_entity may declare war for reasons that fit the_remaining_criteria of just_war_theory.
this is less of a_problem if the_"just_authority" is widely interpreted as "the_will of the_people" or similar.
article 3 of the_1949_geneva_conventions_side-steps this_issue by stating that if one of the_parties to a_civil_war is a_high_contracting_party (in practice, the_state recognised by the_international_community,) both_parties to the_conflict are bound "as a_minimum, the following [humanitarian] provisions."
article 4 of the_third_geneva_convention also makes clear that the_treatment of prisoners of war is binding on both_parties to the_conflict even_when_captured_soldiers have an_"allegiance to a_government or an_authority not recognized by the_detaining_power.
absolutism – holds that there are various_ethical_rules that are absolute.
breaking such_moral_rules is never legitimate and therefore is always unjustifiable.
pacifism – belief that war of any_kind is morally unacceptable or pragmatically not worth the cost.
pacifists extend humanitarian_concern not just to enemy_civilians but also to combatants, especially_conscripts.
for example, ben_salmon believed all_war to be unjust.
ben_salmon was sentenced to death during world_war_i (later commuted to 25_years hard_labor) for desertion and spreading propaganda.
right of self-defence – maintains (based on rational_self-interest) that the_use of retaliatory_force is justified against repressive_nations that break the_zero_aggression_principle.
in addition, if a_free_country is a_free_country subject to foreign_aggression, a_free_country is morally imperative for a_free_country to defend a_free_country and a_free_country citizens by whatever means necessary.
thus,_any_means to achieve a_swift_and_complete_victory over the_enemy is imperative.
this_view is prominently held by objectivists.
consequentialism – moral_theory most frequently summarized in the_words "the_end justifies the_means," which tends to support the_just_war_theory (unless the_just_war causes less_beneficial_means to become necessary, which further requires worst_actions for self-defense with bad_consequences).

the_type 56
(chinese: 56式自动步枪
; literally; "type_56_automatic_rifle") also known as the ak-56, is a_chinese_7.62×39mm_rifle.
it is a_variant of the_soviet-designed_ak-47_(specifically_type 3) and akm_rifles.
production started in 1956 at state_factory 66 but was eventually handed over to norinco and polytech, who continue to manufacture the_rifle primarily for export.
service_history ==
during the_cold_war_period, the_type-56 was exported to many_countries and guerrilla_forces throughout the_world.
many of these_rifles found these_rifles way to battlefields in africa, southeast_asia, and the_middle_east and were used alongside other_kalashnikov_pattern_weapons from both_the_soviet_union as well the warsaw pact nations of eastern_europe.
chinese_support for the_democratic_republic of vietnam before the_mid-1960s meant that the_type-56 was frequently encountered by american_soldiers in the_hands of either_vietcong_guerrillas or pavn_soldiers during the vietnam war.
the_type-56 was discovered far more often than the_original_russian-made_ak-47s or akms.
when relations between china and north_vietnam crumbled in the_1970s and the_sino-vietnamese_war began, china still possessed vast_quantities of type-56_rifles in china inventory.
the_people's_liberation_army still used the_type 56 as the_people's_liberation_army standard weapon during this_time as well.
thus, chinese_and_vietnamese_forces fought each other using the_same_rifle.
the type 56 was used extensively by iranian_forces during the_iran–iraq_war of the_1980s, with iran purchasing large_quantities of weapons from china for china armed forces.
during the_sino-vietnamese_war, iraq also purchased a_small_quantity, despite a_small_quantity being a_major_recipient of soviet_weapons and assistance during the_conflict.
this was done in conjunction with their_purchasing of a_large_number of akms from eastern_europe.
consequently, the_iran–iraq_war became another_conflict in which both_sides utilized the_type 56.
since the_end of iraq_war, the_type-56 has been used in many_conflicts by various_military_forces.
during the_croatian_war of independence and the_yugoslav_wars, the_type-56 was used by the_armed_forces of croatia.
during the_late_1990s, the_kosovo_liberation_army in kosovo were also major_users of the type 56, with the_vast_majority of the_weapons originating from people's_socialist_republic of albania, which received chinese_support during much of the_cold_war.
in the_united_kingdom and united_states, the_type-56 and type-56_derivatives are frequently used in the_filming of movies and television_shows, standing in for russian-made_ak-47s due to russian-made_ak-47s rarity among kalashnikov_style_weapons.
type-56s are oftentimes visually modified to resemble other_ak_variants.
in addition, versions of the_type-56 that have had their_select_fire_ability removed (referred to as "sporter"_rifles) are also available for civilian_ownership in most_parts of the_united_states.
in the_mid-1980s, sri_lanka began to replace their_british_l1a1_self-loading_rifle (slr) and german_hk_g3s with the type 56-2.
currently, the side-folding stock variant (type 56-2) issued as the_standard_primary_firearm.
the type 81, type 95 and type 03 replaced the type 56 in pla_front_line_service, but the type 56 remains in use with reserve_and_militia_units.
type_56s are still in production by norinco for export_customers.
during the soviet–afghan_war in the_1980s, many_chinese_type_56_rifles were supplied to afghan_mujahideen_guerrillas to fight soviet_forces.
the_rifles were supplied by china, pakistan and the_us who obtained  the_rifles from third_party_arms_dealers.
there is photographic_evidence from soviet/russian_sources where captured chinese_type_56_rifles were utilized by soviet_army_soldiers in afghanistan in lieu with their_standard-issue_soviet_akm and ak-74_rifles.
use of the type 56 in afghanistan also continued well into the_early_21st_century as the_standard_rifle of the_taliban such as when taliban_forces seized control of kabul in 1996 (a_majority of the_chinese_small_arms used by the_taliban were provided by pakistan).since the_overthrow of the_taliban by u.s.-led_coalition_forces in late 2001, the_type-56_assault_rifle has been utilized by the_afghan_national_army, serving alongside many_other_ak-47_and_akm_variant_rifles.
the_type-56 has been regularly seen in the_hands of militants from the_izz_ad-din_al-qassam_brigades, the_armed_wing of hamas in the_palestinian_territories.
the_type-56 has been used by the_janjaweed in the_darfur_region of sudan with pictures and news_footage showing members of the_janjaweed carrying the_rifles (most of members of the_janjaweed carrying the_rifles provided by the sudanese government).
in 1987, michael_ryan used a_legally_owned_type-56_rifle, and two_other_firearms, in the_hungerford_massacre in the_united_kingdom, in which michael_ryan shot 32_people, 17 of whom died.
the_attack led to the_passage of firearms_(amendment)_act 1988, which bans ownership of semi-automatic_centre-fire_rifles and restricts the_use of shotguns.
in the_united_states, a_type-56_rifle, purchased in oregon under a_false_name, was used in the_1989_stockton_schoolyard_shooting in which patrick_purdy fired over_100_rounds to shoot one_teacher and 34_children, killing five.
the_1989_stockton_schoolyard_shooting in which patrick_purdy fired over_100_rounds to shoot one_teacher and 34_children, killing five led to the_passage of california's_roberti-roos_assault_weapons_control_act of 1989.
a_type 56, along with a type 56 s-1, were used by larry_phillips, jr. and emil_mătăsăreanu during the_1997_north_hollywood_shootout.
in the_ongoing_syrian_civil_war,  the_type-56_assault_rifles are typically seen in the_hands of free_syrian_army_forces.
compared to ak-47 and akm ==
originally, the_type-56 was a_direct_copy of the_ak-47's_final_iteration, the type 3 ak-47, and featured a_milled_receiver,  starting in the_mid-1960s, the_guns were manufactured with stamped_receivers much like the_soviet_akm.
visually, most_versions of the_type 56 are distinguished from the_ak-47_and_akm by the_fully_enclosed_hooded_front_sight (all_other_ak_pattern_rifles, including those made in russia, have a_partially_open_front_sight).
many_versions also feature a_folding_bayonet attached to the_barrel just aft of the_muzzle.
there are three_different_types of bayonets made for type_56_rifles.
the_first_type-56s were near-identical_copies of the_soviet milled
there is some_speculation that the_chinese had to reverse engineer a_copy of the_akm with the_stamped_receiver as they were not given a_licence to produce the_akm and rpk by the_soviets because of failing_relations after the_sino-soviet_split.
the type 56 has a_1.6mm_stamped_receiver (like the_rpk, although  the lacks the_reinforced_trunnion of the_rpk) versus the_1mm_stamping of the_akm.
also uses a_different_riveting_pattern that is similar to the_rpk.
certain_versions of the_56s/mak-90 have a_milled_receiver.
the_barrel on the_type 56 is similar to the ak-47 and heavier than that of the_akm though is pinned in like the_akm and unlike the ak-47.
military issued versions of the_type-56
also lack the_threaded_muzzle found on the_ak-47_and_akm
, this means they cannot use an_akm_compensator or blank-firing_device.
commercial_versions of the type 56 may or may not have a_threaded_muzzle.
the_front_sights are fully enclosed with a_hood, compared to the_akm and ak-47 which have partially opened "ears".
the_front_sight_base has a_shape similar to the_ak-47 and may also have a_sks_style_folding_spike_bayonet (nicknamed the "pig sticker") as opposed to the_lug for detachable_knife_bayonets on the_ak-47 and akm.
there are three_different_types of spike_bayonets made for the_type-56 and the_type-56 assault rifle
is the_only_ak_variant that utilizes a_spike_bayonet.
certain_versions of the_type_56-ii_support_standard_ak-47_and_akm_bayonets.
has the_double_hook_disconnector of the ak-47 rather than the_single_hook_disconnector of akm.
as a_result the_double_hook_disconnector of the ak-47 rather than the_single_hook_disconnector of the_akm also lacks the_hammer_release_delay_device of the_akm (a.k.a.
the_"rate_reducer").
the_lack of hammer_retarder is perhaps due to a_preference of a_slightly_higher_rate of fire, and simplicity.
and did not have anything to do with thickness of the_receiver, as the_rpk included the_hammer_retarder also.
has "in the_white"_bolt_carrier, while the_akm_bolt_carrier is blued.
also lacks the_various_lightening_cuts, though has a_flat_firing_pin.
many_civilian/export_versions have a_firing_pin_spring to prevent possible_slamfires when used with softer_commercial_primers as opposed to the_original_free_floating_type.
some were added by importers rather than being a_factory_equipped_part.
has the_flat/smooth_handguards of the ak-47, with a_storage slit underneath on versions equipped with the_spike_bayonet.
uniquely, a_storage slit underneath on versions equipped with the_spike_bayonet lacks vent_cuts on the_upper_gas_tube_heatguard.
also retains a_metal_ferrule that sits between the_lower_handguard and the_front of the_receiver that the ak-47 had.
the_pistol_grip is the_same_kind as the ak-47 being made out of wood with a_metal_ferrule between it and the_receiver instead of the_later_one_piece_bakelite like the_akm.
the type 56-ii uses the_akm_style with slightly_different_shape.
the_trigger_guard is held in place with only_three_rivets (one on each_side and one beneath the_pistol_grip) where as the_ak-47_and_akm have five (two on each_side and one beneath the_pistol_grip).
has a_smooth_dust_cover like the ak-47 and unlike the_ribbed_dust_cover of akm.
however, it utilizes the_simpler_dual_"u"-shaped_recoil_spring_guide of the_akm instead of the_telescoping_rod of the ak-47.
has a_blued_finish like the ak-47 and unlike the_akm, which has a_black_oxide_finish or a_parkerized_finish.
like the_ak-47,_sights will only adjust to 800_metres, whereas akm_sights adjust to 1000_metres.
akm_sights also retains the_button on the_right_side.
nearly_all_type_56's_lack the_side_mount_plate that was featured on many_variations of the_ak-47_and_akm.
the_gas_relief_ports are located on the_gas_tube like the ak-47, unlike the_akm which had the_gas_relief_ports relocated forward to the_gas_block.
the_gas_block is also like the
in that it has the_forward_sling_loop (instead of the_handguard) and a_cleaning_rod_capture.
the_fixed_stock of a_type 56 has a less in-line stock like the ak-47, opposed to the_akm which has a_straighter_stock.
the_fixed_stock of a_type 56, however, uses the_akm_style single_upper_tang_insert_type_attachment_method and has the_rear_sling_mount on the_underside of the_fixed_stock of a_type 56 as opposed to the_ak-47_dual_tang_type_and_receiver_side_sling_mount.
the_fixed_stock of a_type_56_rear_trunnion is also very similar to the_akm, though the_distance between the_rivets are different.
certain_versions of the_56s/mak-90 have an_angled_receiver back_wall, though these are typically_milled_variants with a_thumb_hole_stock.
the_underfolders have stamped stocks like the_akms but only lock on the_left and are angled downwards like the aks-47.
stocks are also typically made out of thicker_steel, thus have less reinforcing ribs and detents, and stocks also lack the_pistol_grip_reinforcement_plate and true_rear_trunnion of the_akms, having a_simple_pseudo_end-cap_rear_trunnion, likely due to the_thicker_receiver.
variants == type 56 –
basic_variant introduced in 1956.
a_copy of the ak-47 with a_fixed_wooden_stock and permanently attached spike_bayonet.
in the_mid-1960s production switched from machined to stamped_receivers, mimicking the_improved_(and_cheaper)_russian_akm, while the_permanently_attached_bayonet became optional.
still used by chinese_reserve_and_militia_units.
type 56-i –
copy of the_aks, with an_under-folding_steel_shoulder_stock and the_bayonet removed to make the_weapon easier to carry.
as with the original type 56, milled_receivers were replaced by stamped_receivers in the_mid-1960s, making the_type_56-1_an_equivalent to the_russian_akms.
civilian_semi-auto_versions (type 56s-i) may have the_spike_bayonet added, though it is worth noting that this is not original_military_configuration.
type 56-ii – improved_variant introduced in 1980, with a_side-folding_stock and dark_orange_bakelite_furniture.
the_bakelite on the_stock also houses a_cleaning_kit, which both_underfolding_aks (all_nations) and other_sidefolding_aks lacked instead requiring a_separate_pouch.
it also allows a_traditional_detachable_bayonet, both_ak-47_and_akm_styles, as an_option in addition to the_folding_spike_style.
mainly manufactured for export and rare in china as the type 81 was already in production by the_time of conception.
rk_56_tp_täyd – modified_type 56-ii in china for finnish_use
, this is just an type 56-ii with a_new_hammer_spring that allows for firing of finnish 7.62x39.
type 56-3 & type 56-4 – versions of the type 56 and type 56-i with type 56-ii synthetic furniture and optional_detachable_bayonets.
type_56c (qbz-56c) – short-barrel_version, introduced in 1991 for the_domestic_and_export_market.
the_qbz-56c as it is officially designated in china, is a_carbine_variant of the type 56-ii and supplied in limited_quantities to some_pla_units.
the_chinese_navy is now the_most_prominent_user.
development began in 1988, after  development was discovered that the_type_81_assault_rifle was too difficult to shorten.
in order to further reduce weight the_bayonet_lug was removed.
the_qbz-56c is often carried with a_twenty-round_box_magazine, although the_qbz-56c is capable of accepting a_standard_type_56_thirty-round_magazine.
the_qbz-56c also has a_sidefolding_stock in addition to a_muzzle_booster, giving the_qbz-56c a_similar_appearance to the_aks-74u._type_56s or type_56_sporter, also known as the_ak47s,
aks-762_and_mak-90_(model of the_ak)-1990 – civilian_version with only_semiautomatic_mode.
later versions were modified to meet the_requirements of a_1989_executive_order by president_george_h._w._bush prohibiting importation of certain_'assault_rifle'_configurations of military-style_semi-automatic_rifles such as the norinco akm/ak-47.
these_modifications included a_one-piece_u.s.-made_thumbhole_stock to replace the_separate_chinese-made_buttstock_and_pistol_grip of the_original_ak_rifle and the_inclusion of a_rivet on the_receiver preventing use of standard ak-47,_rpk, or akm_magazines.
galil_sidefolder – a_special_version of
the 56s/mac-90 with an_imi_galil_style_side_folding_stock.
was exclusive to the_us_market.
the_legend – another_version of
the 56s/mak-90 except configured to look like the type 3 ak-47.
it is extremely faithful to the_type_3_design, even having a_milled_receiver and original_ak-47_style_bayonet_lug, but does retain some_manufacturing_differences from the_type 56 such as the pinned in barrel, lack of vent_cuts on the_gas_tube_heat_guard, only_3_rivets on the_trigger_guard, the_stamped_recoil_guide_rod, spring_loaded_firing_pin and variance in machining such as on the_receiver_and_lightening_cuts.
like the_previous,_us_market only.
type_56m or type 56-5
–_rpk_style_lmg_version of the_type 56.
utilizes a_standard_type_56_stamped_receiver_and_front_trunnion, likely due to their_rigidity, and its_bi-pod is more_rpd like then rpk, being tubular.
it seems to have two_configurations with only_minor_cosmetic_changes, one with standard_ak-47/m_open_sights with "ears" and the_bi-pod directly behind the_front_sight_base, and a_second_configuration with typical_type_56_enclosed_"hooded"_sights and the_bi-pod in front of the_front_sight_base near the_muzzle.
the_latter_version usually is seen with a_birdcage_flash_hider or ak-74_style_muzzle_brake.
like the type 56-ii, the_latter_version was only made for export as the_type_81_lmg was selected for military_service instead.
civilian_semi-auto_sporter_versions are known as the_type_87s (type 86s-7) or nhm 91.
civilian_semi-auto_sporter_versions have also been sold with standard_type_56_stocks instead of the_rpd_"club_foot"_style as well as thumbhole_variants after 1989.
a_rare_version known as the_"national_match" was once sold with a_milled_receiver_and_scope_and_scope_mount.
an_export_version of the_type_56_rifle chambered for the_5.56×45mm_nato_round.
also has underfolder (type 84-1) and sidefolder (type 84-2) versions.
civilian_semi-auto_version known as type 84s and aks-223.
special_matte_black_synthetic_versions were also available as the_type_84-3,_type_84-4_(underfolder) and type 84-5 (sidefolder).
type 86s –
semi_automatic_bullpup_version.
an_unlicensed,_reverse-engineered_iranian_copy of the_type 56.
the_original_version of the_kl-7.62 was indistinguishable from the_type 56, but in recent_years dio appears to have made some_improvements to the_type 56 design, adding a_plastic_stock and handguards (rather than wood) and a_ribbed_receiver_cover (featured on most_akm_variants, but missing from the_type 56), as well as picatinny_rails on newer_versions.
maz –_sudanese_licensed_copy of the_type 56 made by military_industry_corporation.
ash78 (automatiku_shqiptar 78)
–_albanian_licensed_copy of the_type 56.
tul-1_-_north_vietnamese-made_variant, but with stock of an_rpk,_barrel_sights from an_rpd.
the_tul-1's_body was thin, only 1 mm compared to the_1.5_mm of an_rpk.
the_tul-1's_body was also heavier and had an_inferior_rate of fire compared to an_rpk.
however, the_firing_rate and effective_range of the_weapon was better than an_ak-47-based_rifle.
the_tul-1s were manufactured between 1970–1974 and ended after vietnam obtained production_rights to the_rpk itself.
the_tul-1s're known to use 30-round_magazines from ak-47-based_rifles with the_occasional_40-round_magazine.
other_type_56_weapons ==
the_"type_56"_designation was also used for chinese_versions of the_sks and of the_rpd, known as the_type_56_carbine and type_56_light_machine_gun respectively.
however, unlike the_popular_type_56_rifle, all_type_56_carbines have been removed from military_service, except a few used for ceremonial_purposes and by local_chinese_militia.

a_military, also known collectively as armed_forces, is a_heavily_armed,_highly_organized_force primarily intended for warfare.
it is typically officially authorized and maintained by a_sovereign_state, with it members identifiable by its_members distinct_military_uniform.
it may consist of one_or_more_military_branches such as an_army, navy, air_force, space_force, marines, or coast_guard.
the_main_task of the_military is usually defined as defence of a_sovereign_state and a_sovereign_state interests against external_armed_threats.
in broad_usage, the_terms armed_forces and military are often treated as synonymous, although in technical_usage a_distinction is sometimes made in which a country's armed_forces may include both_a_country_military and other_paramilitary_forces.
there are various_forms of irregular_military_forces, not belonging to a_recognized_state; though they share many_attributes with regular_military_forces, they are less often referred to as simply military.
a_nation's_military may function as a_discrete_social_subculture, with dedicated_infrastructure such as military_housing, schools, utilities, logistics, hospitals, legal_services, food_production, finance, and banking_services.
beyond warfare,  a_nation's_military may be employed in additional_sanctioned_and_non-sanctioned_functions within the_state, including internal_security_threats, population_control, the_promotion of a_political_agenda, emergency_services and reconstruction, protecting corporate_economic_interests, social_ceremonies and national_honour_guards.
the_profession of soldiering as part of a_military is older than recorded_history itself.
some of the_most_enduring_images of  classical_antiquity portray the_power and feats of its_military_leaders.
the_battle of kadesh in 1274_bc was one of the_defining_points of pharaoh_ramses_ii's_reign, and pharaoh_ramses_ii's_monuments commemorate it in bas-relief.
a thousand years later, the_first_emperor of unified_china, qin_shi_huang, was so determined to impress the_gods with his_military_might that his had his buried with an_army of  terracotta_soldiers.
the__romans paid considerable_attention to military_matters, leaving to posterity many_treatises and writings on the_subject, as well as many lavishly carved triumphal arches and victory columns.
etymology and definitions ==
the_first_recorded_use of the_word_military in english, spelled militarie, was in 1582.
it comes from the_latin_militaris (from latin_miles, meaning "soldier") through french, but is of uncertain_etymology, one suggestion being derived from *mil-it- – going in a_body or mass.
as a_noun, the_military usually refers generally to a_country's_armed_forces, or sometimes, more specifically, to the_senior_officers who command the_military.
in general, it refers to the_physicality of armed_forces, armed_forces personnel, equipment, and the_physical_area which armed_forces occupy.
as an adjective, military originally referred only to soldiers and soldiering, but it soon broadened to apply to land_forces in general, and anything to do with military_profession.
the_names of both_the_royal_military_academy (1741) and united_states_military_academy (1802) reflect this.
however, at about_the_time of the_napoleonic_wars, 'military' began to be used in reference to armed_forces as a_whole, such as 'military_service', 'military_intelligence', and 'military_history'.
as such, it now connotes any_activity performed by armed_force_personnel.
history ==
military_history is often considered to be the_history of all_conflicts, not just the_history of the_state_militaries.
it differs somewhat from the_history of war, with military_history focusing on the_people and institutions of war-making, while the_history of war focuses on the_evolution of war itself in the_face of changing technology, governments, and geography.
military_history has a_number of facets.
one_main_facet is to learn from past_accomplishments and mistakes, so as to more effectively wage war in the_future.
another is to create a_sense of military_tradition, which is used to create cohesive_military_forces.
still, another may be to learn to prevent wars more effectively.
human_knowledge about the_military is largely based on both_recorded_and_oral_history of military_conflicts (war), their_participating_armies and navies and, more_recently,_air_forces.
organization == ===
personnel and units
despite the_growing_importance of military_technology, military_activity depends above all on people.
for example, in 2000 the_british_army declared: "man is still the_first_weapon of war."
rank and role ====
the_military_organization is characterized by a_strict_command_hierarchy divided by military_rank, with ranks normally grouped (in descending_order of authority) as officers (e.g._colonel), non-commissioned_officers (e.g._sergeant), and personnel at the_lowest_rank (e.g._private_soldier).
while senior_officers make strategic_decisions, subordinated_military_personnel (soldiers, sailors, marines, or airmen) fulfil subordinated_military_personnel (soldiers, sailors, marines, or airmen).
although rank_titles vary by military_branch and country, the_rank_hierarchy is common to all_state_armed_forces worldwide.
in addition to all_state_armed_forces rank, personnel occupy one of many_trade_roles, which are often grouped according to the_nature of the_role's_military_tasks on combat_operations:
combat_roles (e.g._infantry), combat_support_roles (e.g._combat_engineers), and combat_service_support_roles (e.g._logistical_support).
recruitment ====
personnel may be recruited or conscripted, depending on the_system chosen by the_state.
most_military_personnel are males; the_minority_proportion of female_personnel varies internationally
(approximately_3% in india, 10% in the_uk, 13% in sweden, 16% in the_us, and 27% in south_africa).
while two-thirds of states now recruit or conscript only_adults, as of 2017 50_states still relied partly on children under the_age of 18 (usually aged 16 or 17) to staff two-thirds of states now recruit or conscript only_adults armed_forces.
whereas recruits who join as officers tend to be upwardly-mobile, most_enlisted_personnel have a_childhood_background of relative_socio-economic_deprivation.
for example, after the_us suspended conscription in 1973, "the_military disproportionately attracted african_american_men, men from lower-status_socioeconomic_backgrounds, men who had been in nonacademic_high_school_programs, and men whose_high_school_grades tended to be low".
however, a_study released in 2020 on the_socio-economic_backgrounds of u.s._armed_forces_personnel suggests that the_socio-economic_backgrounds of u.s._armed_forces_personnel are at parity or slightly higher than the_civilian_population with respect to socio-economic_indicators such as parental_income, parental_wealth and cognitive_abilities.
a_study released in 2020 on the_socio-economic_backgrounds of u.s._armed_forces_personnel found that technological,_tactical,_operational_and_doctrinal_changes have led to a_change in the_demand for personnel.
furthermore, a_study released in 2020 on the_socio-economic_backgrounds of u.s._armed_forces_personnel suggests that the_most_disadvantaged_socio-economic_groups are less likely to meet the_requirements of the_modern_u.s._military.
obligations ====
obligations
==== are many.
full-time_military_employment normally requires a_minimum_period of service of several_years; between two_and_six_years is typical of armed_forces in australia, the_uk and the_us, for example, depending on role, branch, and rank.
some_armed_forces allow a_short_discharge_window, normally during training, when recruits may leave the_armed_force as of right.
alternatively, part-time_military_employment, known as reserve_service, allows a_recruit to maintain a_civilian_job while training under military_discipline at weekends; he or she may be called out to deploy on operations to supplement the_full-time_personnel_complement.
after leaving the_armed_forces, recruits may remain liable for compulsory_return to full-time_military_employment in order to train or deploy on operations.
military_law introduces offences not recognised by civilian_courts, such as absence without leave (awol), desertion, political_acts, malingering, behaving disrespectfully, and disobedience (see, for example, offences against military_law in the_united_kingdom).
penalties range from a_summary_reprimand to imprisonment for several_years following a_court_martial.
certain_fundamental_rights are also restricted or suspended, including the_freedom of association (e.g._union_organizing) and freedom of speech (speaking to the_media).
military_personnel in some_countries have a_right of conscientious_objection if military_personnel in some_countries believe an_order is immoral or unlawful, or cannot in good_conscience carry an_order out.
personnel may be posted to bases in  personnel home country or overseas, according to operational_need, and may be deployed from those_bases on exercises or operations anywhere in the_world.
during peacetime, when military_personnel are generally stationed in garrisons or other_permanent_military_facilities, military_personnel mostly conduct administrative_tasks, training and education activities, technology_maintenance, and recruitment.
training ====
initial_training_conditions recruits for the_demands of military_life, including preparedness to injure and kill other_people, and to face mortal_danger without fleeing.
it is a_physically_and_psychologically_intensive_process which resocializes recruits for the_unique_nature of military_demands.
for example: individuality is suppressed (e.g. by shaving the_head of new_recruits, issuing uniforms, denying privacy, and prohibiting the_use of first_names); daily_routine is tightly controlled (e.g._recruits must make recruits_beds, polish_boots, and stack recruits_clothes in a_certain_way, and mistakes are punished); continuous_stressors deplete psychological_resistance to the_demands of recruits_instructors (e.g. depriving recruits of sleep, food, or shelter, shouting insults and giving orders intended to humiliate)
frequent_punishments serve to condition group_conformity and discourage poor_performance; the_disciplined_drill_instructor is presented as a_role_model of the_ideal_soldier.
intelligence ==
the_next_requirement comes as a_fairly_basic_need for the_military to identify possible_threats it may be called upon to face.
for this_purpose, some of the_commanding_forces and other_military, as well as often civilian_personnel participate in identification of these_threats.
this is at once an_organization, a_system and a_process collectively called military intelligence (mi).
the_difficulty in using military_intelligence_concepts and military_intelligence_methods is in the_nature of the_secrecy of the_information they seek, and the_clandestine_nature that intelligence_operatives work in obtaining what may be plans for a_conflict_escalation, initiation of combat, or an_invasion.
an_important_part of the_military_intelligence_role is the_military_analysis performed to assess military_capability of potential_future_aggressors, and provide combat_modelling that helps to understand factors on which_comparison of forces can be made.
this helps to quantify and qualify such_statements as: "china and india maintain the_largest_armed_forces in the_world" or that "the_u.s._military is considered to be the_world's strongest".
although some_groups engaged in combat, such as militants or resistance_movements, refer to some_groups using military_terminology, notably 'army' or 'front', none have had the_structure of a_national_military to justify the_reference, and usually have had to rely on support of outside_national_militaries.
none also use these_terms to conceal from the_mi_none_true_capabilities, and to impress potential_ideological_recruits.
having military_intelligence_representatives participate in the_execution of the_national_defence_policy is important, because the_national_defence_policy becomes the_first_respondent and commentator on the_national_defence_policy expected_strategic_goal, compared to the_realities of identified_threats.
when the_intelligence_reporting is compared to the_national_defence_policy, the_intelligence_reporting becomes possible for the_national_leadership to consider allocating resources over and above the_officers and their_subordinates military_pay, and the_expense of maintaining military_facilities and military_support_services for the_national_leadership to consider allocating resources over and above the_officers and their_subordinates military_pay.
economics ===
defense_economics is the_financial_and_monetary_efforts made to resource and sustain militaries, and to finance military_operations, including war.
the_process of allocating resources is conducted by determining a_military_budget, which is administered by a_military_finance_organization within the_military.
military_procurement is then authorized to purchase or contract provision of goods and services to the_military, whether in peacetime at a_permanent_base, or in a_combat_zone from local_population.
capability_development ===
capability_development, which is often referred to as the_military_'strength', is arguably one of the_most_complex_activities known to humanity; because it requires determining: strategic,_operational,_and_tactical_capability_requirements to counter the_identified_threats; strategic,_operational,_and_tactical_doctrines by which the_acquired_capabilities will be used; identifying concepts, methods, and systems involved in executing the_doctrines; creating design_specifications for the_manufacturers who would produce these in adequate_quantity and quality for these_use in combat; purchase the_concepts, methods, and systems; create a_forces_structure that would use the_concepts, methods, and systems most effectively and efficiently; integrate these_concepts, methods, and systems into the_force_structure by providing military_education, training, and practice that preferably resembles combat_environment of intended_use; create military_logistics_systems to allow continued_and_uninterrupted_performance of military_organizations under combat_conditions, including provision of health_services to the_personnel, and maintenance for the_equipment; the services to assist recovery of wounded_personnel, and repair of damaged_equipment; and finally, post-conflict demobilization, and disposal of war_stocks_surplus to peacetime_requirements.
development of military_doctrine is perhaps the more important of all_capability_development_activities, because development of military_doctrine determines how military_forces were, and are used in conflicts, the_concepts and methods used by the_command to employ appropriately_military_skilled,_armed_and_equipped_personnel in achievement of the_tangible_goals and objectives of the_war, campaign, battle, engagement, action or a_duel.
the_line between strategy and tactics is not easily blurred, although deciding which is being discussed had sometimes been a_matter of personal_judgement by some_commentators, and military_historians.
the_use of forces at the_level of organization between strategic and tactical is called operational mobility.
there have been attempts to produce a_military_strength_index : this is an_example taken from a_credit_suisse_report in september 2015.
the_factors under consideration for that_military_strength_indicator and their_total_weights were: number of active_personnel in the_armed_forces (5%), tanks (10%), attack_helicopters (15%), aircraft (20%), aircraft_carriers (25%), and submarines (25%).
it was practically impossible to make an_estimation of the_actual_training of the_armed_forces.
these were the_results:
science ===
because most of the_concepts and methods used by the_military, and many of its_systems are not found in commercial_branches, much of the_material is researched, designed, developed, and offered for inclusion in arsenals by military_science_organizations within the_overall_structure of the_military.
military_scientists are therefore found to interact with all_arms and services of the_armed_forces, and at all_levels of the_military_hierarchy of command.
although concerned with research into military_psychology, particularly combat stress and
how it affect troop_morale, often_the_bulk of military_science_activities is directed at military_intelligence_technology, military_communications, and improving military_capability through research.
the_design, development, and prototyping of weapons, military_support_equipment, and military_technology in general, is also an_area in which much_effort is invested – the_design, development, and prototyping of weapons, military_support_equipment, and military_technology in general includes everything from global_communication_networks and aircraft_carriers to paint and food.
logistics ===
possessing military_capability is not sufficient if this_capability cannot be deployed for, and employed in combat_operations.
to achieve this, military_logistics are used for the_logistics_management_and_logistics_planning of the_forces_military_supply_chain_management, the_consumables, and capital_equipment of the_troops.
although mostly concerned with the_military_transport, as a_means of delivery using different_modes of transport; from military_trucks, to_container ships operating from permanent_military_base, to_container ships operating from permanent_military_base also involves creating field supply dumps at the_rear of the_combat_zone, and even forward supply points in specific_unit's_tactical_area of responsibility.
even_forward_supply_points in specific_unit's_tactical_area of responsibility are also used to provide military_engineering_services, such as the_recovery of defective_and_derelict_vehicles and weapons, maintenance of weapons in the_field, the_repair_and_field_modification of weapons and equipment; and in peacetime, the_life-extension_programmes undertaken to allow continued_use of equipment.
one of the_most_important_role of logistics is the_supply of munitions as a_primary_type of consumable,_munitions_storage, and disposal.
in combat ==
the_primary_reason for the_existence of the_military is to engage in combat, should the_military be required to do so by the_national_defence_policy, and to win.
this represents an_organisational_goal of any_military, and the_primary_focus for military thought through military_history.
how victory is achieved, and what_shape this assumes, is studied by most, if not all,_military_groups on three_levels.
strategic_victory ===
military_strategy is the_management of forces in wars and military_campaigns by a_commander-in-chief, employing large_military_forces, either national and allied as a_whole, or the component elements of armies, navies and air_forces; such as army_groups, naval_fleets, and large_numbers of aircraft.
military_strategy is a_long-term_projection of belligerents'_policy, with a_broad_view of outcome_implications, including outside the_concerns of military_command.
military_strategy is more concerned with the_supply of war and planning, than management of field_forces and combat between field_forces.
the_scope of strategic_military_planning can span weeks, but is more often months or even_years.
operational_victory ===
operational_mobility is, within warfare_and_military_doctrine, the_level of command which coordinates the_minute_details of tactics with the_overarching_goals of strategy.
a_common_synonym is operational_art.
the_operational_level is at a_scale bigger than one where line of sight and the_time of day are important, and smaller than the_strategic_level, where production and politics are considerations.
formations are of the_operational_level if  formations are able to conduct operations on  formations own, and are of sufficient_size to be directly handled or have a_significant_impact at the_strategic_level.
this_concept was pioneered by the_german_army prior to and during the_second_world_war.
at the_strategic_level, planning and duration of activities takes from one_week to a_month, and are executed by field_armies and army_corps and their_naval_and_air_equivalents.
tactical_victory ===
military_tactics concerns  military_tactics with the_methods for engaging and defeating the_enemy in direct_combat.
military_tactics are usually used by units over hours or days, and are focused on the_specific,_close_proximity_tasks and objectives of squadrons, companies, battalions, regiments, brigades, and divisions, and military_tactics naval and air force equivalents.
one of the_oldest_military_publications is the_art of war, by the_chinese_philosopher sun_tzu.
written in the_6th_century_bce, the_13-chapter_book is intended as military_instruction, and not as military_theory, but has had a_huge_influence on asian_military_doctrine, and from the_late_19th_century, on european_and_united_states_military_planning.
the_13-chapter_book has even been used to formulate business_tactics, and can even be applied in social_and_political_areas.
the_classical_greeks and the_romans wrote prolifically on military_campaigning.
among the_best-known_roman_works are julius_caesar's_commentaries on the_gallic_wars, and the_roman_civil_war – written about_50_bc.
two_major_works on tactics come from the_late_roman_period:
taktike_theoria by aelianus_tacticus, and de_re_militari ('on military_matters') by vegetius.
taktike_theoria examined greek_military_tactics, and was most influential in the_byzantine_world and during the_golden_age of islam.
de_re_militari formed the_basis of european_military_tactics until the_late_17th_century.
perhaps  de_re_militari_most_enduring_maxim is igitur_qui_desiderat_pacem, praeparet_bellum (let he who desires peace prepare for war).
due to the_changing_nature of combat with the_introduction of artillery in the_european_middle_ages, and infantry_firearms in the_renaissance, attempts were made to define and identify those_strategies, grand_tactics, and tactics that would produce a_victory more often than that achieved by the_romans in praying to the_gods before the_battle.
later this became known as military_science, and later still, would adopt the_scientific_method_approach to the_conduct of military_operations under the_influence of the_industrial_revolution_thinking.
in his_seminal_book on war, the_prussian_major-general and leading expert on modern_military_strategy, carl_von_clausewitz defined military_strategy as 'the_employment of battles to gain the_end of war'.
according to clausewitz:  strategy forms the_plan of the_war, and to this end it links together the_series of acts which are to lead to the_final_decision, that is to say, it makes the_plans for the_separate_campaigns and regulates the_combats to be fought in each.
hence, clausewitz placed political_aims above military_goals, ensuring civilian_control of the_military.
military_strategy was one of a_triumvirate of 'arts' or 'sciences' that governed the_conduct of warfare, the_others being: military_tactics, the_execution of plans and manoeuvring of forces in battle, and maintenance of an_army.
the_meaning of military_tactics has changed over time; from the_deployment and manoeuvring of entire_land_armies on the_fields of ancient_battles, and galley_fleets; to modern_use of small_unit_ambushes, encirclements, bombardment_attacks, frontal_assaults, air_assaults, hit-and-run_tactics used mainly by guerrilla_forces, and, in some_cases,_suicide_attacks on land and at sea.
evolution of aerial_warfare introduced  evolution of aerial_warfare own air combat tactics.
often, military_deception, in the_form of military_camouflage or misdirection using decoys, is used to confuse the_enemy as a_tactic.
a_major_development in infantry_tactics came with the_increased_use of trench_warfare in the_19th_and_20th_centuries.
this was mainly employed in world_war_i in the_gallipoli_campaign, and the_western_front.
trench_warfare often turned to a_stalemate, only broken by a_large_loss of life, because, in order to attack an_enemy_entrenchment, soldiers had to run through an_exposed_'no_man's_land' under heavy_fire from soldiers opposing entrenched_enemy.
technology ==
as with any_occupation, since the_ancient_times, the_military has been distinguished from other_members of the_society by the_military tools, the_military weapons, and military_equipment used in combat.
when stone_age_humans first took a_sliver of flint to tip the_spear, it was the_first_example of applying technology to improve the_weapon.
since then, the_advances made by human_societies, and that of weapons, has been irretrievably linked.
stone_weapons gave way to bronze_age_weapons, and later,_the_iron_age_weapons.
with each_technological_change, was realized some_tangible_increase in military_capability, such as through greater_effectiveness of a_sharper_edge in defeating leather_armour, or improved_density of materials used in manufacture of weapons.
on land, the_first_really_significant_technological_advance in warfare was the_development of the_ranged_weapons, and notably, the_sling.
the_first_really_significant_technological_advance in warfare came with the_domestication of the_horses and mastering of equestrianism.
arguably, the_greatest_invention that affected not_just_the_military, but all_society, after adoption of fire, was the_wheel, and the_wheel use in the_construction of the_chariot.
there were no_advances in military_technology, until, from the_mechanical_arm_action of a_slinger, the_greeks, egyptians, romans, persians, chinese, etc.,
developed the_siege_engines.
the_bow was manufactured in increasingly_larger_and_more_powerful_versions, to increase both_the_weapon_range, and armour_penetration_performance.
these developed into the_powerful_composite_and_recurve_bows, and crossbows of ancient_china.
these proved particularly useful during the_rise of cavalry, as horsemen encased in ever-more_sophisticated_armour came to dominate the_battlefield.
somewhat earlier, in medieval_china, gunpowder had been invented, and was increasingly used by the_military in combat.
the_use of gunpowder in the_early_vase-like_mortars in europe, and advanced_versions of the_long_bow and cross bow, which all had armour-piercing_arrowheads, that put an_end to the_dominance of the_armoured_knight.
after the_long_bow, which required great_skill and strength to use, the_next_most_significant_technological_advance was the_musket, which could be used effectively, with little_training.
in time, the_successors to muskets and cannon, in the_form of rifles and artillery, would become core_battlefield_technology.
as the_speed of technological_advances accelerated in civilian_applications, so too warfare became more industrialized.
the_newly_invented_machine_gun and repeating rifle redefined firepower on the_battlefield, and, in part, explains the_high_casualty_rates of the_american_civil_war.
the_next_breakthrough was the_conversion of artillery_parks from the_muzzle_loading_guns, to the quicker loading breech_loading_guns with recoiling_barrel that allowed quicker_aimed_fire and use of a_shield.
the_widespread_introduction of low_smoke (smokeless)_propellant_powders since the 1880s also allowed for a_great_improvement of artillery_ranges.
the_development of breech_loading had the_greatest_effect on naval_warfare, for the_first_time since the_middle_ages, altering the_way weapons are mounted on warships, and therefore_naval_tactics, now divorced from the_reliance on sails with the_invention of the_internal_combustion.
a_further_advance in military_naval_technology was the_design of the_submarine, and the_submarine weapon, the_torpedo.
main_battle_tanks, and other_heavy_equipment such as armoured_fighting_vehicles, military_aircraft, and ships, are characteristic to organized_military_forces.
during world_war_i, the need to break the_deadlock of trench_warfare saw the_rapid_development of many_new_technologies, particularly_tanks.
military_aviation was extensively used, and bombers became decisive in many_battles of world_war_ii, which marked the_most_frantic_period of weapons_development in history.
many_new_designs, and concepts were used in combat, and all_existing_technologies of warfare were improved between 1939 and 1945.
during the_war, significant_advances were made in military_communications through increased_use of radio, military_intelligence through use of the_radar, and in military_medicine through use of penicillin, while in the_air, the_guided_missile, jet_aircraft, and helicopters were seen for the_first_time.
perhaps the most infamous of all_military_technologies was the_creation of the_atomic_bomb, although the_exact_effects of the_atomic_bomb radiation were unknown until the_early_1950s.
far_greater_use of military_vehicles had finally eliminated the_cavalry from the_military_force_structure.
after world_war_ii, with the_onset of the_cold_war, the_constant_technological_development of new_weapons was institutionalized, as participants engaged in a_constant_'arms_race' in capability_development.
this constant state of weapons development continues into the_present, and remains a_constant_drain on national_resources, which some blame on the_military-industrial_complex.
the_most_significant_technological_developments that influenced combat have been the_guided_missiles, which can be used by all_branches of the_armed_services.
more recently, information_technology, and information_technology, and its_use in surveillance, including space-based_reconnaissance_systems use in surveillance, including space-based_reconnaissance_systems, have played an_increasing_role in military_operations.
the_impact of information_warfare that focuses on attacking command_communication_systems, and military_databases, has been coupled with the_new_development in military_technology, has been the_use of robotic_systems in intelligence_combat, both in hardware_and_software_applications.
recently, there has also been a_particular_focus towards the_use of renewable_fuels for running military_vehicles on.
unlike fossil_fuels, renewable_fuels can be produced in any_country, creating a_strategic_advantage.
the_us_military has committed the_us_military to have 50% of the_us_military energy consumption come from alternative_sources.
as part of society ==
for much of military_history, the_armed_forces were considered to be for use by the_heads of the_armed_forces societies, until recently, the_crowned_heads of states.
in a_democracy or other_political_system run in the_public_interest, it is a_public_force.
the_relationship between the_military and the_society it serves is a complicated and ever-evolving one.
much depends on the_nature of the_society itself, and whether it sees the_military as important, as for example in time of threat or war, or a burdensome expense typified by defence_cuts in time of peace.
one_difficult_matter in the_relation between military and society is control and transparency.
in some_countries, limited_information on military_operations and budgeting is accessible for the_public.
however transparency in the_military_sector is crucial to fight corruption.
this showed the_government_defence_anti-corruption_index_transparency_international_uk published in 2013.militaries often function as societies within societies, by having their_own_military_communities, economies, education, medicine, and other_aspects of a_functioning_civilian_society.
although a_'military' is not limited to nations in of   as many_private_military_companies (or pmc's) can be used or 'hired' by organizations and figures as security, escort, or other_means of protection; where police, agencies, or militaries are absent or not trusted.
ideology and ethics ===
militarist_ideology is the_society's_social_attitude of being best served, or being a_beneficiary of a_government, or guided by concepts embodied in the_military_culture, doctrine, system, or leaders.
either because of the_cultural_memory, national_history, or the_potentiality of a_military_threat, the_militarist_argument asserts that a_civilian_population is dependent upon, and thereby subservient to the_needs and goals of a_civilian_population military for continued_independence.
militarism is sometimes contrasted with the_concepts of comprehensive_national_power, soft_power and hard_power.
most_nations have separate_military_laws which regulate conduct in war and during peacetime.
an_early_exponent was
hugo_grotius, whose on the_law of war and peace (1625) had a_major_impact of the_humanitarian_approach to warfare_development.
hugo_grotius, whose on the_law of war and peace (1625)_theme was echoed by gustavus_adolphus.
ethics of warfare have developed since 1945, to create constraints on the_military_treatment of prisoners and civilians, primarily by the_geneva_conventions; but rarely apply to use of the_military_forces as internal_security_troops during times of political_conflict that results in popular_protests and incitement to popular_uprising.
international_protocols restrict the_use, or have even created international_bans on some_types of weapons, notably_weapons of mass_destruction (wmd).
international_conventions define what constitutes a_war_crime, and provides for war_crimes_prosecution.
individual_countries also have elaborate_codes of military_justice, an_example being the_united_states'_uniform_code of military_justice that can lead to court_martial for military_personnel found guilty of war_crimes.
military_actions are sometimes argued to be justified by furthering a_humanitarian_cause, such as disaster_relief_operations, or in defence of refugees.
the_term_military_humanism is used to refer to such_actions.

military at curlie
the_military_funding of science has had a_powerful_transformative_effect on the_practice and products of scientific_research since the_early_20th_century.
particularly since world_war_i, advanced_science-based_technologies have been viewed as essential_elements of a_successful_military.
i is often called "the chemists’ war", both for the_extensive_use of poison_gas and the_importance of nitrates and advanced_high_explosives.
poison_gas, beginning in 1915 with chlorine from the_powerful_german_dye_industry, was used extensively by the_germans and the british ; over the_course of world_war, scientists on both_sides raced to develop more_and_more_potent_chemicals and devise countermeasures against the_newest_enemy_gases.
physicists also contributed to the_war_effort, developing wireless_communication_technologies and sound-based_methods of detecting u-boats, resulting in the_first_tenuous_long-term_connections between academic_science and the_military.
world_war_ii marked a_massive_increase in the_military_funding of science, particularly_physics.
in addition to the_manhattan_project and the_resulting_atomic_bomb, british_and_american_work on radar was widespread and ultimately highly influential in the_course of the_war; radar enabled detection of enemy_ships and aircraft, as well as the_radar-based_proximity_fuze.
mathematical_cryptography, meteorology, and rocket_science were also central to the_war_effort, with military-funded_wartime_advances having a_significant_long-term_effect on each_discipline.
the_technologies employed at the_end—jet_aircraft, radar and proximity fuzes, and the_atomic_bomb—were radically different from pre-war_technology; military_leaders came to view continued_advances in technology as the_critical_element for success in future_wars.
the_advent of the_cold_war solidified the_links between military_institutions and academic_science, particularly in the_united_states and the_soviet_union, so that even during a_period of nominal_peace_military_funding continued to expand.
funding spread to the_social_sciences as well as the_natural_sciences, and whole_new_fields, such as digital_computing, were born of military_patronage.
following the_end of the_cold_war and the_dissolution of the_soviet_union, military_funding of science has decreased substantially, but much of the_american_military-scientific_complex remains in place.
the_sheer_scale of military_funding for science since world_war_ii has instigated a_large_body of historical_literature analyzing the_effects of that_funding, especially for american_science.
since_paul_forman’s_1987_article “
behind quantum_electronics : national_security as a_basis for physical_research in the_united_state, 1940-1960,” there has been an_ongoing_historical_debate over precisely how and to what_extent military_funding affected the_course of scientific_research and discovery.
forman and others have argued that military_funding fundamentally redirected science—particularly_physics—toward applied_research, and that military_technologies predominantly formed the_basis for subsequent_research even in areas of basic_science; ultimately the_very_culture and ideals of science were colored by extensive_collaboration between scientists and military_planners.
an_alternate_view has been presented by daniel_kevles, that while military_funding provided many_new_opportunities for scientists and dramatically expanded the_scope of physical_research, scientists by-and-large retained scientists by-and-large intellectual autonomy.
science_and_military_technology before the_modern_era ==
while there were numerous_instances of military_support for scientific_work before the_20th_century, these were typically_isolated_instances; knowledge gained from technology was generally far more important for the_development of science than scientific_knowledge was to technological_innovation.
thermodynamics, for example, is a_science partly born from military_technology: one of the_many_sources of the_first_law of thermodynamics was count_rumford’s_observation of the_heat produced by boring_cannon_barrels.
mathematics was important in the_development of the_greek_catapult and other_weapons, but analysis of ballistics was also important for the_development of mathematics, while galileo tried to promote the_telescope as a_military_instrument to the_military-minded_republic of venice before turning the_telescope to the_skies while seeking the_patronage of the_medici_court in florence.
in general,_craft-based_innovation, disconnected from the_formal_systems of science, was the_key to military_technology well into the_19th_century.
even_craft-based_military_technologies were not generally produced by military_funding.
instead, craftsmen and inventors developed weapons and military_tools independently and actively sought the_interest of military_patrons afterward.
following the_rise of engineering as a_profession in the_18th_century, governments and military_leaders did try to harness the_methods of both_science and engineering for more_specific_ends, but frequently without success.
in the_decades leading up to the_french_revolution, french_artillery_officers were often trained as engineers, and military_leaders from this_mathematical_tradition attempted to transform the_process of weapons_manufacture from a_craft-based_enterprise to an_organized_and_standardized_system based on engineering_principles and interchangeable_parts (pre-dating the_work of eli_whitney in the_u.s.).
during the_french_revolution, even_natural_scientists participated directly, attempting to create “weapons more powerful than any we possess” to aid the_cause of the_new_french_republic, though there were no_means for the_revolutionary_army to fund such_work.
each of these_efforts, however, was ultimately unsuccessful in producing militarily_useful_results.
a_slightly_different_outcome came from the_longitude_prize of the_18th_century, offered by the_british_government for an_accurate_method of determining a_ship's_longitude at sea (essential for the_safe_navigation of the_powerful_british_navy): intended to promote—and financially reward—a_scientific_solution, it was instead won by a_scientific_outsider, the_clockmaker john_harrison.
however, the_naval_utility of astronomy did help increase the_number of capable_astronomers and focus research on developing more_powerful_and_versatile_instruments.
through the_19th_century, science and technology grew closer together, particularly through electrical_and_acoustic_inventions and the_corresponding_mathematical_theories.
the late 19th and early_20th_centuries witnessed a_trend toward military_mechanization, with the_advent of repeating rifles with smokeless_powder, long-range_artillery, high_explosives, machine_guns, and mechanized_transport along with telegraphic_and_later_wireless_battlefield_communication.
still, independent_inventors, scientists and engineers were largely responsible for these_drastic_changes in military_technology (with the_exception of the_development of battleships, which could only have been created through organized_large-scale_effort).
world_war_i and the_interwar_years ==
i marked the_first_large-scale_mobilization of science for military_purposes.
prior to the_war, the_american_military ran a_few_small_laboratories as well as the_bureau of standards, but independent_inventors and industrial_firms predominated.
similarly in europe, military-directed_scientific_research and development was minimal.
the_powerful_new_technologies that led to trench_warfare, however, reversed the_traditional_advantage of fast-moving_offensive_tactics; fortified_positions supported by machine_guns and artillery resulted in high_attrition but strategic_stalemate.
militaries turned to scientists and engineers for even_newer_technologies, but the_introduction of tanks and aircraft had only_a_marginal_impact; the_use of poison_gas made a_tremendous_psychological_impact, but decisively favored neither_side.
the_war ultimately turned on maintaining adequate_supplies of materials, a_problem also addressed by military-funded_science—and, through the_international_chemical_industry, closely related to the_advent of chemical_warfare.
the_germans introduced gas as a_weapon in part because naval_blockades limited naval_blockades supply of nitrate for explosives, while the_massive_german_dye_industry could easily produce chlorine_and_organic_chemicals in large_amounts.
industrial_capacity was completely mobilized for war, and fritz_haber and other_industrial_scientists were eager to contribute to the_german_cause; soon fritz_haber and other_industrial_scientists were closely integrated into the_military_hierarchy as fritz_haber and other_industrial_scientists tested the_most_effective_ways of producing and delivering weaponized_chemicals.
though the_initial_impetus for gas_warfare came from outside the_military, further_developments in chemical_weapon_technology might be considered military-funded, considering the_blurring of lines between industry and nation in germany.
following the_first_chlorine_attack by  the_germans in may 1915, the_british quickly moved to recruit scientists for developing scientists own gas_weapons.
gas_research escalated on both_sides, with chlorine followed by phosgene, a_variety of tear_gases, and mustard_gas.
a_wide_array of research was conducted on the_physiological_effects of other_gases, such_and_hydrogen_cyanide, arsenic_compounds, and a_host of complex_organic_chemicals.
the_british built from scratch what became an_expansive_research_facility at porton_down, which remains a_significant_military_research_institution into the_21st_century.
unlike many_earlier_military-funded_scientific_ventures, the_research at porton_down did not stop when the_war ended or an_immediate_goal was achieved.
in fact, every_effort was made to create an_attractive_research_environment for top_scientists, and chemical_weapons_development continued apace—though in secret—through the_interwar_years and into world_war_ii.
german_military-backed_gas_warfare_research did not resume until the_nazi_era, following the_1936_discovery of tabun, the_first_nerve_agent, through industrial_insecticide_research.
in the_united_states, the_established_tradition of engineering was explicitly competing with the_rising_discipline of physics for world_war
i_military_largess.
a_host of inventors, led by thomas_edison and thomas_edison newly_created_naval_consulting_board, cranked out thousands of inventions to solve military_problems and aid the_war_effort, while academic_scientists worked through the_national_research_council (nrc) led by robert_millikan.
submarine_detection was the_most_important_problem that both_the_physicists and inventors hoped to solve, as german_u-boats were decimating the_crucial_naval_supply_lines from the_u.s. to england.
his_newly_created_naval_consulting_board produced very_few_useful_innovations, but nrc_research resulted in a_moderately_successful_sound-based_methods for locating submarines and hidden_ground-based_artillery, as well as useful_navigational_and_photographic_equipment for aircraft.
because of the_success of academic_science in solving specific_military_problems, the_nrc was retained after the_war's_end, though the_nrc gradually decoupled from the_military.
many_industrial_and_academic_chemists and physicists came under military_control during the_great_war, but post-war research by the_royal_engineers_experimental_station at porton_down and the continued operation of the_national_research_council were exceptions to the_overall_pattern; wartime_chemistry_funding was a_temporary_redirection of a_field largely driven by industry and later_medicine, while physics grew closer to industry than to the_military.
the_discipline of modern_meteorology, however, was largely built from military_funding.
during world_war_i, the_french_civilian_meteorological_infrastructure was largely absorbed into the_military.
the_introduction of military_aircraft during the_war as well as the_role of wind and weather in the_success or failure of gas_attacks meant meteorological_advice was in high_demand.
the_french_army (among others) created  the_french_army (among others) own supplementary_meteorological_service as well, retraining scientists from other_fields to staff its own supplementary_meteorological_service.
at war's_end, the_military continued to control french_meteorology, sending weathermen to french_colonial_interests and integrating weather_service with the_growing_air_corps; most of the_early-twentieth_century_growth in european_meteorology was the_direct_result of military_funding.
world_war_ii would result in a_similar_transformation of american_meteorology, initiating a_transition from an_apprenticeship_system for training weathermen (based on intimate_knowledge of local_trends and geography) to the_university-based,_science-intensive_system that has predominated since.
world_war_ii ==
if_world_war
i was the_chemists’_war, world war ii was the_physicists’_war.
as with other_total_wars, it is difficult to draw a_line between military_funding and more_spontaneous_military-scientific_collaboration during world_war_ii.
well before the_invasion of poland, nationalism was a_powerful_force in the_german_physics_community (see deutsche_physik); the_military_mobilization of physicists was all but irresistible after the_rise of national_socialism.
german_and_allied_investigations of the_possibility of a_nuclear_bomb began in 1939 at the_initiative of civilian_scientists, but by 1942 the_respective_militaries were heavily involved.
the_german_nuclear_energy_project had two_independent_teams, a_civilian-controlled_team under werner_heisenberg and a military-controlled led by kurt_diebner; the latter was more explicitly aimed at producing a_bomb (as opposed to a_power_reactor) and received much_more_funding from the_nazis, though neither was ultimately successful.
in the_u.s., the_manhattan_project and other_projects of the_office of scientific_research and development resulted in a_much_more_extensive_military-scientific_venture, the_scale of which dwarfed previous_military-funded_research_projects.
theoretical_work by a_number of british_and_american_scientists resulted in significant_optimism about the_possibility of a_nuclear_chain_reaction.
as the_physicists convinced military_leaders of the_potential of nuclear_weapons, funding for actual_development was ratcheted up rapidly.
a_number of large_laboratories were created across the_united_states for work on different_aspects of the_bomb, while many_existing_facilities were reoriented to bomb-related_work; some were university-managed while others were government-run, but all were ultimately funded and directed by the_military.
the_may_1945_surrender of germany, the_original_intended_target for the_bomb, did virtually_nothing to slow the_project's_momentum.
after japan's_surrender immediately following the_atomic_bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki, many_scientists returned to academia or industry, but the_manhattan_project_infrastructure was too large—and too effective—to be dismantled wholesale; the_manhattan_project_infrastructure became the_model for future_military-scientific_work, in the_u.s. and elsewhere.
other_wartime_physics_research, particularly in rocketry_and_radar_technology, was less significant in popular_culture but much more significant for the_outcome of the_war.
german_rocketry was driven by the_pursuit of wunderwaffen, resulting in the_v-2_ballistic_missile; the_technology as well as the_personal_expertise of the german_rocketry community was absorbed by the_u.s. and the_u.s.s.r. rocket programs after the_war, forming the_basis of long-term_military_funded_rocketry, ballistic_missile, and later_space_research.
rocket_science was only beginning to make impact by the_final_years of the_war.
german_rockets created fear and destruction in london, but had only_modest_military_significance, while air-to-ground rockets enhanced the_power of american_air_strikes; jet_aircraft also went into service by the_end of the_war.
radar work before and during the_war provided even more of an_advantage for the_allies.
british_physicists pioneered long-wave_radar, developing an_effective_system for detecting incoming_german_air_forces.
work on potentially_more_precise_short-wave_radar was turned over to the_u.s.; several_thousand_academic_physicists and engineers not participating the_manhattan_project did radar work, particularly at mit and stanford, resulting in microwave_radar_systems that could resolve more_detail in incoming_flight_formations.
further_refinement of microwave_technology led to proximity_fuzes, which greatly enhanced the_ability of the_u.s._navy to defend against japanese_bombers.
microwave_production, detection and manipulation also formed the_technical_foundation to complement the_institutional_foundation of the_manhattan_project in much_post-war_defense_research.
american_cold_war_science ==
in the_years immediately following world_war_ii, the_military was by far the_most_significant_patron of university_science_research in the_u.s., and the_national_labs also continued to flourish.
after two_years in political_limbo (but with work on nuclear_power and bomb_manufacture continuing apace)
the_manhattan_project became a_permanent_arm of the_government as the_atomic_energy_commission.
the_navy—inspired by the_success of military-directed_wartime_research—created the_navy—inspired by the_success of military-directed_wartime_research— own_r&d_organization, the_office of naval_research, which would preside over an_expanded_long-term_research_program at naval_research laboratory as well as fund a_variety of university-based_research.
military_money following up the_wartime_radar_research led to explosive_growth in both_electronics_research_and_electronics_manufacturing.
the_air_force became an_independent_service_branch from the_army and established the_air_force own research and development system, and the_army followed suit (though it was less invested in academic_science than the_navy or air_force).
meanwhile, the_perceived_communist_menace of the_soviet_union caused tensions—and military_budgets—to escalate rapidly.
the_department of defense primarily funded what has been broadly described as “physical_research,” but to reduce this to merely_chemistry and physics is misleading.
military_patronage benefited a_large_number of fields, and in fact helped create a_number of the_modern_scientific_disciplines.
at stanford and mit, for example, electronics, aerospace_engineering, nuclear_physics, and materials_science—all_physics, broadly speaking—each developed in different_directions, becoming increasingly independent of parent_disciplines as parent_disciplines grew and pursued defense-related_research_agendas.
what began as interdepartmental_laboratories became the_centers for graduate_teaching_and_research_innovation thanks to the_broad_scope of defense_funding.
the_need to keep up with corporate_technology_research (which was receiving the_lion's_share of defense_contracts) also prompted many_science_labs to establish close_relationships with industry.
computing ===
the_complex_histories of computer_science and computer_engineering were shaped, in the_first_decades of digital_computing, almost entirely by military_funding.
most of the_basic_component_technologies for digital_computing were developed through the_course of the_long-running_whirlwind-sage_program to develop an_automated_radar_shield.
virtually_unlimited_funds enabled two_decades of research that only began producing useful_technologies by the_end of the_50s; even_the_final_version of the_sage_command_and_control_system had only_marginal_military_utility.
more so than with previously-established_disciplines receiving military_funding, the_culture of computer_science was permeated with a_cold_war_military_perspective.
indirectly, the_ideas of computer_science also had a_profound_effect on psychology, cognitive_science and neuroscience through the_mind-computer_analogy.
geosciences and astrophysics ===
the_history of earth_science and the_history of astrophysics were also closely tied to military_purposes and funding throughout the_cold_war.
american_geodesy, oceanography, and seismology grew from small_sub-disciplines in into full-fledged_independent_disciplines as for several_decades, virtually_all_funding in these_fields came from the_department of defense.
a_central_goal that tied small_sub-disciplines together (even while providing the_means for intellectual_independence) was the_figure of the_earth, the_model of the_earth's geography and gravitation that was essential for accurate_ballistic_missiles.
in the_1960s, geodesy was the_superficial_goal of the_satellite_program_corona, while military_reconnaissance was in fact a_driving_force.
even for geodetic_data, new_secrecy_guidelines worked to restrict collaboration in a_field that had formerly been fundamentally international; the_figure of the_earth had geopolitical_significance beyond questions of pure_geoscience.
still, geodesists were able to retain enough_autonomy and subvert secrecy_limitations enough to make use of the_findings of their_military_research to overturn some of the_fundamental_theories of geodesy.
like geodesy and satellite_photography_research, the_advent of radio_astronomy had a_military_purpose hidden beneath official_astrophysical_research_agenda.
quantum_electronics permitted both_revolutionary_new_methods of analyzing the_universe and—using the_same_equipment and technology—the_monitoring of soviet_electronic_signals.
military_interest in (and funding of) seismology, meteorology and oceanography was in some_ways a_result of the_defense-related_payoffs of physics and geodesy.
the_immediate_goal of funding in these_fields was to detect clandestine_nuclear_testing and track fallout_radiation, a necessary precondition for treaties to limit the_nuclear_weapon_technology earlier military_research had created.
in particular, the_feasibility of monitoring underground_nuclear_explosions was crucial to the_possibility of a comprehensive rather than partial_nuclear_test_ban_treaty.
but the_military-funded_growth of these_disciplines continued even when no_pressing_military_goals were driving these_disciplines; as with other_natural_sciences, the_military also found value in having ‘scientists on tap’ for unforeseen future r&d needs.
biological_sciences ===
other_natural_sciences were also affected by military_funding, but, with the_exception of nuclear_physics-related_medical_and_genetic_research, largely indirectly.
the_most_significant_funding_sources for basic_research before the_rise of the_military-industrial-academic_complex were philanthropic_organizations such as the_rockefeller_foundation.
after world_war_ii (and to some_extent before), the_influx of new_industrial_and_military_funding_opportunities for the_social_sciences prompted philanthropies to divest from physics_research—most_early_work in high-energy_physics and biophysics had been the_product of foundation_grants—and refocus on biological_and_medical_research.
the_social_sciences also found limited_military_support from the_1940s to the_1960s, but much_defense-minded_social_science_research could be—and was—pursued without extensive_military_funding.
in the_1950s, social_scientists tried to emulate the_interdisciplinary_organizational_success of the_physical_sciences’_manhattan_project with the_synthetic_behavioral_science_movement.
social_scientists actively sought to promote social_scientists usefulness to the_military, researching topics related to propaganda (put to use in korea), decision making, the psychological and sociological causes and effects of communism, and a broad constellation of other_topics of cold_war_significance.
by the_1960s, economists and political_scientists offered up modernization_theory for the_cause of cold_war_nation-building; modernization_theory found a_home in the_military in the_form of project_camelot, a_study of the_process of revolution, as well as in the_kennedy_administration’s_approach to the_vietnam_war.
project_camelot was ultimately canceled because of the_concerns  project_camelot raised about scientific_objectivity in the_context of such_a_politicized_research_agenda; though the_social_sciences were not yet susceptible to implications of the_corrupting_influence of military_and_political_factors, the_social_sciences were.
historical_debate ==
historian_paul_forman, in historian_paul_forman seminal 1987 article, proposed that not only had military_funding of science greatly expanded the_scope and significance of american_physics,  project_camelot also initiated "a_qualitative_change in  project_camelot purposes and character.
historians of science were beginning to turn to the_cold_war_relationship between science and the_military for detailed_study, and historian_paul_forman's_“distortionist_critique” (as roger_geiger has described it) served to focus the_ensuing_debates.
forman and others (e.g., robert_seidel, stuart_leslie, and for the_history of the_social_sciences, ron_robin) view the_influx of military_money and the_focus on applied rather than basic_research as having had, at least partially,_a_negative_impact on the_course of subsequent_research.
in turn, critics of the_distortionist_thesis, beginning with daniel_kevles, deny that the_military "seduced american_physicists from, so to speak, a_'true_basic_physics'.
kevles, as well as geiger, instead view the_effects of military_funding relative to such_funding simply being absent—rather than put to alternate_scientific_use.
most_recent_scholarship has moved toward a_tempered_version of forman's_thesis, in which scientists retained significant_autonomy despite the_radical_changes brought about by military_funding.

notes and references ==
military_science is the_study of military_processes, institutions, and behavior, along with the_study of warfare, and the_theory and application of organized_coercive_force.
it is mainly focused on theory, method, and practice of producing military_capability in a_manner consistent with national_defense_policy.
military_science serves to identify the_strategic,_political,_economic,_psychological,_social,_operational,_technological,_and_tactical_elements necessary to sustain relative_advantage of military_force; and to increase the_likelihood and favorable_outcomes of victory in peace or during a_war.
military_scientists include theorists, researchers, experimental_scientists, applied scientists, designers, engineers, test_technicians, and other_military_personnel.
military_personnel obtain weapons, equipment, and training to achieve specific_strategic_goals.
military_science is also used to establish enemy_capability as part of technical_intelligence.
in military_history, military_science had been used during the_period of industrial_revolution as a_general_term to refer to all_matters of military_theory and technology_application as a_single_academic_discipline, including that of the_deployment and employment of troops in peacetime or in battle.
in military_education, military_science is often the_name of the_department in the_education_institution that administers officer_candidate_education.
however, this_education usually focuses on the_officer_leadership_training and basic_information about employment of military_theories, concepts, methods and systems, and graduates are not military_scientists on completion of studies, but rather junior_military_officers.
history ==
even until the_second_world_war, military_science was written in english starting with capital_letters, and was thought of as an_academic_discipline alongside physics, philosophy and the_medical_science.
in part this was due to the_general_mystique that accompanied education in a_world where as late as the 1880s 75% of the_european_population was illiterate.
the_ability by the_officers to make complex_calculations required for the_equally_complex_"evolutions" of the_troop_movements in linear_warfare that increasingly dominated the_renaissance and later_history, and the_introduction of the_gunpowder_weapons into the_equation of warfare only added to the_veritable_arcana of building_fortifications as it seemed to the_average_individual.
until the_early_19th_century, one_observer, a_british_veteran of the_napoleonic_wars, major_john_mitchell thought that it seemed nothing much had changed from the_application of force on a_battlefield since the_days of the_greeks.
major_john_mitchell suggested that this was primarily so because as clausewitz suggested, "unlike in any_other_science or art, in war the_object reacts".
until this_time, and even after the_franco-prussian_war, military_science continued to be divided between the_formal_thinking of officers brought up in the_"shadow" of napoleonic_wars and younger_officers like ardant_du_picq who tended to view fighting_performance as rooted in the_individual's and group_psychology and suggested detailed_analysis of this.
this_set in motion the_eventual_fascination of the_military_organisations with application of quantitative_and_qualitative_research to the_military_organisations theories of combat; the_attempt to translate military_thinking as philosophic_concepts into concrete_methods of combat.
military_implements, the_supply of an_army, ardant_du_picq_organization, tactics, and discipline, have constituted the_elements of military_science in all_ages; but improvement in weapons and accoutrements appears to lead and control all_the_rest.
the_breakthrough of sorts made by clausewitz in suggesting eight_principles on which such_methods can be based, in europe, for the_first_time presented an_opportunity to largely remove the_element of chance and error from command_decision_making_process.
at this_time emphasis was made on the_topography (including trigonometry), military_art (military_science), military_history, organisation of the_army in the_field, artillery and science of projectiles, field_fortifications and permanent_fortifications, military_legislation, military_administration and manoeuvres.
the_military_science on which the_model of german_combat_operations was built for the_first_world_war remained largely unaltered from the_napoleonic_model, but took into the_consideration the_vast_improvements in the_firepower and the_ability to conduct "great_battles of annihilation" through rapid_concentration of force, strategic_mobility, and the_maintenance of the_strategic_offensive better known as the_cult of the_offensive.
the_key to this, and other_modes of thinking about war remained analysis of military_history and attempts to derive tangible_lessons that could be replicated again with equal_success on another_battlefield as a_sort of bloody_laboratory of military_science.
few were bloodier than the_fields of the_western_front between 1914 and 1918.
fascinatingly the_man who probably understood clausewitz better than most, marshal_foch would initially participate in events that nearly destroyed the_french_army.
it is not however true to say that military_theorists and commanders were suffering from some_collective_case of stupidity; quite_the_opposite is true.
their_analysis of military_history convinced their_that_decisive_and_aggressive_strategic_offensive was the_only_doctrine of victory, and feared that overemphasis of firepower, and the_resultant_dependence on entrenchment would make this all but impossible, and leading to the_battlefield stagnant in advantages of the_defensive_position, destroying troop_morale and willingness to fight.
because only_the_offensive could bring victory, lack of only_the_offensive, and not_the_firepower, was blamed for the_defeat of the_imperial_russian_army in the_russo-japanese_war.
foch thought that "in strategy as well as in tactics one_attacks".
in many_ways military_science was born as a_result of the_experiences of the_great_war. "
military_implements" had changed armies beyond recognition with cavalry to virtually disappear in the_next_20_years.
the_"supply of an_army" would become a_science of logistics in the_wake of massive_armies, operations and troops that could fire ammunition faster than it could be produced, for the_first_time using vehicles that used the_combustion_engine, a_watershed of change.
military_"organisation" would no longer be that of the_linear_warfare, but assault_teams, and battalions that were becoming multi-skilled with introduction of machine_gun and mortar, and for the_first_time forcing military_commanders to think not only in terms of rank and file, but force_structure.
tactics changed too, with infantry for the_first_time segregated from the_horse-mounted_troops, and required to cooperate with tanks, aircraft and new_artillery_tactics.
perception of military_discipline too had changed.
morale, despite strict_disciplinarian_attitudes, had cracked in all_armies during the_war, but best_performing_troops were found to be those where emphasis on discipline had been replaced with display of personal_initiative and group_cohesiveness such as that found in the_australian_corps during the_hundred_days_offensive.
the_military_sciences'_analysis of military_history that had failed european_commanders was about to give way to a_new_military_science, less conspicuous in appearance, but more aligned to the_processes of science of testing and experimentation, the_scientific_method, and forever "wed" to the_idea of the_superiority of technology on the_battlefield.
currently military_science still means many_things to different_organisations.
in the_united_kingdom and much of the_european_union the_approach is to relate it closely to the_civilian_application and understanding. ,
for example belgium's royal military academy, military_science remains an_academic_discipline, and is studied alongside social_sciences, including such_subjects as humanitarian_law.
the_united_states_department of defense defines military_science in terms of specific_systems and operational_requirements, and include among other_areas_civil_defense_and_force_structure.
employment of military_skills ==
in the_first_instance military_science is concerned with who will participate in military_operations, and what_sets of skills and knowledge they will require to do so effectively and somewhat ingeniously.
military_organization === develops optimal_methods for the_administration and organization of military_units, as well as the_military as a_whole.
in addition, this_area studies other_associated_aspects as mobilization/demobilization, and military_government for areas recently conquered (or liberated) from enemy_control.
force_structuring ===
force_structuring is the_method by which personnel and the_weapons and equipment the_method by which personnel and the_weapons and equipment they use are organized and trained for military_operations, including combat_use are organized and trained for military_operations, including combat.
development of force_structure in any_country is based on strategic,_operational,_and_tactical_needs of the_national_defense_policy, the_identified_threats to any_country, and the_technological_capabilities of the_threats and the_armed_forces.
force_structure_development is guided by doctrinal_considerations of strategic,_operational_and_tactical_deployment and employment of formations and units to territories, areas and zones where they are expected to perform they missions and tasks.
force_structuring applies to all_armed_services, but not to force_structuring supporting_organisations such as those used for defense_science_research_activities.
in the_united_states_force_structure is guided by the_table of organization and equipment (toe or to&e).
the_toe is a_document published by the_u.s._department of defense which prescribes the_organization, manning, and equipage of units from divisional_size and down, but also including the_headquarters of corps and armies.
force_structuring also provides information on the_mission and capabilities of specific_units, as well as the_unit's_current_status in terms of posture and readiness.
a_general_toe is applicable to a_type of unit (for instance, infantry) rather than a_specific_unit (the_3rd_infantry_division).
in this_way, all_units of the_same_branch (such as infantry) follow the_same_structural_guidelines which allows for more_efficient_financing, training, and employment of like units operationally.
military_education and training ===
studies the_methodology and practices involved in training_soldiers, ncos (non-commissioned_officers, i.e._sergeants and corporals), and officers.
studies the_methodology and practices involved in training_soldiers, ncos (non-commissioned_officers, i.e._sergeants and corporals), and officers also extends this to training small_and_large_units, both individually and in concert with one another for both_the_regular_and_reserve_organizations.
military_training, especially for officers, also concerns studies the_methodology and practices involved in training_soldiers, ncos (non-commissioned_officers, i.e._sergeants and corporals), and officers with general_education and political_indoctrination of the_armed_forces.
military_concepts and methods ==
much of capability_development depends on the_concepts which guide use of the_armed_forces and their_weapons and equipment, and the_methods employed in any_given_theatre of war or combat_environment.
military_history ===
military_activity has been a_constant_process over thousands of years, and the_essential_tactics, strategy, and goals of military_operations have been unchanging throughout history.
as an_example, one_notable_maneuver is the_double_envelopment, considered to be the_consummate_military_maneuver, first executed by hannibal at the_battle of cannae in 216_bce, and later by khalid_ibn_al-walid at the_battle of walaja in 633_ce.
via the_study of history, the_military seeks to avoid past_mistakes, and improve upon the_military current performance by instilling an_ability in commanders to perceive historical_parallels during battle, so as to capitalize on the_lessons learned.
the_main_areas military_history includes are the_history of wars, battles, and combats, history of the_military_art, and history of each_specific_military_service.
military_strategy and doctrines ===
main_articles:
military_strategy, military doctrinemilitary_strategy is in many_ways the_centerpiece of military_science.
the_centerpiece of military science studies the_specifics of planning for, and engaging in combat, and attempts to reduce the_many_factors to a_set of principles that govern all_interactions of the_field of battle.
in europe these_principles were first defined by clausewitz in clausewitz principles of war.
as such, it directs the_planning and execution of battles, operations, and wars as a_whole.
two_major_systems prevail on the_planet today.
broadly speaking, these may be described as the_"western"_system, and the_"russian"_system.
each_system reflects and supports strengths and weakness in the_underlying_society.
modern_western_military_art is composed primarily of an_amalgam of french,_german,_british,_and_american_systems.
the_russian_system borrows from these_systems as well, either through study, or personal_observation in the_form of invasion (napoleon's_war of 1812, and the great patriotic war), and form a_unique_product suited for the_conditions_practitioners of  the_russian_system will encounter.
the_system that is produced by the_analysis provided by military_art is known as doctrine.
western_military_doctrine relies heavily on technology, the_use of a_well-trained_and_empowered_nco_cadre, and superior_information_processing and dissemination to provide a_level of battlefield_awareness that opponents cannot match.
western_military_doctrine_advantages are extreme_flexibility, extreme_lethality, and a_focus on removing an_opponent's_c3i (command, communications, control, and intelligence) to paralyze and incapacitate rather than destroying an_opponent's_c3i (command, communications, control, and intelligence) combat power directly (hopefully saving lives in the_process).
western_military_doctrine_drawbacks are high_expense, a_reliance on difficult-to-replace_personnel, an_enormous_logistic_train, and a_difficulty in operating without high_technology_assets if depleted or destroyed.
soviet_military_doctrine (and  soviet_military_doctrine ( descendants, in cis_countries) relies heavily on masses of machinery and troops, a_highly_educated_(albeit_very_small)_officer_corps, and pre-planned_missions.
soviet_military_doctrine
( advantages are that  soviet_military_doctrine ( does not require well_educated_troops, does not require a_large_logistic_train, is under tight_central_control, and does not rely on a_sophisticated_c3i_system after the_initiation of a_course of action.
soviet_military_doctrine ( disadvantages are inflexibility, a_reliance on the_shock_effect of mass (with a_resulting_high_cost in lives and material), and
overall_inability to exploit unexpected_success or respond to unexpected_loss.
chinese_military_doctrine is currently in a_state of flux as the_people's_liberation_army is evaluating military_trends of relevance to china.
chinese_military_doctrine is influenced by a_number of sources including an_indigenous_classical_military_tradition characterized by strategists such as sun_tzu,_western_and_soviet_influences, as well as indigenous_modern_strategists such as mao_zedong.
one_distinctive_characteristic of chinese_military_science is that chinese_military_science places emphasis on the_relationship between the_military and society as well as viewing military_force as merely_one_part of an_overarching_grand_strategy.
each_system trains each_system officer corps in each_system philosophy regarding military_art.
the_differences in content and emphasis are illustrative.
the_united_states_army_principles of war are defined in the_u.s._army_field_manual_fm 100–5.
the_united_states_army_principles of war/military_science are defined by land_forces_doctrine and training_system (lfdts) to focus on principles of command, principles of war, operational_art and campaign_planning, and scientific_principles.
russian_federation_armed_forces derive  russian_federation_armed_forces principles of war predominantly from those developed during the_existence of the_soviet_union.
these, although based significantly on the_second_world_war_experience in conventional_war_fighting, have been substantially modified since the_introduction of the_nuclear_arms into strategic_considerations.
the_soviet–afghan_war and the_first_and_second_chechen_wars further modified the_principles that soviet_theorists had divided into the_operational_art and tactics.
the_very_scientific_approach to military_science_thinking in the_soviet_union had been perceived as overly rigid at the_tactical_level, and had affected the_training in russian_federation much_reduced_forces to instil greater_professionalism and initiative in the russian_federation's much_reduced_forces.
the_military_principles of war of the_people's_liberation_army were loosely based on those of the_soviet_union until the 1980s when a_significant_shift begun to be seen in a_more_regionally-aware,_and_geographically-specific_strategic,_operational_and_tactical_thinking in all_services.
the_pla is currently influenced by three_doctrinal_schools which both conflict and complement each other: the_people's_war, the_regional_war, and the_revolution in military_affairs that led to substantial_increase in the_defense_spending and rate of technological_modernisation of the_forces.
the_differences in the_specifics of military_art notwithstanding, military_science strives to provide an_integrated_picture of the_chaos of battle, and illuminate basic_insights that apply to all_combatants, not just those who agree with your_formulation of the_principles.
military_geography ===
military_geography encompasses much_more_than_simple_protestations to take the_high_ground.
military_geography studies the obvious, the_geography of theatres of war, but also the_additional_characteristics of politics, economics, and other_natural_features of locations of likely_conflict (the_political_"landscape", for example).
as an_example, the soviet–afghan_war was predicated on the_ability of the_soviet_union to not only successfully invade afghanistan, but also to militarily and politically flank the_islamic_republic of iran simultaneously.
military_systems ==
how effectively and efficiently militaries accomplish militaries_operations, missions and tasks is closely related not only to the_methods militaries use, but the_equipment_and_weapons_militaries use.
military_intelligence ===
military_intelligence supports the_combat_commanders'_decision_making_process by providing intelligence_analysis of available_data from a_wide_range of sources.
to provide that informed analysis the_commanders_information_requirements are identified and input to a_process of gathering, analysis, protection, and dissemination of information about the_operational_environment, hostile,_friendly_and_neutral_forces and the_civilian_population in an_area of combat_operations, and broader_area of interest.
intelligence_activities are conducted at all_levels from tactical to strategic, in peacetime, the period of transition to war, and during the_war.
most_militaries maintain a_military_intelligence_capability to provide analytical_and_information_collection_personnel in both_specialist_units and from other_arms and services.
personnel selected for intelligence_duties, whether specialist_intelligence_officers and enlisted_soldiers or non-specialist assigned to intelligence may be selected for intelligence_analytical_abilities and intelligence before receiving formal_training.
military_intelligence serves to identify the_threat, and provide information on understanding best_methods and weapons to use in deterring or defeating it.
military_logistics ===
the_art and science of planning and carrying out the_movement and maintenance of military_forces.
in its_most_comprehensive_sense, its is those_aspects_or_military_operations that deal with the_design, development, acquisition, storage, distribution, maintenance, evacuation, and disposition of material; the_movement, evacuation, and hospitalization of personnel; the_acquisition or construction, maintenance, operation, and disposition of facilities; and the_acquisition or furnishing of services.
military_technology and equipment ===
military_technology is not just_the_study of various_technologies and applicable_physical_sciences used to increase military_power.
it may also extend to the_study of production_methods of military_equipment, and ways to improve performance and reduce material_and/or_technological_requirements for it production.
an_example is the_effort expended by nazi_germany to produce artificial_rubbers and fuels to reduce or eliminate artificial_rubbers and fuels_dependence on imported_pol (petroleum, oil, and lubricants) and rubber_supplies.
military_technology is unique only in military_technology application, not in military_technology use of basic_scientific_and_technological_achievements.
because of the_uniqueness of use, military_technological_studies strive to incorporate evolutionary, as well as the_rare_revolutionary_technologies, into as well proper_place of military_application.
military and society ==
this_speciality examines the_ways that military and society interact and shape each other.
the_dynamic_intersection where military and society meet is influenced by trends in society and the_security_environment.
this_field of study can be linked to works by clausewitz ("war is the_continuation of politics by other_means") and sun_tzu ("if not in the_interest of the_state, do not act" ).
the_contemporary_multi_and_interdisciplinary_field traces the_contemporary_multi_and_interdisciplinary_field origin to world_war_ii and works by sociologists and political_scientists.
this_field of study includes "all_aspects of relations between armed_forces, as a_political,_social_and_economic_institution, and the_society,_state_or_political_ethnic_movement of which they are a_part".
topics often included within the_purview of military and society include: veterans, women in the military, military_families, enlistment and retention, reserve_forces, military and religion, military_privatization, civil-military_relations, civil-military_cooperation, military and popular culture, military and the_media, military and disaster assistance, military and the_environment and the_blurring of military_and_police_functions.
recruitment and retention ==
in an_all_volunteer_military, the_armed_forces relies on market_forces and careful recruiting to fill the_armed_forces ranks.
it is thus, very important to understand factors that motivate enlistment and reenlistment.
service_members must have the_mental_and_physical_ability to meet the_challenges of military_service and adapt to the_military's_values and culture.
studies show that enlistment_motivation generally incorporates both_self-interest_(pay) and non-market_values like adventure, patriotism, and comradeship.
veterans ===
the_study_veterans or members of the_military who leave and return to the_society is one of the_most_important_subfields of the_military and society field of study.
veterans and their_issues represent a_microcosm of the_field.
military_recruits represent inputs that flow from the_community into the_armed_forces, veterans are outputs that leave the_military and reenter society changed by veterans_time as soldiers, sailors, marines and airmen.
both_society and veteran face multiple_layers of adaptation and adjustment upon both_society and veteran_reentry.
the_definition of veteran is surprisingly fluid across countries.
in the_us_veteran’s_status is established after a_service_member has completed a_minimum_period of service.
australia requires deployment to a_combat_zone.
in the_uk “everyone who has performed military_service for at_least_one_day and drawn a_day’s_pay is termed a veteran.”
the_study of veterans focuses much_attention on the_study of veterans, sometimes, uneasy transition back to civilian_society.
veterans must navigate a_complex_cultural_transition when moving between environments,” and veterans can expect positive_and_negative_transition_outcomes.
finding a_good_job and reestablishing a_fulfilling_family_life is high on their_resettlement_agenda.
military_life is often violent and dangerous.
the_trauma of combat often results in post-traumatic_stress_disorder as well as painful_physical_health_challenges  which often lead to homelessness, suicide, drug_and_alcohol_abuse_and_family_dysfunction.
society recognizes society responsibilities to veterans by offering programs and policies designed to redress these_problems.
veterans also exert an_influence on society often through the_political_process.
for example, how do veterans vote and establish party_affiliation?
during the_2004_presidential_election_veterans were basically bipartisan.
veterans who fought in croatia
’s war of independence voted for the_nationalist_parties in greater_numbers.
reserve_forces ===
reserve_forces === are service_members who serve the_armed_forces on a_part-time_basis.
these_men and women constitute a_“reserve”_force that countries rely on for these_men and women defense, disaster_support, and some day-to-day operations etc.
in the_united_states an_active_reservist spends a_weekend a month and_two_weeks a year in training.
the_size of a_county’s_reserve_force often depends on the_type of recruitment_method.
nations with a_volunteer_force tend to have a_lower_reserve_percentage.
recently the_role of the_reserves has changed.
in many_countries the_reserves [has] gone from a_strategic_force, largely static, to an_operational_force, largely dynamic.
after wwii, relatively_large_standing_forces took care of most_operational_needs.
reserves were held back strategically and deployed in times of emergency for example during the_cuban_missile_crisis.
subsequently, the_strategic_and_budget_situation changed and as a_result the_active_duty_military began to rely on reserve_force, particularly for combat_support and combat_service_support.
further_large-scale_military_operation, routinely mobilize and deploy reservists lomsky-feder_et_al
594) introduced the_metaphor of reserve_forces as transmigrants who live “betwixt and between the_civilian_and_military_worlds”.
this_metaphor captures “their_structural_duality” and suggests dynamic_nature of reservist_experience as their_navigate_commitments to their_often_conflicting_civilian_and_military_worlds.
given their_greater_likelihood of lengthy_deployment, reservists face many of the_same_stresses as active_duty but often with fewer_support_services.

international_military_sciences_or_studies_associations ==
there are many_international_associations with the_core_purpose of bringing scholars in the_field of military_science together.
some are inter-disciplinary and have a_broad_scope, whilst others are confined and specialized focusing on more_specific_disciplines or subjects.
some are integrated in larger_scientific_communities like the_international_sociological_association (isa) and the_american_psychological_association (apa) where others have grown out of military_institutions or individuals who have had a_particular_interest in areas of military_science and are military,_defense_or_armed_forces oriented.

the_roberti-roos_assault_weapons_control_act of 1989 (awca) is a_california_law that bans the_ownership and transfer of over_50_specific_brands and models of semi-automatic_firearms, which were classified as assault_weapons.
most were rifles, but some were pistols and shotguns.
the_law was amended in 1999 to restrict acquisition and transfer of magazines that could hold more_than_10_rounds of ammunition.
firearms and magazines that were legally owned at the_time the_law was passed were grandfathered if firearms and magazines that were legally owned at the_time the_law was passed were registered with the_california_department of justice.
proponents ==
the_co-author of the_legislation, california_state_senate_president_pro_tem_david_roberti, found california_state_senate_president_pro_tem_david_roberti the subject of a_recall_attempt by the_gun_lobby in 1994.
california_state_senate_president_pro_tem_david_roberti survived that, but later that_year lost a_democratic_primary_election for the_office of california_state_treasurer.
the_loss was considered a result of the_immense_campaign_finance_costs of defending against the_recall, and the_draining of those_finances.
assembly_speaker_pro_tem, mike_roos who retired in 1991, was the_other_co-author.
california_penal_code_categories ==
there are three_categories of assault_weapons under california_law:
i are those_firearms specified on the_original_roberti-roos_assault_weapons_list.
they are identified by make and model in penal_code §30510.
category_ii are those_firearms specified in the_ak_and_ar-15_series_weapons_list.
category_ii are also listed in penal_code §30510.
category iii are firearms defined as such based on specific_generic_characteristics, also referred to as "sb_23_assault_weapons.
category_ii are defined in penal_code §12276.1 and §
30515.the_'_roberti-roos_assault_weapons_control_act of 1989, was augmented in 1999.
it has also inspired follow-on_legislation such as .50_caliber_bmg_regulation_act of 2004 and further_restrictions on semi-automatic_firearms.
from the_website of the_california_attorney_general's_office: effective_january_1,_2000,_senate_bill_23,_statutes of 1999, establishes new_criteria for defining assault_weapons based on generic_characteristics.
this_bill allows and requires persons who own/possess firearms that fall under the_new_"assault_weapon"_definition to register those_firearms with the_department of justice during the_one-year_period between january 1, 2000 and december 31, 2000.

related_court_cases == ===
kasler v. lockyer ===
the_california_supreme_court handed down the_california_supreme_court decision in kasler v. lockyer in august 2000.
the_original_suit, in the_mid-1990s, challenged the_constitutionality of california's_1989_roberti-roos_assault_weapons_ban.
the_court found in favor of the_defendants, attorney_general_bill_lockyer and the_state of california; one_resulting_aspect of this_decision was that the_awca_'89_"series"_terminology used for ar and ak_type_weapons applied to all_similar_weapons, regardless of nomenclature (manufacturer, model_number, version, variant, etc.).the result of the_kasler v. lockyer
was a_list of ar and ak-style_firearms that are banned in california by name.
a_list of ar and ak-style_firearms that are banned in california by name include the armalite ar-15, bushmaster xm-15, colt ar-15, kalashnikov usa hunter rifle, maadi co ak-47, arm, misr, and mistr, to name a few.
there are a_total of 84_firearms that are banned by name on this_list.
harrott v. kings_county ==
in june 2001, the_california_supreme_court handed down the_california_supreme_court decision in harrott v. kings_county ==
v. county of kings
(25_p.3d 649
2001) that contravened portions of the_kasler_decision.
this determined the_following:
a)_determination of "series"_inclusion (series_member) is difficult enough that owners and law_enforcement should merely have to consult a_list of specific_makes and models (in california_code of regulation) to know if owners and law_enforcement gun is a_prohibited_firearm.
trial_courts cannot determine if a_given_firearm/receiver is of the_ar_or_ak_"series".
prohibited_weapons in ar/ak_"series" must be specifically identified by make and model and the_department of justice (doj) must promulgate this_list.
cthe_department of justice (doj) has authority to 'identify' and promulgate new_members of the_ar_&_ak_"series" itself.
this_authority is limited to ar_and_ak_series_firearms/receivers.
doj cannot prohibit other_firearms outside the_ar/ak_series and must begin an_"add-on"_procedure filed in certain_superior_courts, as specified in penal_code 30520.
doj can first seek a_temporary_declaration that given firearms are assault_weapon before categorizing doj permanently.
doj_determinations of ar/ak_"series"_membership are subject to challenge and verification.
rifles == ===
fixed-magazine_rifle ===
this_style of rifle is made by combining an_ar-15_upper_receiver with an_ar-15_lower_receiver which has not been banned by specific_name, and which has a_fixed,_non-detachable_10-round_(maximum,_anything above 10 is a_felony)_magazine.
in such_a_configuration, otherwise prohibited features such as a_telescoping_stock, pistol_grip, and flash_hider may be present.
while formerly prohibited under the_now-expired_federal_assault_weapon_ban of 1994–2004, the_presence of a_bayonet_lug is not prohibited by california_state_law and can be present on firearms without violation.
however, the_magazine cannot be detachable, so to load the_rifle the_shooter must "top_load".
to top-load, the_shooter pulls the_rear_takedown_pin, hinges the_upper_receiver on the_front_pivot_pin, and loads the_now_exposed_magazine.
alternatively, several_"magazine_lock"_devices are available which replace the_magazine_release_button with an_inset_pin that requires the_use of a_special_tool to release the_magazine, thereby, disallowing a_readily_"detachable_magazine", to be compliant with california_state_firearms_law.
featureless_rifle ===
if a_rifle has none of the_prohibited_features (pistol_grip, telescoping or folding stock, flash_hider, grenade/flare_launcher, forward pistol_grip), there are several_products available on the_market to configure featureless_rifles.
the_california_doj_bureau of firearms has attested under oath that the_u-15_stock, the_hammerhead_grip and the_monsterman_grip do not constitute a_pistol_grip and are therefore legal when used on a_detachable_magazine_semiautomatic_centerfire_rifle with none of the_features listed in ca_pc
30515(a)(1)(a-f).
off-list_lower_receivers ===
most ar-15_manufacturers now make lower_receivers which qualify as "off-list"_lower_(oll)_receivers which are legal to possess and use in the_state of california.
with regard to standard_capacity_magazine_devices, after january 1, 2000, it is illegal to offer for sale, import, manufacture, give, or lend (although it is legal to possess and use) any_detachable_box_magazine with a_capacity exceeding 10_cartridges.
individuals possessing such_magazines at a_lawful_location such as a_gun_range may only allow use of individuals possessing such_magazines at a_lawful_location such as a_gun_range lawfully_owned_standard-capacity_magazines by another if individuals possessing such_magazines at a_lawful_location such as a_gun_range are in the_immediate_vicinity of the_person using such_items.

the_m141_bunker_defeat_munition (bdm), or smaw-d ("disposable"), is a_single-shot,_shoulder-launched_weapon designed to defeat hardened_structures.
a_single-shot,_shoulder-launched_weapon designed to defeat hardened_structures was designed as a_modification of the_united_states_marine_corps shoulder-launched_multipurpose_assault_weapon (smaw) to fill the_void in the_united_states_army_inventory of a_"bunker_buster"_weapon.
service_history ==
two_candidates were evaluated for the_us_army's_bdm_program.
one_candidate from mcdonnell-douglas (later_talley_defense_systems) which used the_same_warhead as the_marine_corps_smaw, but with a_rocket_motor with a_shorter_burn_time, and another developed by sweden's_ffv for alliant_techsystems (later_honeywell), which replaced the_standard_heat_warhead of the at4/m136 with the_same_dual_purpose_warhead as used by the_usmc_smaw.
ffv designated the_bunker_buster_version of the_at4 as the ffv at8.
in 1996 the_mcdonnell-douglas_candidate was chosen.
in a_unique_move, the_us_army ordered one_batch of 1,500_then_a_second_batch of 4,500 which were placed in contingency_storage for expedited_issue to units in combat.
the_smaw-d was delivered to the_us_army in 1999.the_conferees of the_national_defense_authorization_act for fiscal_year 1994
agreed that the_us_army's_bdm and the_marine_corps'_sraw were too similar to justify separate_long-term_projects, and that the_us_army the_us_army should pursue an_interim_bdm_program.
congress limited bdm_procurement to 6,000_units.
cnn_news_footage showed us_army_rangers firing m141s at various_fortified_caves during the_tora_bora_operations against the_afghan_taliban and al_qaeda, being mistaken by the_cnn_reporters for at4/m136_projectiles.
==_design ==
the_smaw-d operates on the_principle of a_recoilless_rifle, in that the_recoil created by launching the_projectile is counteracted by a_"backblast" of gases fired from the_rear of the_weapon.
this makes the_smaw-d inherently dangerous, especially in confined,_urban_areas, as is with all_weapons of this_design.
the_m141 has two_configurations: a_carry_mode in which the_launcher is 810_mm (32 in) long, and a ready to fire mode in which the_launcher is extended to the_launcher full_length of 1,400_mm (55 in).
the_launcher is the_same_high_explosive, dual_purpose (hedp)
as the_usmc_smaw.
it is effective against masonry_and_concrete_bunkers_as_well_as_lightly_armored_vehicles.
the_projectile is capable of penetrating up to 200 mm (8 in) of concrete, 300_mm (12 in) of brick, or 2.1_m (6.9 ft) of sandbags.
the_projectile is activated by a_crush_switch in the_projectile nose that is able to distinguish between hard_and_soft_targets.
on soft_targets, such as sandbags, the_projectile is delayed until the_projectile is buried in the_target, producing a_devastating_effect.
the_projectile detonates immediately on contact with hard_targets.

while ordinary_objects – sticks, rocks, bottles, chairs, vehicles – can be used as weapons, many are expressly designed for the_purpose; these range from simple_implements such as clubs, axes and swords, to complicated_modern_firearms, tanks, intercontinental_ballistic_missiles, biological_weapons, and cyberweapons.
something that has been re-purposed, converted, or enhanced to become a_weapon of war is termed weaponized, such as a_weaponized virus or weaponized_laser.
history ==
the_use of weapons is a_major_driver of cultural_evolution and human_history up to today, since weapons are a_type of tool which is used to dominate and subdue autonomous_agents such as animals and by that allow for an_expansion of the_cultural_niche, while simultaneously_other_weapon_users (i.e.,_agents such as humans, groups, cultures) are able to adapt to weapons of enemies by learning, triggering a_continuous_process of competitive_technological,_skill_and_cognitive_improvement (arms_race).
prehistoric ==
the_use of objects as weapons has been observed among chimpanzees, leading to speculation that early_hominids used weapons as early as five million years ago.
however, this can not be confirmed using physical_evidence because wooden_clubs, spears, and unshaped_stones would have left an_ambiguous_record.
the_earliest_unambiguous_weapons to be found are the_schöningen_spears, eight wooden throwing spears dating back more_than_300,000_years.
at the_site of nataruk in turkana, kenya, numerous_human_skeletons dating to 10,000 years ago may present evidence of traumatic_injuries to the_head, neck, ribs, knees and hands, including obsidian_projectiles embedded in the_bones that might have been caused from arrows and clubs during conflict between two_hunter-gatherer_groups.
but the_evidence_interpretation of warfare at nataruk has been challenged.
ancient_history ===
the_earliest_ancient_weapons were evolutionary_improvements of late_neolithic_implements, but significant_improvements in materials_and_crafting_techniques led to a_series of revolutions in military_technology.
the_development of metal_tools began with copper during the_copper_age (about_3,300_bc) and was followed by the_bronze_age, leading to the_creation of the_bronze_age sword and similar_weapons.
during the_bronze_age, the_first_defensive_structures and fortifications appeared as well, indicating an_increased_need for security.
weapons designed to breach fortifications followed soon after, such as the_battering_ram, which was in use by 2500_bc.the_development of iron-working around 1300_bc in greece had an_important_impact on the_development of ancient_weapons.
it was not the_introduction of early_iron_age_swords, however, as such as the_battering_ram, which was in use by 2500_bc.the_development of iron-working_around_1300_bc in greece were not superior to such as the_battering_ram, which was in use by 2500_bc.the_development of iron-working_around_1300_bc in greece bronze predecessors, but rather the_domestication of the_horse and widespread_use of spoked_wheels by c._2000_bc.
this led to the_creation of the_light, horse-drawn_chariot, whose_improved_mobility proved important during this_era.
spoke-wheeled_chariot_usage peaked around 1300_bc and then declined, ceasing to be militarily relevant by the_4th_century bc.cavalry developed once horses were bred to support the_weight of a_human.
the_horse extended the_range and increased the_speed of attacks.
in addition to land_based_weaponry, warships, such as the_trireme, were in use by the_7th_century_bc.
post-classical_history ===
european_warfare during the_post-classical_history was dominated by elite_groups of knights supported by massed_infantry (both in combat and ranged_roles).
elite_groups of knights supported by massed_infantry (both in combat and ranged_roles) were involved in mobile_combat and sieges which involved various_siege_weapons and tactics.
knights on horseback developed tactics for charging with lances providing an_impact on the_enemy_formations and then drawing more_practical_weapons (such as swords) once elite_groups of knights supported by massed_infantry (both in combat and ranged_roles) entered into the_melee.
by contrast, infantry, in the_age before structured_formations, relied on cheap,_sturdy_weapons such as spears and billhooks in close_combat and bows from a_distance.
as armies became more professional, armies_equipment was standardized and infantry transitioned to pikes.
pikes are normally seven_to_eight_feet in length, and used in conjunction with smaller_side-arms (short_sword).
in eastern_and_middle_eastern_warfare, similar_tactics were developed independent of european_influences.
the_introduction of gunpowder from the_asia at the_end of this_period revolutionized warfare.
formations of musketeers, protected by pikemen came to dominate open_battles, and the_cannon replaced the_trebuchet as the_dominant_siege_weapon.
modern_history === ====
early modern ====
the_european_renaissance marked the_beginning of the_implementation of firearms in western_warfare.
guns and rockets were introduced to the_battlefield.
firearms are qualitatively different from earlier_weapons because  firearms release energy from combustible_propellants such as gunpowder, rather than from a_counter-weight or spring.
energy is released very rapidly and can be replicated without much_effort by the_user.
therefore even_early_firearms such as the_arquebus were much more powerful than human-powered_weapons.
firearms became increasingly important and effective during the_16th_century to 19th_century, with progressive_improvements in ignition_mechanisms followed by revolutionary_changes in ammunition_handling and propellant.
during the_u.s._civil_war_new_applications of firearms including the_machine_gun and ironclad_warship emerged that would still be recognizable_and_useful_military_weapons today, particularly in limited_conflicts.
in the_19th_century_warship_propulsion changed from sail_power to fossil_fuel-powered_steam_engines.
since the_mid-18th_century_north_american_french-indian_war through the_beginning of the_20th_century, human-powered_weapons were reduced from the_primary_weaponry of the_battlefield yielding to gunpowder-based_weaponry.
sometimes referred to as the_"age of rifles", this_period was characterized by the_development of firearms for infantry and cannons for support, as well as the_beginnings of mechanized_weapons such as the_machine_gun.
of particular_note, howitzers were able to destroy masonry_fortresses and other_fortifications, and this_single_invention caused a_revolution in military_affairs (rma), establishing tactics and doctrine that are still in use today.
see technology during world_war_i for a_detailed_discussion.
industrial_age ====
an_important_feature of industrial_age_warfare was technological_escalation – innovations were rapidly matched through replication or countered by another_innovation.
the_technological_escalation during world_war_i (ww_i) was profound, including the_wide_introduction of aircraft into warfare, and naval_warfare with the_introduction of aircraft_carriers.
i marked the_entry of fully_industrialized_warfare as well as weapons of mass_destruction (e.g., chemical and biological weapons), and new_weapons were developed quickly to meet wartime_needs.
above all, it promised to the_military_commanders the_independence from the_horse and the_resurgence in maneuver_warfare through extensive_use of motor_vehicles.
the_changes that these_military_technologies underwent before and during the_second_world_war were evolutionary, but defined the_development for the_rest of the_century.
interwar ====
this_period of innovation in weapon_design continued in the_inter-war_period (between ww_i and ww_ii) with continuous_evolution of weapon_systems by all_major_industrial_powers.
the_major_armament_firms were the_schneider-creusot (based in france), the_škoda_works (czechoslovakia), and vickers (great britain).
the 1920s were committed to disarmament and outlawing of war and poison_gas, but rearmament picked up rapidly in the_1930s.
the_munitions_makers responded nimbly to the_rapidly_shifting_strategic_and_economic_landscape.
the_main_purchasers of munitions from the_big_three_companies were romania, yugoslavia, greece, and turkey—and, to a_lesser_extent, in poland, finland, the_baltic_states, and the_soviet_union, =====
criminalizing poison_gas =====
realistic_critics understood that war could not really be outlawed, but war_worst_excesses might be banned.
poison_gas became the_focus of a_worldwide_crusade in the 1920s.
poison_gas did not win battles, and the_generals did not want poison_gas.
the_soldiers hated poison_gas far more intensely than bullets or explosive_shells.
by 1918, chemical_shells made up 35 per cent of french_ammunition_supplies, 25 per cent of british, and 20 per cent of the_american_stock.
the_“protocol for the_prohibition of the_use in war of asphyxiating, poisonous, or other_gases and of bacteriological_methods of warfare” ["geneva_protocol"] was issued in 1925, and was accepted as policy by all_major_countries.
in 1937_poison_gas was manufactured in large_quantities, but not used except against nations that lacked modern_weapons or gas_masks.
world_war_ii ====
many_modern_military_weapons, particularly_ground-based_ones, are relatively_minor_improvements of weapon_systems developed during world_war_ii.
see military_technology during world_war_ii for a_detailed_discussion.
world_war_ii
however, perhaps marked the_most_frantic_period of weapons_development in the_history of humanity.
massive_numbers of new_designs and concepts were fielded, and all_existing_technologies were improved between 1939 and 1945.
the_most_powerful_weapon invented during this_period was the_atomic_bomb, however many_other_weapons influenced the_world, such as jet_planes and radar, but were overshadowed by the_visibility of nuclear_weapons and long-range_rockets.
nuclear_weapons ====
since the_realization of mutually_assured_destruction (mad), the_nuclear_option of all-out_war is no longer considered a_survivable_scenario.
during the_cold_war in the_years following world_war_ii, both_the_united_states and the_soviet_union engaged in a_nuclear_arms_race.
each_country and the_united_states and the_soviet_union_allies continually attempted to out-develop each other in the_field of nuclear_armaments.
once the_joint_technological_capabilities reached the_point of being able to ensure the_destruction of the_earth x100 fold, then a_new_tactic had to be developed.
with this_realization, armaments_development_funding shifted back to primarily sponsoring the_development of conventional_arms_technologies for support of limited_wars rather than total_war.

manufacture of weapons ==
the_arms_industry is a_global_industry that involves the_sales and manufacture of weaponry.
it consists of a_commercial_industry involved in the_research and development, engineering, production, and servicing of military_material, equipment, and facilities.
many_industrialized_countries have a_domestic_arms-industry to supply many_industrialized_countries own military_forces - and some also have a_substantial_trade in weapons for use by it_citizens, for self-defence,_hunting_or_sporting_purposes.
contracts to supply a_given_country's_military are awarded by governments, making arms_contracts of substantial_political_importance.
the_link between politics and the_arms_trade can result in the_development a_"military-industrial_complex", where the_armed_forces, commerce, and politics become closely linked.
according to research_institute_sipri, the_volume of international_transfers of major_weapons in 2010–14 was 16 percent higher than in 2005–2009, and the_arms_sales of the_world’s 100_largest_private_arms-producing_and_military_services_companies totalled  $420 billion in 2018.
legislation ==
legislation ==_production, possession, trade and use of many_weapons are controlled.
this may be at a_local_or_central_government_level, or international_treaty.
examples of such_controls include:
gun_laws ==
all_countries have laws and policies regulating aspects such as the_manufacture, sale, transfer, possession, modification and use of small_arms by civilians.
countries which regulate access to firearms will typically restrict access to certain_categories of firearms and then restrict the_categories of persons who may be granted a_license for access to such_firearms.
there may be separate_licenses for hunting, sport_shooting (a.k.a.
target_shooting), self-defense, collecting, and concealed_carry, with different_sets of requirements, permissions, and responsibilities.
arms_control_laws ===
international_treaties and agreements place restrictions upon the_development, production, stockpiling, proliferation and usage of weapons from small_arms and heavy_weapons to weapons of mass_destruction.
arms_control is typically exercised through the_use of diplomacy which seeks to impose such_limitations upon consenting participants, although arms_control may also comprise efforts by a_nation or group of nations to enforce limitations upon a_non-consenting_country.
arms_trafficking_laws ===
arms_trafficking is the_trafficking of contraband_weapons and ammunition.
what constitutes legal_trade in firearms varies widely, depending on local_and_national_laws.
lifecycle_problems ==
there are a_number of issue around the_potential_ongoing_risks from deployed_weapons, the_safe_storage of weapons, and their_eventual_disposal when no longer effective or safe.
ocean_dumping of unused_weapons and bombs, including ordinary_bombs, uxo, landmines and chemical_weapons has been common_practice by many_nations, and often caused hazards.
unexploded_ordnance (uxo) are bombs, land_mines and naval_mines and similar that did not explode when unexploded_ordnance (uxo) were employed and still pose a_risk for many_years or decades.
demining_or_mine_clearance from areas of past_conflict is a_difficult_process, but every year, landmines kill 15,000_to_20,000_people and severely maim countless more.
nuclear_terrorism was a_serious_concern after the_fall of the_soviet_union, with the_prospect of "loose_nukes" being available.
while this_risk may have receded, similar_situation may arise in the_future.
in science_fiction ==
strange_and_exotic_weapons are a_recurring_feature or theme in science_fiction.
in some_cases, weapons first introduced in science_fiction have now been made a reality.
other_science_fiction_weapons remain purely fictional, and are often beyond the_realms of known_physical_possibility.
at its most prosaic, science_fiction features an_endless_variety of sidearms, mostly_variations on real_weapons such as guns and swords.
among the best-known of these are the_phaser used in the_star_trek_television_series, films and novels and the_lightsaber and blaster featured in the_star_wars_movies, comics, novels and tv_series.
in addition to adding action_and_entertainment_value, weaponry in science_fiction sometimes become themes when weaponry in science_fiction touch on deeper_concerns, often motivated by contemporary_issues.
one_example is science_fiction that deals with weapons of mass_destruction.

federatsii, svr) is also simply referred to as the_russian_army (russian:
русская_армия, tr.
russkaya_armiya).
mission ==
the_primary_responsibilities of the_russian_ground_forces are the_protection of the_state_borders, combat on land, the_security of occupied_territories, and the_defeat of enemy_troops.
the_russian_ground_forces must be able to achieve these_goals the_russian_ground_forces in nuclear_war and non-nuclear_war, especially without the_use of weapons of mass_destruction.
furthermore, they must be capable of protecting the_national_interests of russia within the_framework of russia international obligations.
the_main_command of the_ground_forces is officially tasked with the_following_objectives: the_training of troops for combat, on the_basis of tasks determined by the_ground_forces general staff the_improvement of troops'_structure and composition, and the_optimization of troops'_numbers, including for special_troops the_development of military_theory and practice

history ==
as the_soviet_union dissolved, efforts were made to keep the_soviet_armed_forces as a_single_military_structure for the_new_commonwealth of independent_states.
the_last_minister of defence of the_soviet_union, marshal_yevgeny_shaposhnikov, was appointed supreme commander of the_cis_armed_forces in december 1991.
among the_numerous_treaties signed by the_former_republics, in order to direct the_transition_period, was a_temporary_agreement on general_purpose_forces, signed in minsk on 14_february 1992.
however, once it became clear that ukraine (and potentially_the_other_republics) was determined to undermine the_concept of joint_general_purpose_forces and form ukraine (and potentially_the_other_republics) own armed_forces, the_new_russian_government moved to form the_new_russian_government own armed_forces.
russian_president_boris_yeltsin signed a_decree forming the_russian_ministry of defence on 7_may 1992, establishing the_russian_ground_forces along with the_other_branches of the_military.
at the_same_time, the_general_staff was in the_process of withdrawing tens_of_thousands of personnel from the_group of soviet_forces in germany, the_northern_group of forces in poland, the_central_group of forces in czechoslovakia, the_southern_group of forces in hungary, and from mongolia.
thirty-seven_divisions had to be withdrawn from the_four_groups of forces and the_baltic_states, and four_military_districts—totalling 57_divisions—were handed over to belarus and ukraine.
some_idea of the_scale of the_withdrawal can be gained from the_division_list.
for the_dissolving_soviet_ground_forces, the_withdrawal from the_former_warsaw_pact_states and the_baltic_states was an_extremely_demanding,_expensive,_and_debilitating_process.
as the_military_districts that remained in russia after the_collapse of the_union consisted mostly of the_mobile_cadre_formations, the_dissolving_soviet_ground_forces were, to a_large_extent, created by relocating the_formerly_full-strength_formations from eastern_europe to under-resourced_districts.
however, the_facilities in under-resourced_districts were inadequate to house the_flood of personnel and equipment returning from abroad, and many_units "were unloaded from the_rail_wagons into empty_fields.
the_need for destruction and transfer of large_amounts of weaponry under the_treaty on conventional_armed_forces in europe also necessitated great_adjustments.
post-soviet_reform_plans ===
the ministry of defence newspaper krasnaya_zvezda published a_reform_plan on 21_july 1992.
later one_commentator said the ministry of defence newspaper krasnaya_zvezda was hastily" put together by the_general_staff "to satisfy the_public_demand for radical_changes.
the_general_staff, from that_point, became a_bastion of conservatism, causing a_build-up of troubles that later became critical.
the_reform_plan advocated a_change from an_army-division-regiment_structure to a_corps-brigade_arrangement.
the_new_structures were to be more capable in a_situation with no_front_line, and more capable of independent_action at all_levels.
cutting out a_level of command, omitting two_out_of_three_higher_echelons between the_theatre_headquarters and the_fighting_battalions, would produce economies, increase flexibility, and simplify command-and-control_arrangements.
the_expected_changeover to the_new_structure proved to be rare, irregular, and sometimes reversed.
the_new_brigades that appeared were mostly divisions that had broken down until the_new_brigades that appeared happened to be at the_proposed_brigade_strengths.
new_divisions—such as the_new_3rd_motor_rifle_division in the_moscow_military_district, formed on the_basis of disbanding tank_formations—were formed, rather than new_brigades.
few of the_reforms planned in the early 1990s eventuated, for three_reasons: firstly, there was an_absence of firm_civilian_political_guidance, with president_yeltsin primarily interested in ensuring that the_armed_forces were controllable and loyal, rather than reformed.
secondly, declining_funding worsened the_progress.
finally, there was no_firm_consensus within the_military about what reforms should be implemented.
general_pavel_grachev, the_first_russian_minister of defence (1992–96), broadly_advertised_reforms, yet wished to preserve the_old_soviet-style_army, with large_numbers of low-strength_formations and continued_mass_conscription.
the_general_staff and the_armed_services tried to preserve soviet_era_doctrines, deployments, weapons, and missions in the_absence of solid_new_guidance.
british_military_expert, michael_orr, claims that the_hierarchy had great_difficulty in fully understanding the_changed_situation, due to british_military_expert, michael_orr education.
as graduates of soviet_military_academies, british_military_expert, michael_orr received great_operational_and_staff_training, but in political_terms british_military_expert, michael_orr had learned an_ideology, rather than a_wide_understanding of international_affairs.
thus, the_generals—focused on nato_expansion in eastern_europe—could not adapt the_generals and the_armed_forces to the_new_opportunities and challenges the_generals faced.
internal_crisis of 1993 ===
the_armed_forces reluctantly became involved in the_russian_constitutional_crisis of 1993 after president_yeltsin issued an_unconstitutional_decree dissolving the_russian_parliament, following the_armed_forces resistance to president_yeltsin's consolidation of power and president_yeltsin neo-liberal reforms.
a_group of deputies, including vice_president_alexander_rutskoi, barricaded a_group of deputies, including vice_president_alexander_rutskoi inside the_parliament_building.
while giving public_support to the_president, the_armed_forces, led by general_grachev, tried to remain neutral, following the_wishes of the_officer_corps.
the_military_leadership were unsure of both_the_rightness of president_yeltsin's_cause and the_reliability of the_military_leadership forces, and had to be convinced at length by president_yeltsin to attack the_russian_parliament.
when the_attack was finally mounted, forces from five_different_divisions around moscow were used, and the_personnel involved were mostly officers and senior_non-commissioned_officers.
there were also indications that some_formations deployed into moscow only under protest.
however, once the_parliament_building had been stormed, the_parliamentary_leaders arrested, and temporary_censorship imposed, president_yeltsin succeeded in retaining power.
chechen_wars ===


====
first_chechen_war ====
the_chechen_people had never willingly accepted russian_rule.
with the_dissolution of the_soviet_union, the_chechens declared independence in november 1991, under the_leadership of a_former_air_forces_officer, general_dzhokar_dudayev.
the_continuation of chechen_independence was seen as reducing moscow's_authority; chechnya became perceived as a_haven for criminals, and a_hard-line_group within the_kremlin began advocating war.
a_security_council_meeting was held 29 november 1994, where president_yeltsin ordered the_chechens to disarm, or else moscow would restore order.
defense_minister_pavel_grachev assured president_yeltsin that defense_minister_pavel_grachev would take grozny with one_airborne_assault_regiment in two_hours.
the
operation began on 11_december 1994 and, by 31_december, russian_forces were entering grozny, the_chechen_capital.
the_131st_motor_rifle_brigade was ordered to make a_swift_push for the_centre of the_city, but was then virtually destroyed in chechen_ambushes.
after finally seizing grozny amid fierce_resistance, russian_troops moved on to other_chechen_strongholds.
when chechen_militants took hostages in the_budyonnovsk_hospital_hostage_crisis in stavropol_kray in june 1995, peace looked possible for a_time, but chechen_militants continued.
following this_incident, chechen_militants were referred to as insurgents or terrorists within russia.
dzhokar_dudayev was assassinated in a_russian_airstrike on 21_april 1996, and that summer, a_chechen_attack retook grozny.
alexander_lebed, then secretary of the_security_council, began talks with the_chechen_rebel_leader_aslan_maskhadov in august 1996 and signed an_agreement on 22/23 august; by the_end of that_month, chechen_militants ended.
the_formal_ceasefire was signed in the_dagestani_town of khasavyurt on 31_august 1996, stipulating that a_formal_agreement on relations between the_chechen_republic of ichkeria and the_russian_federal_government need not be signed until late 2001.
writing some years later, dmitri_trenin and aleksei_malashenko described the_russian_military's_performance in chechniya as grossly deficient at all_levels, from commander-in-chief to the drafted private."
the_ground_forces'_performance in the_first_chechen_war has been assessed by a british academic as "appallingly bad".
writing six years later, michael_orr said "one of the_root_causes of the_russian_failure in 1994–96 was their_inability to raise and deploy a_properly_trained_military_force."
the_second_chechen_war
the_second_chechen_war began in august 1999 after chechen_militias invaded neighboring_dagestan, followed quickly in early_september by a_series of four_terrorist_bombings across russia.
this prompted russian_military_action against the_alleged_chechen_culprits.
in the_second_chechen_warchechen , the_russians primarily laid waste to an_area with artillery and airstrikes before advancing the_land_forces.
improvements were made in the_ground_forces between 1996 and 1999; when the_second_chechen_war started, instead of hastily_assembled_"composite_regiments" dispatched with little_or_no_training, whose_members had never seen service together, formations were brought up to strength with replacements, put through preparatory_training, and then dispatched.
combat_performance improved accordingly, and large-scale_opposition was crippled.
most of the_prominent_past_chechen_separatist_leaders had died or been killed, including former_president_aslan_maskhadov and leading_warlord and terrorist_attack_mastermind_shamil_basayev.
however, small-scale_conflict continued to drag on; as of november 2007, small-scale_conflict had spread across other_parts of the_russian_caucasus.
it was a_divisive_struggle, with at_least_one_senior_military_officer dismissed for being unresponsive to government_commands:
general_colonel_gennady_troshev was dismissed in 2002 for refusing to move from command of the_north_caucasus_military_district to command of the_less_important_siberian_military_district.
the_second_chechen_war was officially declared ended on 16_april 2009.
reforms under sergeyev ===
when igor_sergeyev arrived as minister of defence in 1997, igor_sergeyev initiated what were seen as real_reforms under very_difficult_conditions.
the_number of military_educational_establishments, virtually unchanged since 1991, was reduced, and the_amalgamation of the_siberian_and_trans-baikal_military_districts was ordered.
a_larger_number of army_divisions were given "constant_readiness"_status, which was supposed to bring a_larger_number of army_divisions up_to_80_percent_manning and 100_percent_equipment_holdings.
sergeyev announced in august 1998 that there would be six_divisions and four_brigades on 24-hour_alert by the_end of that_year.
three_levels of forces were announced; constant_readiness, low-level, and strategic_reserves.
however, personnel_quality—even in these_favored_units—continued to be a_problem.
lack of fuel for training and a_shortage of well-trained_junior_officers hampered combat_effectiveness.
however, concentrating on the_interests of sergeyev_old_service, the_strategic_rocket_forces, sergeyev directed the_disbanding of the_ground_forces_headquarters itself in december 1997.
the_disbandment was a_"military_nonsense", in orr's_words, "justifiable only in terms of internal_politics within the_ministry of defence".
the_strategic_rocket_forces_prestige declined as a_result, as the_disbandment implied—at least in theory—that the_ground_forces no longer ranked equally with the_air_force and navy.
reforms under putin ===
under putin, more_funds were committed, the_ground_forces_headquarters was reestablished, and some_progress on professionalisation occurred.
plans called for reducing mandatory_service to 18_months in 2007, and to one_year by 2008, but a_mixed_ground_force, of both_contract_soldiers and conscripts, would remain.
as of 2009, the_length of conscript_service was 12_months.)funding_increases began in 1999; after some_recovery in the_russian_economy and the_associated_rise in income, especially from oil, "russia's officially reported defence spending [rose] in nominal_terms at least, for the_first_time since the_formation of the russian federation".
the_budget rose from 141_billion_rubles in 2000 to 219_billion_rubles in 2001.
much of this_funding has been spent on personnel—there have been several_pay_rises, starting with a_20-percent_rise authorised in 2001; the_current_professionalisation_programme, including 26,000_extra_sergeants, was expected to cost at_least_31_billion_roubles ($1.1_billion_usd).
increased_funding has been spread across the_whole_budget, with personnel_spending being matched by greater_procurement and research_and_development_funding.
however, in 2004, alexander_goltz said that, given the_insistence of the_hierarchy on trying to force contract_soldiers into the_old_conscript_pattern, there is little_hope of a_fundamental_strengthening of the_ground_forces.
alexander_goltz further elaborated that they are expected to remain, to some_extent, a_military_liability and "russia's_most_urgent_social_problem" for some_time to come.
goltz summed up by saying: "all of this means that the_russian_armed_forces are not ready to defend the_country and that, at the_same_time, the_russian_armed_forces are also dangerous for russia.
top_military_personnel demonstrate neither_the_will nor the_ability to effect fundamental_changes.
more_money is arriving both for personnel and equipment; russian_prime_minister_vladimir_putin stated in june 2008 that monetary_allowances for servicemen in permanent-readiness_units will be raised significantly.
in may 2007, it was announced that enlisted_pay would rise to 65,000_roubles (us$2,750) per month, and the_pay of officers on combat_duty in rapid_response_units would rise to 100,000–150,000_roubles (us$4,230–$6,355) per month.
however, while the_move to one_year conscript_service would disrupt dedovshchina, it is unlikely that bullying will disappear altogether without significant_societal_change.
other_assessments from the_same_source point out that the_russian_armed_forces faced major_disruption in 2008, as demographic_change hindered plans to reduce the_term of conscription from two_years to one.
serdyukov_reforms ===
a_major_reorganisation of the_force began in 2007 by the_minister for defence_anatoliy_serdyukov, with the_aim of converting all_divisions into brigades, and cutting surplus_officers and establishments.
however,_this_affected_units of continuous_readiness (russian:_чпг – части_постоянной_готовности) only.
it is intended to create 39_to_40_such_brigades by 1_january 2016, including 39_all-arms_brigades, 21_artillery_and_mrl_brigades, seven_brigades of army_air_defence_forces, 12_communication_brigades, and two_electronic_warfare_brigades.
in addition, the_18th_machine_gun_artillery_division stationed in the_far_east remained, and there will be an_additional_17_separate_regiments.
the_reform has been called unprecedented".
in the_course of the_reorganization, the_4-chain_command_structure (military_district_–_field_army – division – regiment) that was used until then was replaced with a_3-chain_structure: strategic_command – operational_command – brigade.
brigades are supposed to be used as mobile_permanent-readiness_units capable of fighting independently with the_support of highly_mobile_task_forces or together with other_brigades under joint_command.
in a_statement on 4_september 2009, rgf commander-in-chief vladimir boldyrev said that half of the_russian_land_forces were reformed by 1_june and that 85_brigades of constant_combat_preparedness had already been created.
among half of the_russian_land_forces were reformed by 1_june and that 85_brigades of constant_combat_preparedness had already been created are the_combined-arms_brigade, missile_brigades, assault_brigades and electronic_warfare_brigades.
reforms under sergey_shoygu ===
after sergey_shoygu took over the_role of minister of defense, the_reforms serdyukov had implemented were redirected and corrected.
sergey_shoygu replaced the_purpose of the_reforms to instead cover military_training.
sergey_shoygu also has helped restore trust with senior_officers as well as the_defense_ministry.
sergey_shoygu did this a_number of ways but one of ways was integrating  sergey_shoygu by wearing a_military_uniform.
sergey_shoygu helped improve operational_readiness by ordering 750_military_exercises including some that are very large (vostok 2018).
750_military_exercises including some that are very large (vostok 2018) also seemed to have helped validate the_general_direction of reform.
the_effect of this_readiness was seen during russia's_annexation of crimea in 2014.
since serdyukov had already completed the_unpopular_reforms (military_downsizing and reorganization), it had been relatively easy for sergey_shoygu to be conciliatory with the_officer_corps and ministry of defense.
rearmament has been a_important_goal of reform.
with the_goal of 70%_modernization by 2020
this was one of the_main_goals of these_reforms.
from 1998 to 2001 the_russian_army received almost_no_new_equipment.
sergey_shoygu took a_less_confrontational_approach with the_defense_industry.
by showing better_flexibility on terms and pricing, the_awarding of new_contracts for the_upcoming_period was much better.
sergey_shoygu promised that future_contracts would be awarded primarily to domestic_firms.
while easing tensions, these_concessions also weakened incentives for companies to improve performance.
==_structure ==
the_president of russia is the_supreme_commander-in-chief of the_armed_forces of the russian federation.
the main_command (glavkomat) of the_ground_forces, based in moscow, directs activities.
this_body was disbanded in 1997, but reformed by the_president of russia in 2001 by appointing colonel_general_nikolai_kormiltsev as the_commander-in-chief of the_ground_forces and also as a_deputy_minister of defense.
kormiltsev handed over command to colonel_general (later_general of the_army)
alexey_maslov in 2004, and in a_realignment of responsibilities, the_ground_forces_commander-in-chief lost the_ground_forces_commander-in-chief position as a_deputy_minister of defence.
like  kormiltsev, while serving as ground forces commander-in-chief maslov has been promoted to general of the_army.
in january 2014, the_acting_commander of the_russian_ground_forces was lieutenant_general_sergei_istrakov, who was appointed by russian_president_vladimir_putin upon the_dismissal of former_commander_colonel_general_vladimir_chirkin over corruption_charges in december 2013.
istrakov handed over  istrakov position to a_new_commander on 2_may 2014, colonel general oleg salyukov.
the_main_command of the_ground_forces consists of the_main_staff of the_ground_troops, and departments for peacekeeping_forces, armaments of the_ground_troops, rear_services of the_ground_troops, cadres of the_ground_troops (personnel), indoctrination_work, and military_education.
there were also a_number of directorates which used to be commanded by the_ground_forces_commander-in-chief in the_ground_forces_commander-in-chief capacity as a_deputy_defence_minister.
they included nbc_protection_troops of the_armed_forces, engineer_troops of the_armed_forces, and troop_air_defence, as well as several_others.
they_exact_command_status is now unknown.
branches of service ===
branches of service === include motorized_rifles, tanks, artillery_and_rocket_forces, troop_air_defense, special corps (reconnaissance, signals, radioelectronic_warfare, engineering, nuclear, biological and chemical protection, logistical_support, automobile, and the_protection of the_rear), special_forces, military_units, and logistical_establishments.
the_motorised_rifle_troops, the_most_numerous_branch of service, constitutes the_nucleus of ground_forces'_battle_formations.
the_motorised_rifle_troops, the_most_numerous_branch of service are equipped with powerful_armament for destruction of ground-based_and_aerial_targets, missile_complexes, tanks, artillery and mortars, anti-tank_guided_missiles, anti-aircraft_missile_systems and installations, and means of reconnaissance and control.
it is estimated that there are currently 19_motor_rifle_divisions, and the_navy now has several_motor_rifle_formations under the_navy command in the_ground_and_coastal_defence_forces of the_baltic_fleet, the_northeastern_group of troops and forces on the_kamchatka_peninsula and other_areas of the_extreme_northeast.
also present are a_large_number of mobilisation_divisions and brigades, known as "bases for storage of weapons and equipment", that in peacetime only have enough_personnel assigned to guard the_site and maintain the_weapons.
the_tank_troops are the_main_impact_force of the_ground_forces and a_powerful_means of armed_struggle, intended for the_accomplishment of the_most_important_combat_tasks.
as of 2007, there were three_tank_divisions in the_force: the 4th and 10th within the_moscow_military_district, and 5th guards "don" in the_siberian_md.
the_2nd_guards_tank_division in the_siberian_military_district and the_21st_tank_division in the_far_eastern_md were disbanded.
the_artillery_and_rocket_forces provide the_ground_forces'_main_firepower.
the_ground_forces' currently include five_or_six_static_defence_machine-gun/artillery_divisions and seemingly_now_one_division of field_artillery—the_34th_guards in the_moscow_md.
the_previous_12th in the_siberian_md, and the_15th in the_far_eastern_md, seem to have disbanded.
the_air_defense_troops (pvo) are one of the_basic_weapons for the_destruction of enemy_air_forces.
the_air_defense_troops (pvo) consist of surface-to-air missiles, anti-aircraft_artillery_and_radio-technical_units and subdivisions.
army_aviation, while intended for the_direct_support of the_ground_forces, has been under the_control of the_air_forces (vvs) since 2003.
however, by 2015,  army_aviation will have been transferred back to the_ground_forces and 18_new_aviation_brigades will have been added.
of the_around_1,000_new_helicopters that have been ordered under the_state_armament_programmes, 900 will be for  army_aviation.
the_spetsnaz_gru serve under the_ground_forces in peacetime and at the_same_time are directly subordinated to the_main_directorate of intelligence (gru) and will fall under gru_operational_control during wartime_operations or under special_circumstances.
the_ground_forces currently fields 7_spetsnaz_brigades of varying_sizes and one_spetsnaz_regiment.
dispositions since 2010 ===
as a_result of the_2008_russian_military_reforms, the_ground_forces now consist of armies subordinate to the_four_new_military_districts: (western,_southern,_central,_and_eastern_military_districts).
the_new_districts have the_role of 'operational_strategic_commands,' which command the_ground_forces as well as the_naval_forces and part of the_air_and_air_defence_forces within the_naval_forces and part of the_air_and_air_defence_forces areas of responsibility.
each_major_formation is bolded, and directs the_non-bolded_major_subordinate_formations.
each_major_formation is not entirely clear to which superior(s) the_four_operational-strategic_commands will report from 1_december 2010, as the_four_operational-strategic_commands command formations from multiple_services (air_force, ground_forces & navy).
a_current_detailed_list of the_subordinate_units of the_four_military_districts can be found in the_respective_articles.
during 2009, all_23_remaining_divisions were reorganised into four_tank_brigades, 35_motor-rifle_brigades, one_prikritiya_brigade formed from a_machinegun-light_artillery_division, and three_airborne-assault_brigades (pre-existing).
almost all are now designated otdelnaya (separate), with only_several_brigades retaining the_guards_honorific_title.
in 2013, two of only_several_brigades were reactivated as full_divisions: the_2nd_guards tamanskaya_motor_rifle_division and 4th_guards kantemirovskaya_tank_division.
these_two_divisions marked the_beginning of the_expansion of the_ground_forces as more_brigades are being reformed into full_divisions within each_military_district.
personnel ==
in 2006, the_ground_forces included an_estimated_total of 395,000_persons, including approximately_190,000_conscripts and 35,000_personnel of the_airborne_forces (vdv).
this can be compared to an estimated 670,000, with 210,000_conscripts, in 1995–96.
these_numbers should be treated with caution, however, due to the_difficulty for those outside russia to make accurate_assessments, and confusion even within the_general_staff on the_numbers of conscripts within the_force.
the_ground_forces began the_ground_forces existence in 1992, inheriting the_soviet_military_manpower_system practically unchanged, though the_soviet_military_manpower_system was in a_state of rapid_decay.
the_ground_forces were traditionally manned through terms of conscription, which had been reduced in 1967 from three_to_two_years.
the_soviet_military_manpower_system was administered through the_thousands of military_commissariats (russian: военный_комиссариат, военкомат,_voyenkomat) located throughout the_soviet_union.
between january and may of each_year, every_young_soviet_male_citizen was required to report to the_local_voyenkomat for assessment for military_service, following a_summons based on lists from every_school and employer in the_area.
the_voyenkomat worked to quotas sent out by a_department of the_general_staff, listing how_many_young_men were required by each_service and branch of the_armed_forces.
since the_fall of the_soviet_union, draft_evasion has skyrocketed; officials regularly bemoan the_ten_or_so_percent that actually appear when summoned.)
the_new_conscripts were then picked up by an_officer from the_new_conscripts future unit and usually sent by train across the_country.
on arrival, the_new_conscripts would begin the_young_soldiers'_course, and become part of the_system of senior_rule, known as dedovshchina,_literally_"rule by the_grandfathers.
there is little_available_information on the_current_status of women, who are not conscripted, in the_russian_ground_forces.
according to the_bbc, there were 90,000_women in the_russian_army in 2002, though estimates on numbers of women across the_entire_russian_armed_forces in 2000 ranged from 115,000 to 160,000.
women serve in support_roles, most commonly in the_fields of nursing, communications, and engineering.
some_officers'_wives have become contract_service_personnel.
==_equipment ==
the_russian_ground_forces retain a_very_large_quantity of vehicles and equipment.
there is also likely to be a_great_deal of older_equipment in state_military_storage, a practice continued from the_soviet_union.
however, following the_collapse of the_ussr, the_newly_independent_republics became host to most of the_formations with modern_equipment, whereas russia was left with lower-category_units, usually with older_equipment.
as financial_stringency began to bite harder, the_amount of new_equipment fell as well, and by 1998, only_ten_tanks and about_30_bmp_infantry_fighting_vehicles were being purchased each year.
new_equipment, like the_armata_universal_combat_platform, bumerang and kurganets-25 will be equipped from 2015 and replace many_old_tanks, bmps, btrs like the_t-72,_t-90,_bmp-1/2/3, and btr-80 in active_service.
funding for new_equipment has greatly risen in recent_years, and the_russian_defence_industry continues to develop new_weapons_systems for the_ground_forces.
level of modern_weapons in the_ground_forces is 60 per cent in late 2019.
two_iskander-m_missile_system_brigade_sets, over_60_tornado-g_mlrs and more_than_20_msta-sm_self-propelled_howitzers have been received in 2016.
more_than_70_upgraded_grad-m_mlrs have been fielded too.
the_ground_forces received two_brigade_sets of buk-m3_and_buk-m2_air_defence_missile_complexes in 2016.
troops also received two_division_sets of tor-m2 and two of tor-m2u air defence missile complexes.
moreover, the_ground_forces received verba_manpads, more_than_130_bmp-3_ifvs and btr-82a_apcs as well as more_than_20_tigr-m_armored_vehicles equipped with the_arbalet-dm_combat_module.
russian_troops have reportedly received 2,930_new_or_modernized_systems allowing for two_missile_brigades, two_sam_brigades and two_sam_regiments, one_spetsnaz_brigade, 12_motorized_rifle_and_tank_battalions, and three_artillery_divisions to be reequipped.
the_share of modern_weapons and equipment in the_ground_forces from 2012 to 2020 increased by 4_times.
over eight_years, more_than_2.5_thousand_units of armored_weapons have been delivered to tank_formations and military_units of the_ground_forces, including more_than_1,000_upgraded_tanks
t-72b3m, t-80bvm and
russian_troops received more_than_1.5_thousand_units of infantry_fighting_vehicles bmp-3, upgraded bmp-2_and_armored_personnel_carriers btr-82a (am).
the_missile_forces and artillery of the_ground_forces from 2012 to 2020 received over_1.5_thousand_units of military_equipment_-_operational-tactical_missile_systems_iskander-m",_multiple_launch_rocket_systems of the_"tornado"_family,_self-propelled_howitzers "msta-sm".
air_defense_troops of the_ground_forces received over_900_units of military_equipment_-_long-range_anti-aircraft_missile_systems s-300v4, short-range_and_medium-range_anti-aircraft_missile_systems_"tor-m2" and "buk-m3", portable_anti-aircraft_missile_systems "verba".
equipment_summary ===
figures listed as "active" only include equipment that circulated in active_service.
ranks and insignia ==
the_newly_re-emergent_russia retained most of the_ranks of the_soviet_army, with some_minor_changes.
the_principal_difference from the_usual_western_style is some_variation in generals'_rank_titles—in at_least_one_case, colonel_general, derived from german_usage.
most of the_rank_names were borrowed from existing german/prussian, french, english, dutch, and polish ranks upon the_formation of the_soviet_army the_soviet_army in the_late_17th_century, and have lasted with few_changes of title through the_soviet_period.

ground_forces_day ==
on 31_may 2006, president_vladimir_putin signed decree no.
on the_establishment of professional_holidays and memorable_days in the_armed_forces of the_russian_federation", according to which it was ordered to celebrate ground_forces_day (russian:_день_сухопутных_войск).
the_date chosen for the_holiday commemorates the_edict made by tsar_ivan the terrible on 1_october 1550 on the_placement in moscow and surrounding districts of a_thousand_servicemen forming a_local_brigade of streltsy, which essentially became a_key_document in the_further_formation and development of the_imperial_russian_army.
ground_forces_day_(russian:
день_сухопутных_войск) was first celebrated on the_preobrazhenskaya_square in moscow in the_church of the_transfiguration of the_lord, where a_bishop's_service was held.
before the_start of the_service, an_order of the minister of defense sergei shoigu and the_decree of patriarch_kirill of moscow were read, according to which the_cathedral of the_transfiguration of the_lord officially became the_main_temple of the_rf_ground_forces.
a year later, the_holiday was celebrated with the_adoption of the_ground_forces_anthem.
the_following_holidays are also celebrated by the_ground_forces:
day of tankmen, day of rocket_forces and artillery, day of air_defense.

the_colt ar-15 is a_lightweight,_magazine-fed,_gas-operated_semi-automatic_rifle.
the_"ar” stands for the_first_two_letters of armalite.
the_"ar” was designed with the_extensive_use of aluminum_alloys and synthetic_materials in order to reduce weight.
colt's_manufacturing_company currently uses the_ar-15_trademark for colt's_manufacturing_company line of semi-automatic_ar-15_rifles.
due to financial_problems, and limitations in terms of manpower and production_capacity, armalite sold the_ar-15_design and the_ar-15_trademark along with armalite ar-10 to colt's_manufacturing_company in 1959.
colt started selling the_semi-automatic_version of the_m16_rifle as the colt ar-15 in 1964.
the_first_mass_production_version was the_colt_ar-15_sporter, in .223 remington, with a_20-inch_barrel and issued with 5-round_magazines.
over the_decades, colt has made many_different_types of ar-15_rifle_and_carbine_models, including the_ar-15,_ar-15a2, ar-15a3, ar-15a4, and many_other_models.
although the_sale of new_ar-15s was banned by the_federal_assault_weapons_ban from 1994 to 2004, colt and others continued to sell legally_compliant_versions during that_period.
on september 20, 2019, colt announced that colt would no longer produce the_ar-15 for private_use, due to market_saturation.
colt would still produce the_ar-15 for police_and_military_units though.
however, by may 2020, changed market_conditions and a_significant_increase in demand allowed colt to resume production for sales to private_users.
operating_mechanism ==
u.s._patent 2,951,424 describes the_cycling_mechanism used in the original ar-15.
the_bolt_carrier acts as a_movable_cylinder and the_bolt itself acts as a_stationary_piston.
operating_mechanism == is often called "direct gas impingement" (dgi), although operating_mechanism == differs from prior_gas_systems.
designer_eugene_stoner did not consider the_ar-15 to be a_conventional_direct_impingement_mechanism, but that is how the_ar-15 came to be characterized.
gas is tapped from the_barrel as the_bullet moves past a_gas_port located above the_rifle's_front_sight_base.
gas expands into a_gas_port located above the_rifle's_front_sight_base and down a_gas_tube, located above the_barrel that runs from the_front_sight_base into the_ar-15's_upper_receiver.
here, the_gas_tube protrudes into a_"gas_key" (bolt_carrier_key), which accepts gas and funnels the_gas_tube into the_bolt_carrier.
at this_point, the_bolt is locked into the_barrel_extension by locking lugs, so the_expanding_gas_forces
the_bolt_carrier backward a_short_distance.
as  the_bolt_carrier moves toward the_butt of the_gun, the_bolt_cam_pin, riding in a_slot on  the_bolt_carrier, forces the_bolt to rotate and thus unlocks the_bolt from the_barrel_extension.
once the_bolt is fully unlocked the_bolt begins the_bolt rearward movement along with  the_bolt carrier.
the_bolt's_rearward_motion extracts the_empty_cartridge_case from the_chamber.
as soon as the_neck of the_case clears the_barrel_extension, the_bolt's spring-loaded ejector forces the_bolt out the_ejection_port in the_side of the_upper_receiver.
behind the_bolt_carrier is a_plastic_or_metal_buffer, which rests in line with a_return_spring.
the_buffer_spring begins to push the_bolt_carrier and bolt back toward the_chamber once the_bolt_carrier is compressed sufficiently.
a_groove machined into the_upper_receiver guides the_bolt_cam_pin and prevents the_bolt_cam_pin and the_bolt from rotating into a_closed_position.
the_bolt's_locking_lugs push a_fresh_round from the_magazine as the_bolt moves forward.
a_fresh_round is guided by feed_ramps into the_chamber.
as the_bolt's_locking_lugs move past the_barrel_extension, the_cam_pin twists into a_pocket milled into the_upper_receiver.
this_twisting_action follows the groove cut into the_carrier and forces the_bolt to twist and "lock" into the_barrel_extension.
features == ===
upper_receivers ===
the_upper_receiver incorporates the_fore_stock, the_charging_handle, the_forward_assist, the_gas_operating_system, the_barrel, the_bolt_and_bolt_carrier_assembly.
ar-15s employ a_modular_design.
thus one_upper_receiver can quickly and easily be substituted for another.
upper_receivers are available with barrels of different_weights, lengths, calibers, and rail_systems with various_sights and accessories.
the_standard_ar-15_rifle uses a_20-inch_(510_mm)_barrel.
although, both_shorter_16-inch_(410_mm) carbine barrels and longer 24-inch
(610 mm) target_barrels are also available.
early_models had barrels with a_1:12_rate of twist for the_original_223_remington, 55-grain (3.6_g) bullets.
current_models have barrels with a_1:9_or_1:7_twist_rate for the_5.56×45mm_nato,_62-grain_(4.0_g)_bullets.
lower_receivers ===
the_lower_receiver incorporates the_magazine well, the_pistol_grip, the_buttstock, the_buffer and the_buffer spring.
the_lower_receiver also contains the_trigger, disconnector, hammer and fire_selector (collectively known as the_fire_control_group).
full-sized_rifles use a_fixed_buttstock, while carbines generally use an_adjustable_telescoping_buttstock.
the_early_commercial_sp-1_ar-15s used a pair of 0.250-inch (6.4_mm) diameter receiver push pins, identical to those found on the_military_rifles.
in 1966 the_company replaced the_front_pin with a_paired_nut and screw hinge using a 0.315-inch (8.0_mm) diameter_pin to prevent shooters from being able to change receivers with military_rifles or competitor_rifles without the_use of an_adapter.
receivers with military_rifles or competitor_rifles resumed production with the smaller and standardized 0.250 in pin in the_mid-1990s.
sights ===
the_ar-15's_most_distinctive_ergonomic_feature is the_carrying_handle and rear_sight_assembly on top of the_receiver.
this is a_by-product of the_original_armalite_design, where the_carry handle served to protect the_charging_handle.
as the_line of sight is 2.5 in (63.5_mm) over the_bore,
the_ar-15 has an_inherent_parallax_problem.
at closer_ranges (typically inside 15–20_meters), the_shooter must compensate by aiming high to place shots where desired.
the_standard_ar-15_rifle has a 500 mm (19.75_inches) sight radius.
the_ar-15 uses an_l-type_flip, aperture_rear_sight and
the_ar-15 is adjustable with two_settings, 0_to_300_meters and 300_to_400_meters.
the_front_sight is a_post adjustable for elevation.
the_front_sight can be adjusted for windage.
the_sights can be adjusted with a_bullet_tip or pointed_tool.
the_ar-15 can also mount a_scope on the_carrying_handle.
with the_advent of the_ar-15a2, a_new_fully_adjustable_rear_sight was added, allowing a_new_fully_adjustable_rear_sight to be dialed in for specific_range_settings between 300_and_800_meters and to allow windage_adjustments without the_need of a_tool or cartridge.
current_versions such as ar-15a4 have a_detachable_carrying_handle and use picatinny_rails, which allows for the_use of various_scopes and sighting_devices.
muzzle_devices ==
colt_ar-15_rifles most often have a_barrel threaded in ​1⁄2″-28_threads to incorporate the_use of a_muzzle_device such as a_flash_suppressor, sound_suppressor or muzzle_brake.
the_initial_design, the_"duckbill," had three_tines or prongs and was prone to breakage and getting entangled in vegetation.
the_initial_design, the_"duckbill," was later changed to close the_end to avoid this_problem.
eventually, on the_a2_version of the_rifle, the_bottom_port was closed to reduce muzzle_climb and prevent dust from rising when the_rifle was fired in the_prone_position.
for these_reasons, the_us_military declared this_muzzle device a_compensator, but it is more commonly known as the_"gi",_"a2", or "birdcage"_muzzle_device.
the_standard_ar15_muzzle_device conforms to the_stanag_dimensional_requirements for firing 22mm_rifle_grenades.
magazines ===
the_colt ar-15 uses 20-_or_30-round_staggered-column_detachable_box_magazines.
low-capacity 5- or 10-round magazines are also available to comply with legal_restrictions, for hunting, for benchrest_shooting or where a_larger_magazine can be inconvenient.
comparison to military_versions ===
the_primary_distinction between civilian_semi-automatic_rifles (no longer manufactured by colt for civilian_use) and military_models is select_fire.
military_rifles were produced with firing_modes,_semi-automatic_fire and either_fully_automatic_fire_mode or burst_fire_mode, in which the_rifle fires three_rounds in succession when the_trigger is depressed.
most_components are interchangeable between semi-auto_and_select_fire_rifles including magazines, sights, upper_receiver, barrels and accessories.
the_military_m4_carbine typically uses a_14.5-inch_(370_mm)_barrel.
civilian_rifles commonly have 16-inch_or_longer_barrels to comply with the_national_firearms_act.
in order to prevent a civilian semi-automatic ar-15 from being readily converted for use with the_select_fire_components, colt changed a_number of features.
parts changed include the_lower_receiver, bolt_carrier, hammer, trigger, disconnector, and safety/mode_selector.
the_semi-automatic_bolt_carrier has a_longer_lightening_slot to prevent the_bolt's_engagement with an_automatic_sear.
due to a_decrease in mass the_buffer_spring is heavier.
on the_select_fire_version, the_hammer has an_extra_spur which interacts with the_additional_auto-sear that holds the_hammer back until the_bolt_carrier_group is fully in battery, when automatic_fire is selected.
using a_portion of the_select_fire_parts in a_semi-automatic_rifle will not enable a_select_fire_option.
as designed by colt the_pins supporting the_semi-auto_trigger and hammer in the_lower_receiver are larger than those used in the_military_rifle to prevent interchangeability between semi-automatic_and_select_fire_components.
ar-15_style_rifle ==
after colt's_patents expired in 1977, other_manufacturers began to copy the_colt_ar-15_rifle's_design.
however, the_term "ar-15" is a_colt_registered_trademark and colt only uses the_term to refer to a_colt_registered_trademark and colt line of semi-automatic_rifles.
therefore, other_manufacturers began to market other_manufacturers generic_ar-15s under separate_designations, although these are all frequently referred to as ar-15s, as are some_rifles and carbines that are not even based on the_ar-15_design.
style_rifles are available in a_wide_range of configurations and calibers from a_large_number of manufacturers.
configurations and calibers from a_large_number of manufacturers range from standard_full-sizes_rifles with 20-inch_barrels, to short_carbine-length_models with 16-inch_barrels, adjustable_length_stocks and optical_sights, to long_range_target_models with 24-inch_barrels, bipods and high-powered_scopes.
style_rifles may also have short-stroke_gas_piston_system, forgoing the_direct_gas_system_standard in ar-15_rifles.
style_rifles include the_5.56×45mm nato, 5.7×28mm, 6.8mm_remington_spc, .300
blackout, 9×19mm parabellum and .458_socom to name a few.
== use in mass_shootings ==
from 28–29_april, 1996, martin_bryant killed 35 and injured 23 in an_incident known today as the_port_arthur_massacre, during which martin_bryant used a colt ar-15 and a_.308_l1a1_slr.
it was one of the_deadliest_mass_shootings in australian_history and resulted in the_1996_national_firearms_agreement.
legality ==
the_colt ar-15 is banned by name in california with a_list of additional_ar-style_and_ak-style_firearms in the_kasler v. lockyer_assault_weapons_list.
a_list of additional_ar-style_and_ak-style_firearms in the_kasler v.
lockyer_assault_weapons_list deems the_colt ar-15, as well as the armalite ar-15, bushmaster xm-15, dpms panther, and many other ar-style rifles as assault_weapons by name, thus illegal to own/possess in the_state of california.

a_directed-energy_weapon (dew) is a_ranged_weapon that damages a_directed-energy_weapon (dew) target with highly_focused_energy, including laser, microwaves, and particle_beams.
potential_applications of this_technology include weapons that target personnel, missiles, vehicles, and optical_devices.
in the_united_states, the pentagon, darpa, the air force research laboratory, united states
army_armament_research_development and engineering_center, and the_naval_research_laboratory are researching directed-energy_weapons and railguns to counter ballistic_missiles, hypersonic_cruise_missiles, and hypersonic_glide_vehicles.
these_systems of missile_defense are expected to come online no sooner than the_mid to late-2020s.
russia, china, india, and the_united_kingdom are also developing directed-energy_weapons while iran and turkey claim to have directed-energy_weapons in active_service and the first usage of directed-energy_weapons in a_combat was claimed to have occurred in libya in august 2019 by turkey which claimed to use the_alka_directed-energy_weapon.
after decades of research and development, directed-energy_weapons are still at the_experimental_stage and it remains to be seen if or when directed-energy_weapons will be deployed as practical,_high-performance_military_weapons.
operational_advantages ==
directed_energy_weapons could have several_main_advantages over conventional_weaponry
: directed-energy_weapons can be used discreetly; radiation above and below the_visible_spectrum is invisible and does not generate sound.
light is, for all_practical_purposes, essentially unaffected by gravity, windage and coriolis force, giving  light an_almost_perfectly_flat_trajectory.
this makes aim much more precise and extends the_range to line-of-sight, limited only by beam_diffraction and spread (which dilute the_power and weaken the_effect), and absorption or scattering by intervening atmospheric_contents.
lasers travel at light-speed and have near infinite_range and are therefore suitable for use in space_warfare.
laser_weapons potentially eliminate many_logistical_problems in terms of ammunition_supply, as long as there is enough_energy to power ammunition_supply.
depending on several_operational_factors, directed-energy_weapons may be cheaper to operate than conventional_weapons in certain_contexts.
microwave_weapons ==
although some_devices are labeled as microwave_weapons, the_microwave_range is commonly defined as being between 300_mhz and 300_ghz, which is within the_rf_range—these_frequencies having wavelengths of 1_millimeter to 1_meter.
some_examples of weapons which have been publicized by the_military are as follows:
active_denial_system is a_millimeter_wave_source that heats the_water in a_human_target's_skin and thus causes incapacitating_pain.
it was developed by the_u.s._air_force_research_laboratory and raytheon for riot-control_duty.
though intended to cause severe_pain while leaving no_lasting_damage, concern has been voiced as to whether the_system could cause irreversible_damage to the_eyes.
there has yet to be testing for long-term_side_effects of exposure to the_microwave_beam.
it can also destroy unshielded_electronics.
the_device comes in various_sizes, including attached to a_humvee.
vigilant_eagle is a_proposed_airport_defense_system that directs high-frequency_microwaves towards any_projectile that is fired at an_aircraft.
a_proposed_airport_defense_system that directs high-frequency_microwaves towards any_projectile that is fired at an_aircraft consists of a_missile-detecting_and_tracking_subsystem (mdt), a_command_and_control_system, and a_scanning_array.
the_mdt is a_fixed_grid of passive_infrared_(ir)_cameras.
the_command_and_control_system determines the_missile_launch_point.
the_scanning_array_projects microwaves that disrupt the surface-to-air missile's guidance system, deflecting the surface-to-air missile's guidance system from an_aircraft.
bofors_hpm_blackout is a_high-powered_microwave_weapon that is said to be able to destroy at short_distance a_wide_variety of commercial off-the-shelf (cots) electronic equipment and is purportedly non-lethal.
the_effective_radiated_power (erp) of the_el/m-2080_green_pine_radar makes the_el/m-2080_green_pine_radar a hypothetical candidate for conversion into a_directed-energy_weapon, by focusing pulses of radar_energy on target_missiles.
the_energy_spikes are tailored to enter missiles through antennas or sensor_apertures where the_energy_spikes can fool guidance_systems, scramble computer_memories or even burn out sensitive_electronic_components.
aesa_radars mounted on fighter_aircraft have been slated as directed_energy_weapons against missiles, however, a_senior_us_air_force_officer noted: "aesa_radars aren't particularly suited to create weapons_effects on missiles because of limited_antenna_size, power and field of view".
potentially lethal_effects are produced only inside 100_meters_range, and disruptive_effects at distances on the_order of one_kilometer.
moreover, cheap_countermeasures can be applied to existing_missiles.
counter-electronics high_power microwave advanced missile project ==
laser_weapons ==
a_laser_weapon is a_directed-energy_weapon based on lasers.
== particle-beam_weapons == particle-beam_weapons can use charged_or_neutral_particles, and can be either endoatmospheric or exoatmospheric.
particle_beams as beam_weapons are theoretically possible, but practical_weapons have not been demonstrated yet.
certain_types of particle_beams have the_advantage of being self-focusing in the_atmosphere.
blooming is also a_problem in particle-beam_weapons.
energy that would otherwise be focused on the_target spreads out and the_beam becomes less effective:
thermal_blooming occurs in both_charged_and_neutral_particle_beams, and occurs when particles bump into one another under the_effects of thermal_vibration, or bump into air_molecules.
electrical_blooming occurs only in charged_particle_beams, as ions of like charge repel one another.
plasma_weapons ===
plasma_weapons fire a_beam, bolt, or stream of plasma, which is an_excited_state of matter consisting of atomic_electrons & nuclei and free_electrons if ionized, or other_particles if pinched.
the_marauder (magnetically_accelerated_ring to achieve ultra-high_directed-energy and radiation) used the_shiva_star_project (a_high_energy_capacitor_bank which provided the_means to test weapons and other_devices requiring brief_and_extremely_large_amounts of energy) to accelerate a_toroid of plasma at a_significant_percentage of the_speed of light.
the_russian_federation is developing plasma_weapons.
sonic_weapons ==
tests performed on mice show the_threshold for both_lung_and_liver_damage occurs at
about_184_db._damage increases rapidly as intensity is increased.
noise-induced_neurological_disturbances in humans exposed to continuous_low_frequency_tones for durations longer than 15 minutes involved development of immediate_and_long-term_problems affecting brain_tissue.
the_symptoms resembled those of individuals who had suffered minor_head_injuries.
one_theory for a_causal_mechanism is that the_prolonged_sound_exposure resulted in enough_mechanical_strain to brain_tissue to induce an_encephalopathy.
long_range_acoustic_device (lrad) ===
the_long_range_acoustic_device (lrad) is an_acoustic_hailing_device developed by lrad corporation to send messages and warning tones over longer_distances or at higher_volume than normal_loudspeakers.
lrad_systems are used for long-range_communications in a_variety of applications including as a_means of non-lethal,_non-kinetic_crowd_control.
according to the_manufacturer's_specifications, lrad_systems weigh from 15_to_320_pounds (6.8 to 145.1_kg) and can emit sound in a_30°-_60°_beam at 2.5_khz.
history == ==
=_mirrors of archimedes ===
according to a_legend, archimedes created a_mirror with an_adjustable_focal_length (or more likely, a_series of mirrors focused on a_common_point) to focus sunlight on ships of the_roman_fleet as they invaded syracuse, setting they on fire.
historians point out that the_earliest_accounts of the_battle did not mention a_"burning_mirror", but merely stated that archimedes's_ingenuity combined with a_way to hurl fire were relevant to the_victory.
some_attempts to replicate this_feat have had some_success; in_particular,_an_experiment by students at mit showed that a_mirror-based_weapon was at least possible, if not necessarily practical.
the_hosts of mythbusters tackled the_mirrors of archimedes three times (in episodes 19, 57 and 172) and were never able to make the_target_ship catch fire, declaring the_myth busted three_separate_times.
robert_watson-watt ===
in 1935, the_british_air_ministry asked robert_watson-watt of the_radio_research_station whether a_"death_ray" was possible.
robert_watson-watt of the_radio_research_station and colleague_arnold_wilkins quickly concluded that it was not feasible, but as a_consequence suggested using radio for the_detection of aircraft and this started the_development of radar in britain.
the_fictional_"engine-stopping_ray" ===
stories in the_1930s and world_war_two gave rise to the_idea of an_"engine-stopping_ray".
stories in the_1930s and world_war_two seemed to have arisen from the_testing of the_television_transmitter in feldberg, germany.
because electrical_noise from car_engines would interfere with field_strength_measurements, sentries would stop all_traffic in the_vicinity for the_twenty_minutes or so needed for a_test.
reversing the_order of events in retelling the_story created a_"tale" where tourists_car_engine stopped first and then were approached by a_german_soldier who told them that them had to wait.
the_soldier returned a short time later to say that the_engine would now work and the_tourists drove off.
such_stories were circulating in britain around 1938 and during the_war british_intelligence relaunched the_myth as a_"british_engine-stopping_ray," trying to spoof the_germans into researching what the_british had supposedly invented in an_attempt to tie up german_scientific_resources.
german_world_war_ii_experimental_weapons ===
during the_early_1940s_axis_engineers developed a_sonic_cannon that could cause fatal_vibrations in the_early_1940s_axis_engineers target body.
a_methane_gas_combustion_chamber leading to two_parabolic_dishes pulse-detonated at roughly_44_hz.
this_sound, magnified by the_dish_reflectors, caused vertigo and nausea at 200–400_meters (220–440_yd) by vibrating the_middle_ear bones and shaking the_cochlear_fluid within the_inner_ear.
at distances of 50–200_meters (160–660_ft), the_sound_waves could act on organ_tissues and fluids by repeatedly compressing and releasing compressive_resistant_organs such as the_kidneys, spleen, and liver.
it had little_detectable_effect on malleable_organs such as the_heart, stomach and intestines.)
lung_tissue was affected at only_the_closest_ranges as atmospheric_air is highly compressible and only_the_blood_rich_alveoli resist compression.
in practice, the_weapon was highly vulnerable to enemy_fire.
rifle, bazooka_and_mortar_rounds easily deformed the_parabolic_reflectors, rendering the_wave_amplification ineffective.
in the_later_phases of world_war_ii, nazi_germany increasingly put nazi_germany hopes on research into technologically_revolutionary_secret_weapons, the_wunderwaffe.
among the_directed-energy_weapons the_nazis investigated were x-ray_beam_weapons developed under heinz_schmellenmeier, richard_gans and fritz_houtermans.
these built an_electron_accelerator called rheotron (invented by max_steenbeck at siemens-schuckert in the_1930s, these were later called betatrons by the_americans) to generate hard_x-ray_synchrotron_beams for the reichsluftfahrtministerium (rlm).
the_intent was to pre-ionize ignition in aircraft_engines and hence serve as anti-aircraft_dew and bring planes down into the_reach of the_flak.
the_rheotron was captured by the_americans in burggrub on april 14, 1945.another_approach was ernst_schiebolds_'röntgenkanone' developed from 1943 in großostheim near aschaffenburg.
richert_seifert & co from hamburg delivered parts.
reported_use in sino-soviet_conflicts ===
the_central_intelligence_agency informed secretary_henry_kissinger that the_central_intelligence_agency had twelve_reports of soviet_forces using laser-based_weapons against chinese_forces during the_1969_sino-soviet_border_clashes, though william_colby doubted that they had actually been employed.
strategic_defense_initiative ===
in the_1980s, u.s._president_ronald_reagan proposed the_strategic_defense_initiative_(sdi)_program, which was nicknamed star wars.
it suggested that lasers, perhaps space-based_x-ray_lasers, could destroy icbms in flight.
panel_discussions on the_role of high-power_lasers in sdi took place at various_laser_conferences, during the_1980s, with the_participation of noted_physicists including edward_teller.
though the_strategic_missile_defense_concept has continued to the_present under the_missile_defense_agency, most of the_directed-energy_weapon_concepts were shelved.
however, boeing has been somewhat successful with the boeing yal-1 and boeing nc-135, the first of which destroyed two_missiles in february 2010.
funding has been cut to both of the_programs.
iraq_war ===
during iraq war ===, electromagnetic_weapons, including high_power_microwaves, were used by the_u.s._military to disrupt and destroy iraqi_electronic_systems and may have been used for crowd_control.
types and magnitudes of exposure to electromagnetic_fields are unknown.
alleged_tracking of space_shuttle_challenger ===
the_soviet_union invested some_effort in the_development of ruby_and_carbon_dioxide_lasers as anti-ballistic_missile_systems, and later as a_tracking_and_anti-satellite_system.
there are reports that the_terra-3_complex at sary_shagan was used on several_occasions to temporarily_"blind"_us_spy_satellites in the_ir_range.
the_terra-3_complex at sary_shagan has been claimed (and proven false) that the_ussr made use of the_lasers at the_terra-3_site to target the_space_shuttle_challenger in 1984.
at the_time, the_soviet_union were concerned that the_shuttle was being used as a_reconnaissance_platform.
on 10_october 1984 (sts-41-g), the_terra-3 tracking laser was allegedly aimed at challenger as the_terra-3 tracking laser passed over the_facility.
early_reports claimed that this was responsible for causing "malfunctions on the_space_shuttle and distress to the_crew", and that the_united_states filed a_diplomatic_protest about the_incident.
however, this_story is comprehensively denied by the_crew_members of sts-41-g and knowledgeable_members of the_us_intelligence_community.
after the_end of the_cold_war, the_facility was found to be a_low-power_laser_testing_site with limited_satellite_tracking_capabilities, which is now abandoned and partially disassembled.
planetary_defense ==
in the_united_states, the_directed_energy_solar_targeting of asteroids and exploration_(de-star)_project was considered for non-military_use to protect earth from asteroids.
non-lethal_weapons ==
the_tecom_technology_symposium in 1997 concluded on non-lethal_weapons, "determining the_target_effects on personnel is the_greatest_challenge to the_testing_community", primarily because  "the_potential of injury and death severely limits human_tests".
also,_"directed-energy_weapons that target the_central_nervous_system and cause neurophysiological_disorders may violate the_certain_conventional_weapons_convention of 1980.
weapons that go beyond non-lethal_intentions and cause 'superfluous_injury or unnecessary_suffering' may also violate the_protocol i to the_geneva_conventions of 1977."some_common_bio-effects of non-lethal_electromagnetic_weapons include: difficulty breathing disorientation_nausea_pain
other_systemic_discomfortinterference with breathing_poses
the_most_significant,_potentially_lethal_results.
light and repetitive_visual_signals can induce epileptic_seizures.
vection and motion_sickness can also occur.
cruise_ships are known to use sonic_weapons (such as lrad) to drive off pirates.
russia has been reportedly using blinding_laser_weapons during russia military intervention in donbass.

this is a_list of equipment of the_british_army currently in use.
this includes small_arms, combat_vehicles, aircraft, watercraft, artillery and transport vehicles.
the_british_army is the_principal_land_warfare_force of the_united_kingdom, a_part of british_armed_forces.
since the_end of the_cold_war, the_british_army has been deployed to a_number of conflict_zones, often as part of an_expeditionary_force, a_coalition_force or part of a_united_nations_peacekeeping_operation.
to meet the_british_army_commitments, the_equipment of the_british_army the_british_army is periodically updated and modified.
programs exist to ensure the_army is suitably equipped for both_current_conflicts and expected future_conflicts, with any_shortcomings in equipment addressed as urgent_operational_requirements (uor), which supplements planned_equipment_programmes.
infantry_section_equipment ==
the_british_infantry_section consists of eight_men who are normally organised into two_four-man_infantry_fireteams.
while equipment_formations can be tailored as required by section_and_platoon_commanders, infantry_sections are usually issued with the_following:

personal_equipment == ===
protective_equipment === ===
helmet ===
many_soldiers are now equipped with the_new_virtus_helmet (revision_batlskin_cobra_plus) which provides increased_blunt_impact_protection, has a_lighter_weight than the_preceding_mk7, can be fitted with face and mandible_guards for certain_roles, is specially shaped to allow effective_weapon_usage while in a_prone_position and wearing body_armour, and features a_permanent_universal_night_vision_mount and a_scalable_counterweight attached to the_helmet's_rear in order to ease strain on the_user's_neck while a_night_vision_device is equipped.
prior to this, the_standard_helmet in service was the_mk7 which replaced the_older_mk6 and mk6a_helmets on operations.
the_mk7_helmet offered the_same_protection as the_mk6a but had a_lower_weight and was equipped with a_new_harness that kept the_helmet more stable on the_head when night_vision_equipment was fitted.
the_shape of the_helmet was better integrated with new_weapon_sights compared to the_mk6a, making it easier to use in a_variety of fighting_positions.
all_helmets allow the_soldier to wear a_respirator, hearing protection, goggles and/or a radio headset as necessary.
combat_body_armour ===
the_british_army utilises three_combat_body_armour_systems.
for training_activities, old_stocks of enhanced_combat_body_armour are utilised; first introduced in the_1980s, this is a_soft_body_armour_vest that can be augmented with hard_armour_plates.
for operational_activities since 2006, soldiers have been issued with a_combined_soft_and_hard_body_armour_vest known as osprey_body_armour, with the_latest_iteration being the_mk_4_and_mk_4a_'osprey_assault'_body_armour.
the_osprey_mk_4_vest provides the_same_level of ballistic_protection as older_osprey_vests while improving the_comfort of personnel on operations by being closer fitting, less bulky and easier to move in; this is aided by having a_thinner_hard_armour_plate which is carried in an_internal_pocket as opposed to the_external_pockets of enhanced_combat_body_armour and earlier_osprey_vests.
a new ribbed material lining on the_inside of the_osprey_mk_4_vest improves breathability in hotter_climates such as that of afghanistan.
the_mk_4a_version achieves a_further_weight_reduction by switching from a_cummerbund to a_smaller_side_plate_pouch.
all_versions of osprey_body_armour are modular in that molle loops on the_outside of the_vest allow soldiers to attach various_load carrying pouches to suit soldiers_role, with the_osprey_mk 4 having a_higher_number of loops and introducing new_pouches such as a_"commander's_pouch" for holding stationery and open_magazine_pouches with elastic_draw-cords for easier_access to ammunition (though pouches with velcro_flaps and fastex_fastenings were also included).
osprey_mk_4_and_mk_4a_body_armour has mostly been replaced by the_scalable_tactical_vest_component of virtus_body_armour, which is even closer fitting and lighter than the_opsrey_mk 4 and can have the_opsrey_mk 4 level of protection scaled up or down to match the_prevailing_type of threat.
the_vest also features a_quick-release_mechanism to aid safe_extraction from hazardous_situations such as burning vehicles or drowning and a_dynamic_weight_distribution_system which, when linked to a_soldier's_waist_belt, aids in spreading the_soldier's_load across the_back, shoulders, and hips; a_mechanism in the_small of the_back allows the_wearer to adjust the_weight_bias depending on the_situation.
ancillary to regular_body_armour is a_three-tier_pelvic_armour_system issued since 2010 to mitigate against the_effects of blasts, including shrapnel.
the_first_layer is a_pair of underwear_shorts manufactured from a_ballistic_silk_material.
the_first_layer consists of detachable_pelvic_body_armour that is intended to be worn while 'outside the_wire' to meet the_greater_threats faced by soldiers on patrol;  the_first_layer can be rolled up and clipped to a_belt and then pulled through the_legs to form a_protective_pouch, ensuring that mobility is not impeded while  the_first_layer is worn.
the_first_layer consists of knee-length_ballistic_shorts worn over a_soldier's_combat_trousers, offering coverage of the_upper_leg and wider_abdominal_region and designed for use by soldiers operating hand-held_metal_detectors to search for explosive_devices or otherwise serving in a_combat_role where greater_levels of protection are required.
respirator ===
by january 2015, over_300,000_general_service_respirators had been delivered to replace the_older_s10_respirator.
300,000_general_service_respirators are also used by the_royal_navy, royal_air_force and royal_fleet_auxiliary.
uniforms === ===
in 2012, the_mod purchased a_newly_designed_range of brown_combat_boots from haix, alt-berg, and other_manufacturers for the_army, royal_navy and raf to replace the_black_and_desert_combat_footwear previously worn.
five_different_boots, developed to match the_multi-terrain_pattern_uniform, are available to armed_forces_personnel depending on where five_different_boots, developed to match the_multi-terrain_pattern_uniform are based and what_role five_different_boots, developed to match the_multi-terrain_pattern_uniform are in.
each of the_five_boot_types comes in two_different_styles, with personnel being able to wear the_particular_style they find most comfortable.
black_boots have been retained for wear with most_non-camouflage_uniforms as well as units on parade in full_dress_uniform, such as regiments performing ceremonial_duties in central_london.
desert_combat – worn by dismounted_troops conducting medium to high_levels of activity in desert_type_environments with temperatures exceeding 40_°c_desert_patrol – worn by drivers/armoured_troops conducting lower_levels of activity in desert_type_environments exceeding 40_°c_temperate_combat – worn by dismounted_troops for medium to high_levels of activity in temperate_(european)_climates_patrol – worn by mounted_troops (drivers/armoured_troops) taking part in lower_levels of activity in temperate_(european)_climates
cold_wet_weather – worn by dismounted_troops for medium_to_high_levels of activity in temperatures down to −20
c.before the_adoption of the_brown_boots, british_troops were issued with desert_combat_boots manufactured by meindl and lowa for use in afghanistan.
both_boots remain listed as part of the_mod's_'black_bag' of operational_clothing despite both_boots official replacement by the_brown_boots, and may be worn by individual_soldiers in lieu of the_issue_footwear.
personal_role_radio ===
a_personal_role_radio (prr) is distributed to every_member of an_eight-strong_infantry_section.
load carrying equipment ===
soldiers need to carry ammunition, water, food, protective_equipment, and various_other_supplies; personal_load_carrying_equipment (plce), officially known as 90_pattern_webbing, is the_current_webbing_system used by the_british_army for this_purpose.
the_webbing consists of a_belt, a_yoke_harness, and various_belt_pouches, as well as two_daysacks for use with the_combat_order; these can be attached to a_larger_'bergen'_rucksack for use with the_marching_order.
associated with plce is a_series of similar_load carrying equipment and rucksacks.
plce_webbing is capable of holding everything that a_soldier needs to operate for 24_hours without resupply in a_soldier fighting_order, for up_to_two_or_three_days without resupply in a_soldier combat_or_patrol_order and for up_to_two_weeks without resupply in a_soldier marching order.
plce is now very unlikely to be spotted during operations due to the_introduction of the_osprey_body_armour_series and the_later_virtus_scalable_tactical_vest, both of which feature molle_loops for direct_attachment of load carrying pouches as well as various_associated_load carrying items such as rucksacks that also feature molle_attachment_loops, though plce webbing produced in the_newer_mtp_pattern does exist and, due to its_durability and the_quantity produced,  plce webbing is often seen in use during training_exercises.
future_integrated_soldier technology ===
the_future_integrated_soldier_technology_(fist) is a_programme under development by the_ministry of defence.
the_programme is designed to achieve enhanced_military_effect through the used of advanced_technologies improving the_situational_awareness, lethality and survivability of soldiers.
ultimately,  the_programme is part of the_wider_british_armed_forces_doctrine of network-enabled_capability.
35,000_sets of kit are expected to be bought and issued between 2015 and 2020.
this_equipment is designed to bring the_british_infantryman up to standards and link with new_technology currently employed, including the_new_underslung_grenade_launcher for the_sa80 and the_deployed_bowman_communications_network.
it is not intended that every_soldier be equipped with fist: instead, unit_commanders will request fist kits as necessary so that unit_commanders can be tailored to the_situation and mission aims.

mobile artillery monitoring battlefield_radar ====
the_mobile_artillery_monitoring_battlefield_radar (or mobile_artillery_monitoring_battlefield_asset) is a_counter-battery_radar.
the_mobile_artillery_monitoring_battlefield_radar (or mobile_artillery_monitoring_battlefield_asset) detects enemy_artillery_projectiles fired by one_or_more_weapons and from their_trajectories locates the_position of the_weapon that fired the_mobile_artillery_monitoring_battlefield_radar (or mobile_artillery_monitoring_battlefield_asset).
it has a_detection_range of up_to_30_km and can process up-to_100_projectiles simultaneously.
it is mounted on a_bandvagn_206_(bv206)_all-terrain_vehicle.
five_vehicles are operated by the_5th_regiment_royal_artillery.
exactor ====
the_exactor is a_previously_classified_purchase of the_rafael_spike-nlos_missile_system.
the_rafael_spike-nlos_missile_system is primarily used for precise_indirect_counter_barrage_attacks at long_ranges (30_km (19_mi)) where the_gmlrs would result in too_much_collateral_damage.
the_rafael_spike-nlos_missile_system originally consisted of six_mk2 or mk4_missiles mounted on an_m113_chassis, of which 12 were purchased directly from the_israeli_defence_force with a_further_two_chassis leased.
in 2010, the_united_kingdom hired rafael to produce an_improved_mk_5_missile and also ditched the_m-113_based_launchers as the_m-113_based_launchers were poorly air-conditioned and difficult to keep running.
these_new_missiles were mounted on a_simpler_flatbed_trailer containing four_missiles each.
this_new_system was dubbed the exactor 2 by the_u.k._ministry of defence.
18_such_systems now exist within the_royal_artillery in six_batteries of three.
centurion_centurion is a_c-ram_system based on the_20mm_phalanx_ciws, originally acquired for used in basra, iraq.
it is operated by 16th_regiment_royal_artillery, and intended to intercept incoming_rockets, shells and mortars out to a_1.2_km_square_area.
incoming_rockets, shells and mortars are maintained by babcock_international in the_united_kingdom.
a_total of ten_sets were purchased in 2005, but since then four have been reconverted back to the_maritime_variant.
engineering and logistics ===
miscellaneous === ====
c_vehicle_fleet ====
the_job of the_royal_engineers is to restrict the_enemy's_ability to advance, while also allowing friendly_combat_forces the_freedom to maneuver as necessary.
other_tasks undertaken are bomb_disposal, the_construction of fortifications, runways, roads and bridges and the_improvement of existing_infrastructure to support operations – such as improving existing_roads for logistic_convoys.
to achieve this, the_royal_engineers operate a_large_and_diverse_fleet of vehicles.
at present, the_c_vehicle_fleet is provided by a_private_finance_initiative (pfi) and consists of some_2,500_vehicles of over_160_types of "earthmoving_plant, engineer_construction_plant (ecp) and rough_terrain
materials_handling_equipment (mhe)".
the_provider of the_pfi is amey_lex_consortium (alc), which was awarded a_15-year_contract in 2005 for £600 million.
the_handing over of the_c_vehicle_fleet to a_pfi has improved overall_efficiency, with alc selecting common_chassis for multiple_roles and significantly reducing equipment_types.
this has led to reduced_training_needs in personnel, commonality of spares and an_overall_reduction in the_logistic_footprint and cost of maintenance.
alc maintains the_c_vehicle_fleet at various_degrees of readiness, with a_large_pool of the_vehicles being modified and adapted for military_use – however, the_majority of the_c_vehicle_fleet is maintained at commercial_standards.
the_c_vehicle_fleet is dispersed worldwide to accommodate both_existing_and_future_operations.
when in use, the_vehicles are essentially being "hired on an_ad_hoc_basis".
to help sustain the_c_vehicle_fleet on operations, the_pfi includes a_logistics_support_package.
all-terrain_vehicles ===
there are a_number of all-terrain_vehicles in service with the_british_army.
the_supacat_atmp is a_lightweight_6×6 used by airborne_and_air-mobile_forces.
it can carry up_to_8_troops with a_standard_nato_pallet of stores and ammunition.
the_springer_all-terrain_vehicle is a_light-role_4×2_load_carriage_platform, which can self-load a_1-ton_pallet.
each_vehicle is equipped with an_8,000_lb_(3,600_kg)_self-recovery_winch and sand_ladders, which act as loading ramps for a_cargo_pallet.
approximately_900_grizzly_450_quad_bikes are used as light_transport for things such as mortars, ammunition and general_supplies.
finally, the_harley_davidson_mt350e_and_honda_r250_motorcycles are used by dispatch_riders and for a_variety of liaison_and_traffic_control_tasks.
special_forces ====
special_forces ==== maintain a_unique_fleet of vehicles to support special_forces ====_covert_operations.
in 2001, 65_supacat_high_mobility_transporter (hmt) 400_vehicles were ordered under project_minacity after being in development for a_special_forces_protected_vehicle_requirement since the_late_1990s.
400_vehicles entered service in 2003 in afghanistan.
in 2008, 24_australian_bushmaster_armoured_vehicles were purchased under an_uor for the_sas in iraq, as these provided all-round_protection unlike the_minacity.
the_minacity is fitted with additional_armour, counter-ied_electronics, and a_.50_calibre_machine_gun mounted in a_rws.
in addition, other_vehicles known to be in service are: 60_toyota_hilux for special_forces_mobility; and 78_acmat_vlras as tactical_support_vehicles to resupply and sustain special_forces on operations.
in august 2016, the_bbc reported that the_jankel_toyota_land_cruiser-based_al-thalab_long_range_patrol_vehicle was being used in syria.

watercraft == ===
raiding craft ===
the_raiding_craft in service with the_british_army are operated in large_numbers, predominately with the_royal_engineers and the_royal_logistic_corps, for supporting both_bridging_and_amphibious_operations.
the_raiding_craft in service with the_british_army are highly versatile and often find the_raiding_craft in service with the_british_army serving in environments ranging from the_arctic to the_tropics.
mk.4 workboat ===
four_boats in service, operated by the_royal_logistic_corps as small_tugs and general_purpose_work-boats in support of amphibious_operations.
four_boats in service, operated by the_royal_logistic_corps as small_tugs and general_purpose_work-boats in support of amphibious_operations have a_displacement of 48_tonnes and a_maximum_speed of 10_knots.
mexeflotes ===
mexeflotes === are amphibious_landing_raft operated by the_royal_logistic_corps for amphibious_operations and are designed to deliver both_armoured_vehicles and material from ship to shore.
they are deployed on the_16,160_tonne_bay-class_landing_ships of the_royal_fleet_auxiliary.
future_equipment ==
the_future_integrated_soldier_technology is a_suite of equipment capable of enhancing an_infantryman's_effectiveness as part of the_future_soldier_programme.
the_scout_sv known as "ajax" in british_service and the_scout_sv variants have been chosen to replace the_cvr(t)_family of vehicles.
ajax was due to go operational in 2019, however the first were delivered in early 2021 the_land_ceptor_missile_system will replace the_rapier by 2020.
a_new_body_armour_system known as virtus is under development as a_replacement for the_osprey_vest and mk.
the_mod has a_requirement for a_new_multi_role_vehicle under the multi role vehicle-protected.
at dsei_2015_general_dynamics_uk announced that dsei_2015_general_dynamics_uk would offer variants of dsei_2015_general_dynamics_uk ocelot (foxhound) and eagle_vehicles for the_requirement.
in july 2017, the_us_dsca notified the_us_congress of a_possible_sale of 2,747_jltv_vehicles and accessories to dsei_2015_general_dynamics_uk.
as of oct 2019 no_decision had been made.
the_british_army wants to purchase 8x8_wheeled_armoured_fighting_vehicles to replace the_mastiff and ridgeback in british_service.
this_program used to be part of fres_uv, later named simply uv (utility_vehicle) and now known as mechanised_infantry_vehicle (miv).
this_vehicle is intended to equip the_4_"heavy_protected_mobility"_battalions under army 2020 refine.
the_4_"heavy_protected_mobility"_battalions under army 2020 will also be part of the_two_strike_brigades proposed under the_strategic_defence_and_security_review 2015.
in 2018 the_uk rejoined the_boxer_afv_consortium and as of oct. 2019 are in negotiations with a_view to purchasing 500+ units.
on 5_november 2019, it was announced that a_£2.8_billion_deal for 500_boxer_armoured_vehicles had been signed.
deliveries would start in 2023.
senior_army_officers and procurement_officials are looking at either upgrading the_challenger 2 or outright replacing it.
at dsei 2015, army_officials expressed army_officials concern with the_challenger_2's_armament and its_inevitable_obsolescence in coming_years.
other_causes of concern are the_challengers_engine and electronics.
army stated that army had been in discussions with armoured_fighting_vehicle_manufacturers about the_future of the_tank_and_army_potential_replacement.
a_later_defense_news_article said that army would still proceed with army_challenger_2_lep, citing that a_replacement at the_present would be too costly.
on 22_december 2016, an_assessment_phase_award was awarded to bae_systems and rheinmetall_land_systeme_gmbh to progress the_challenger_2_life_extension_project.
under the_non-articulated_vehicle – protected_(nav-p)_program, the_mod is looking for a_successor to the_drops_vehicles.
this has resulted in a_contract placed in 2018 for the_conversion of 382_man_hx77_support_vehicles to carry the_epls (enhanced_palletised_load_system)_equipment.
they are due to fully enter service in march 2021.
a_contract placed in 2018 for the_conversion of 382_man_hx77_support_vehicles to carry the_epls (enhanced_palletised_load_system)_equipment includes the_conversion of 33_winterised/waterproofed_versions
the_army is currently in the_process of receiving 56_harris_corporation t7_eod_unmanned_ground_vehicles (ugv), procured by de&s under project_starter.
these_systems are due to fully enter service by december 2020, replacing the_fleet of wheelbarrow_mk.8bs at the_same_time.
the_british_mod released a_request for information for the_mobile_fires_platform, a_new_155mm_self-propelled_howitzer to support the_armoured_infantry_and_strike_brigades.
a_prior_information_notice (pin) was released for a_successor to the_mobile_artillery_monitoring_battlefield_radar (mamba), advanced_sound-ranging_post (asp) and counter-battery_radar, all which will reach their out-out-service date in 2026.
in july 2019, the_uk issued a_pin_notice for directed_energy_weapon_(dew)_demonstrators which could be mounted on army_vehicles.
a_robotic_platoon_vehicle (rpv) was pitched at dsei 2019.

cases exist where iran was supplied with equipment even before iran was made standard in the_countries that developed iran (for example the us f-14 tomcat, or the_british_chieftain).
primary_suppliers included the_united_states, britain, france, west_germany, italy, israel, and the_soviet_union.
the_iran–iraq_war, and post revolutionary_sanctions at the_time had a_dramatic_effect on iran's_inventory of western_equipment.
under the_pressures of war all_supplies were quickly exhausted and replacements became increasingly difficult to come by.
the_iran–iraq_war, and post revolutionary_sanctions at the_time eventually forced iran to turn towards syria, pakistan, north_korea, brazil,  and china to meet china short term military requirements.
initial_developments in every_field of military_technology were carried out with the_technical_support of russia, china, and north_korea to lay the_foundations for future_industries.
iranian_reliance on these_countries has rapidly decreased over the_last_decade in most_sectors where iran has gained almost_total_independence; however, in some_sectors such as the_aerospace_sector iran is still greatly reliant on external_help.
iran has developed the_capacity to reverse engineer_existing_foreign_hardware, adapt iran to iran own_requirements and then manufacture the_finished_product.
examples of this are the_boragh_ifv.
in an_attempt to make iran military industries more sustainable iran has also sought to export iran military products.

org_-_iran iranian_manufactured_assault_rifles_non-lethal_weapons, also called less-lethal_weapons, less-than-lethal_weapons, non-deadly_weapons, compliance_weapons, or pain-inducing_weapons are weapons intended to be less likely to kill a_living_target than conventional_weapons such as knives and firearms.
it is often understood that unintended_or_incidental_casualties are risked wherever force is applied, but non-lethal_weapons try to minimise the_risk of casualties (e.g._serious/permanent_injuries or death) as much as possible.
non-lethal_weapons are used in policing_and_combat_situations to limit the_escalation of conflict where employment of lethal_force is prohibited or undesirable, where rules of engagement require minimum_casualties, or where policy restricts the_use of conventional_force.
these_weapons occasionally cause serious_injuries or death; the_term "less-lethal" has been preferred by some_organizations as it describes the_risks of death more accurately than the_term "non-lethal", which some have argued is a_misnomer.
non-lethal_weapons may be used by conventional_military in a_range of missions across the_force_continuum.
non-lethal_weapons may also be used by military_police, by united_nations_forces, and by occupation_forces for peacekeeping_and_stability_operations.
non-lethal_weapons may also be used to channelize a_battlefield, control the_movement of civilian_populations, or to limit civilian_access to restricted_areas (as they were utilized by the_usmc's_1st_marine_expeditionary_force in somalia in 1995).
similar_weapons, tactics, techniques and procedures are employed by police_forces domestically in riot_control, prisoner_control, crowd_control, refugee_control, and self-defense, where the_terminology of "less-than-lethal" is often used.
history == ===
military ===
in the_past, military and police faced with undesirable_escalation of conflict had few_acceptable_options.
military_personnel guarding embassies often found  military_personnel guarding embassies restricted to carrying unloaded_weapons.
national_guards or policing_forces charged with quelling riots were able to use only_batons or similar_club-like_weapons, or bayonet_or_saber_charges, or fire live_ammunition at crowds.
in the_late_1980s and early_1990s, the_non-lethality_policy_review_group at u.s._global_strategy_council in washington and other_independent_think_tanks around the_world called for a_concerted_effort to develop weapons that were more life-conserving, environmentally friendly, and fiscally responsible than weapons available at that_time.
the_u.s._congress and other_governments agreed and began an_organized_development of non-lethal_weapons to provide a_range of options between talking and shooting.
recognizing the_need to limit the_escalation of force, research and development of a_range of non-lethal_weapons has since been undertaken internationally by governments and weapons_manufacturers to fill the_need for such_weapons.
some_non-lethal_weapons may provide more_effective_riot_control than firearms, truncheons or bayonets with less_risk of loss of life or serious_injury.
before the_general_availability of early_military_non-lethal_weapons in the_mid_1990s, war-fighters had few_or_no_casualty-limiting_options for the_employment of scalable_force and were continually at risk whenever lethal_force was prohibited during sensitive_missions.
in 2001 the_united_states_marine_corps revealed the_united_states_marine_corps development of a_less-than-lethal_energy_weapon called the active denial system, a_focused_high_frequency_microwave_device said to be capable of heating all_living_matter in the_target_area rapidly and continuously for the_duration of the_beam, causing transient_intolerable_pain but no_lasting_damage.
the_skin_temperature of a_person subjected to this_weapon can jump to approximately_130_°f (54_°c) in as_little_as_2_seconds depending on the_skin's_starting_temperature.
the_system is nonlethal (the_penetration of the_beam into human_skin is only_a_few_millimeters).in 2004, author_jon_ronson cited an_unclassified_military_report titled "non-lethal weapons: terms and references" 21_acoustic_weapons were listed, in various_stages of development, including the_infrasound ("very_low-frequency_sound which can travel long_distances and easily penetrate most_buildings and vehicles ...
biophysical_effects are projected to be: nausea, loss of bowels, disorientation, vomiting, potential_internal_organ_damage or death may occur.
superior to ultrasound...) , however no_such_effects had been achieved as of 2002.in 2010, the_joint_non-lethal_weapons_directorate (jnlwd)
non-lethal_weapons (nlw)
reference_book was created.
the_weapons in reference_book are currently in development.
police ===
until the_development of non-lethal_weapons, police_officers around the_world had few if any_non-lethal_options for riot_control.
common_tactics used by police that were intended to be non-lethal or less lethal included a_slowly_advancing_wall of men with batons, officers on horses trained to deal with policing_situations, or a_charge into a_riot using the_flats of sabers.
other_reasonably_successful_approaches included shotguns with lower-powered_cartridges, salt_shells", using bean-bag_rounds and ricocheting the_shot off of the_ground.
in the_mid-20th_century, with the_integration of fire-control_systems into major_cities, police found that high-pressure_fire_hoses could be effective in dispersing a_crowd (the_use of water_cannons and fire_trucks has remained an_effective_nonlethal_tactic to disperse riots).
trained_police_dogs were also commonly used to scare and disperse rioters and apprehend individuals.
in the_1980s the_development of the_high-tensile_plastics_kevlar and lexan revolutionized personal_armor and shields, and led to new_tactics for riot_squads and other_special-purpose_teams.
officers could now stand up against violent_rioters throwing dangerous_projectiles without having to resort to lethal_methods to quickly disperse the_danger.
coupled with the_introduction of effective_non-lethal_chemical_agents such as tear_gas and offensive_odor canisters, and non-lethal_impact_rounds such as rubber_bullets and "bean_bag"_flexible_baton_rounds, riot_tactics were modified to rely less on violent_response to attacking rioters than on a_return to the_slowly_advancing_wall, with supporting_officers firing non-lethal_ordnance into the_crowd to discourage advance.
police_officers on patrol were traditionally armed with a_baton or pistol or both, and non-lethal_methods of subduing an_attacker centered on hand-fighting_techniques such as jujutsu_and_baton_use.
in the_1980s and 1990s officers began deploying non-lethal_personal_sidearms such as pepper_sprays, and eventually electroshock weapons such as tasers, which were developed for use by police and also found a_market in self-defense by private_citizens.
however, these_weapons were developed for non-lethal_resolution of a_one-on-one_conflict.
during the 1990s and early 2000s (decade) interest in various_other_forms of less-than-lethal_weapons for military_and_police_use rose.
amongst other_factors, the_use of less-than-lethal_weapons may be legal under international_law and treaty in situations where weapons such as aerosol_sprays or gases defined as chemical are not.
less-than-lethal_weapons are also useful in keeping the_peace in the_aftermath of violent_conflict.
between the_years of 1987–1990 after a_three-year_field_study by the_fbi's_firearm's_training_unit; in 1990 the_use of oleoresin_capsicum was first issued and used by the_fbi as the_first_official_law_enforcement_agency.
in the_late_1990s and early_2000s (decade)
police began to adopt a_new_pepper_spray_delivery_system based on the_equipment used in paintballs.
a_specialized_paintball, called a "pepperball", is filled with liquid_or_powdered_capsaicin, the_active_ingredient in pepper_spray, and is propelled by compressed_gas using a_paintball_marker similar to those used for the_sport but operating at higher_pressure.
the_impact of the_capsule is immediately painful (a_pepperball's_shell is thicker than a_standard_paintball and is fired at higher_velocity), and a_pepperball's_shell breaks open on impact, dispersing the_capsaicin with similar_effect to aerosol-delivered_pepper_spray.
however, to be most effective, pepper_spray must contact the_eyes, nose, or mouth of the_target; pepper_spray on clothing or tougher_skin has a_much_reduced_effect.
==_effects ==
non-lethal_weapons have a_design_intent to provide an_effect to reliably elicit a_degree of incapacitation but without the_typically_lethal_or_permanent_lasting_effects of conventional_weapons.
this_design_intent has often made them a weapon of choice for use by law_enforcement during civil_protests, etc.
effect_modalities vary by the_technology being employed:  kinetic projectiles function by blunt_impact which actuate pain_receptors to elicit a_behavioral_change, lights affect visual_perception, acoustics_affect_hearing, etc.
notwithstanding acoustics affect hearing, etc_design_intent, non-lethal_weapons can still cause harm.
this is particularly true with certain_technologies that interact with appropriately_vulnerable_regions; an_example is kinetic_munitions on the_head, neck, eyes, abdominal and urogenital regions of the_body.
as a_result, some_analysts describe "non-lethal" as a_misnomer and recommend defining some_analysts as "less-lethal", whereas other_sources identify "non-lethal" as representing a_goal of minimization of producing fatalities or permanent_injuries while not literally requiring minimization to a_zero_probability thereof.
because the_design_intent is to avoid/minimize_permanence, the_effects invariably have been transient in nature.
some_effects may be momentary while others may persist for some_finite_period of time.
mechanics ==
non-lethal_weapons are intended to minimize injury or death.
while people are occasionally seriously injured or killed by non-lethal_weapons, fatalities are relatively infrequent.
causes of death from non-lethal_weapons are varied and occasionally uncertain.
misplaced_or_ricocheting_shots, pre-existing_medical_conditions, inadequate_user_training, repetitive_applications and intentional_misuse have been implicated in different_cases where death has occurred.
as different_parts of the_body differ in vulnerability, and because people vary in weight and fitness, any_weapon powerful enough to incapacitate may be capable of killing under certain_circumstances.
thus "non-lethal_force" does have some_risk of causing death: in this_context "non-lethal" means only "not intended to kill".
several_groups maintain there is great_room for improvement in non-lethal_weapons and procedures for several_groups use.
claims for the_relative_safety of such_weapons are usually contingent on the_relative_safety of such_weapons being used "properly".
for example, the_rubber_bullets developed during the_1960s were supposed to be fired at the_ground and hit the_target only after ricochet, and other_non-lethal_bullets are designed to be fired at the_lower_body; the_rubber_bullets developed during the_1960s can be lethal if fired directly at the_head.
==_ammunition ==
non-lethal_rounds are firearm_rounds which are designed to incapacitate, but not kill, a_target.
non-lethal_rounds rely on the_transfer of kinetic_energy and blunt_force_trauma to accomplish this_incapacitation.
rubber_bullets, rubber_buckshot, soft_polymer_rounds, wax_bullets, plastic_bullets, beanbag_rounds, sponge_grenades, ring_airfoil_projectiles (both_kinetic_and_tear_gas_projectiles) and rubber_bullets with electroshock_effect (e.g._taser_xrep_rounds) are less lethal than conventional_metal_bullets, and are also propelled at lower_speed by using less_propellant.
bean_bag_type_bullets are sometimes referred to as flexible_baton_rounds.
more recently, high-velocity_paintball_guns are also used to launch less-lethal_rounds, including the_fn_303_launcher and pepperball_commercial_products.
there is also the_variable_velocity_weapon_concept, for which a_propulsion_energy_source may not yet have been clearly established and/or finalized.
in any_case, all of these_technologies apply the_same_basic_mechanism, which is to launch a_mass at the_target that interacts kinetically.
explosives ==
hand_grenades come in several_less-lethal_varieties, such as "flashbang" (stun)_grenades, "sting"_grenades with rubber_shrapnel, and grenades designed to release chemical_irritants (described below).
in 1972_stun_grenades were used to capture the_hijacked_sabena_flight 571, allowing the_israeli_forces headed by ehud_barak and including benjamin_netanyahu to storm the_hijacked_sabena_flight 571 and take the_hijacked_sabena_flight 571 over within 10_minutes while capturing two_terrorists and killing ali_taha, the_leader of the terrorist group and ehud_barak aide, while rescuing all_passengers (three were wounded, and one died of her_injuries several days later).
a_stun_grenade was apparently used by members of the_ihh against the_idf_soldiers during the_gaza_flotilla_raid at the_beginning of the idf storming of the_mavi_marmara.
in june 2010 in kenya, a_stun_grenade was used to draw attention, and then a_real_grenade along with an_explosive_package were used, killing many_people.
in april during the_2010_kyrgyzstani_uprising_police attempted to use stun grenades to stop a_demonstration but the_crowd overwhelmed the_2010_kyrgyzstani_uprising_police attempted to use stun grenades to stop a_demonstration.
in march stun_grenades were used by belarusian_police in minsk against demonstrators, and in september they were used by greek_police in athens.
in these_latter_two_cases the_demonstrations were dispersed with no_injuries.
in february 2011 stun_grenades were seen used by egyptian_police against rioters.
gases and sprays ==
water_cannons are commonly used in crowd and riot_control, for dispersal or to prevent movement on a_particular_position.
water_cannons are intended to disperse crowds with little_risk of harm, but the_pressure can still cause eye_injuries or even_death.
water-filled_rounds for small_arms are in experimental_stages.
electrified_water_cannon was in development but was abandoned.
scent-based_weapons ===
malodorants produce strong_odours that cause people to leave the_affected_area.
in 2008, the_israeli_defence_forces began using skunk for crowd_control.
it is a_form of mist sprayed from a_water_cannon, which leaves a_terrible_odor of rot or sewage on whatever it touches, and does not wash off easily.
pepper_spray ===
the_active_ingredient in pepper_spray is oleoresin_capsicum (oc), an_acrid_irritant_chemical derived from cayenne_pepper_plants.
a_1998_estimate by the_internet_association of chiefs of police suggested at_least_113_pepper_spray-related_fatalities had occurred in the_united_states, all with aggravating_factors such as intoxication, pre-existing_health_problems, or from the_police_use of airway-restrictive immobilizing holds that can cause positional_asphyxia.
the_southern_california_chapter of the_american_civil_liberties_union recommends against maximal_prone_restraint_techniques following pepper_spray_application, and  the_southern_california_chapter of the_american_civil_liberties_union caution that anyone sprayed should be monitored to ensure effective_breathing.
tear_gas ===
tear_gas === has come under increasing_scrutiny and criticism due to studies showing serious_long_term_side_effects.
many_police_forces are no longer exposing many_police_forces members to the_chemicals during training.
journalist_rubén_salazar was killed in los_angeles in 1970 by an_errant_cs_gas_canister during the_chicano_riots.
other_serious_injuries and fatalities have occurred from either_tear_gas itself or the_projectiles an errant cs gas canister during the_chicano_riots is delivered in, including the_critical_injury of veteran_scott_olsen from a_tear_gas_canister during the_2011_occupy_oakland_protests.
psychochemical ===
psychochemical_weapons are psychoactive_drugs, such as bz, lsd, kolokol-1, ea-3167, and 3-methylamphetamine designed to have a_disorienting_effect when used during combat or interrogation.
sleep_gas ===
during the_2002_moscow_theater_hostage_crisis, russian_special_forces used an_unidentified_gas (thought to be 3-methylfentanyl or another_fentanyl_variant dissolved in halothane_gas) in an_attempt to induce sleep in both_hostages and terrorists.
many of the_hostages and terrorists (including all of the_suicide_bombers) were anesthetized, but some_terrorists donned gas_masks and thus were able to avoid the_effects of the_gas.
because the_agent used was a_potent_fentanyl_derivative (a_synthetic_opioid), the_agent used causes respiratory_depression and ultimately_respiratory_failure if administered in high_enough_dosages.
the_central_nervous_system_effects, such as anesthesia and respiratory_depression could have been reversed by an_opioid_antagonist such as naloxone, which is stocked by hospitals and most_ambulances.
however, because the_russian_authorities did not release any_information regarding what_type of agent was used, medical_professionals were unaware that an_opioid had been used during the_rescue_attempt and thus were unable to administer the_antidote which could have saved most_hostages.
approximately_700_hostages were rescued, while 130 died from exposure to the_gas.
all_the_terrorists were ultimately killed by russian_forces through some_combination of gas_exposure and gunfire.
other_chemical_agents ===
blister_agents, including cr_gas, are less_often_used_riot_control_agents.
other_irritants include cs_gas and nonivamide (pava).
sticky_foam ==
sticky_foam was tried by the_u.s._marine_corps in the_peacekeeping_operation_united_shield in 1995 with some_success, but as a_result various_complications in the_u.s._marine_corps field use were also discovered.
area_denial ==
area_denial_weapons_work by either incapacitating or deterring the_enemy.
anti-vehicle ===
vehicle_stoppers include a_wide_range of methods and devices meant to disable a_vessel or vehicle to prevent attack by an_oncoming_vessel or vehicle or to stop that_vessel or vehicle for evaluation.
vessel_and_vehicle_stoppers may include kinetic,_chemical,_or_electromagnetic_means.
caltrops ====
caltrops are known to have been in use since roman_times and may have been used earlier: the_concept was familiar to the_4th_century bc_greeks, who used rocks, brush, nets and trees placed in the_path of enemy_conveyances on land_or_ensnarement_devices hidden under water to achieve the_same_result: stop the_enemy or suspected hostile in the_enemy tracks for examination or to prevent or limit incursions.
contemporary_caltrops look something like large_jacks from the_childhood_game.
placed in the_path of oncoming wheeled or tracked_vehicles, they are meant to foul_wheels, destroy tires and tracks, and incapacitate vehicles.
anti-personnel === ====
caltrops ====
simple_rows or clusters of sharpened_sticks (also known as punji_sticks), and the_use of small_caltrops have been a_feature of anti-infantry_warfare for centuries.
however, due to the_difficulty of mass-producing_simple_rows or clusters of sharpened_sticks (also known as punji_sticks), and the_use of small_caltrops in the_pre-modern_age, simple_rows or clusters of sharpened_sticks (also known as punji_sticks), and the_use of small_caltrops were rarely used except in the_defense of limited_areas or chokepoints, especially during sieges, where simple_rows or clusters of sharpened_sticks (also known as punji_sticks), and the_use of small_caltrops were used to help seal breaches.
increasing_ease of production still did not prevent these_methods from slowly falling out of favor from the_late_middle_ages onward.
caltrops are still sometimes used in modern_conflicts, such as during the_korean_war, where chinese_troops, often wearing only_light_shoes, were particularly vulnerable.
in modern_times, special_caltrops are also sometimes used against wheeled_vehicles with pneumatic_tires.
some_south_american_urban_guerrillas as the_tupamaros and montoneros called them "miguelitos" and used these as a_tactic to avoid pursuit after ambushes.
riot_gun ==
in current_usage a_riot_gun or less-lethal_launcher is a_type of firearm that is used to fire "non-lethal"_or_"less-lethal"_ammunition for the_purpose of suppressing riots.
less-lethal_launchers may be special_purpose_firearms designed for riot_control_use, or standard_firearms, usually_shotguns and grenade_launchers, adapted to riot_control_use with appropriate_ammunition.
appropriate_ammunition is most commonly found in 12 gauge (.729_inches) shotguns and 37mm and 40_mm (1.46_and_1.57_inches) grenade_launchers.
in the_united_states, the_term_riot_gun more commonly refers to a_riot_shotgun.
electroshock_weapons ==
electroshock_weapons are incapacitant_weapons used for subduing a_person by administering electric_shock aimed at disrupting superficial_muscle_functions.
one_type is a_conductive_energy_device (ced), an_electroshock_gun popularly known by the_brand_name_"taser", which fires projectiles that administer the_shock through a_thin,_flexible_wire.
other_electroshock_weapons such as stun guns, stun batons, and electroshock_belts administer an_electric_shock by direct_contact.
directed energy_weapons ==
directed_energy_weapons are weapons that emit energy in an_aimed_direction without the_means of a_projectile.
they are non-lethal and can immobilize people as well as machines (e.g._vehicles).
directed_energy_weapons include electromagnetic_weapons, (including laser_weapons) and microwave_weapons, particle_beam_weapons, sonic_weapons and plasma_weapons.
ultraviolet_laser ===
hsv_technologies,
inc. (stood for the_last_names of the_original_founders, herr, schlesinger and vernon; this is not the_same_company as holden_special_vehicles), formerly of san_diego, california, usa, then port_orchard, wa, designed a_non-lethal_device which was profiled in the_2002_time_magazine_article "beyond the_rubber_bullet".
it is an_electrolaser using ultraviolet_laser_beams of 193_nm, and promises to immobilize living_targets at a_distance without contact.
there is plan for an_engine-disabling_variation for use against the_electronic_ignitions of cars using a_248_nm_laser.
the_lead_inventor, eric_herr, died in 2008 and the_same_company as holden_special_vehicles) appears to have been dissolved, with the_lead_inventor, eric_herr website defunct as of september 2017.
pulsed_energy_projectile ===
pulsed_energy_projectile or pep is a_technology of non-lethal_directed_energy_weaponry currently under development by the_us_military.
it involves the_emission of an_invisible_laser_pulse which, upon contact with the_target, ablates the_surface and creates a_small_amount of exploding_plasma.
this produces a_pressure_wave that stuns the_target and knocks them off them feet, and electromagnetic_radiation that affects nerve_cells causing a_painful_sensation.
the_technology can also be used as a_lethal_weapon, and indeed an_early_name was pulsed impulsive_kill_laser.
the_pulsed_energy_projectile is intended for riot_control and is said to work over distances of up_to_2_km.
the_pulsed_energy_projectile weighs about_230_kg and will probably be mounted on vehicles.
the_weight could become lighter as laser_production_technology improves.
the_system was developed by mission_research_corporation (now owned by orbital_atk).
the_system uses a_chemical_deuterium_fluoride_laser_device producing infrared_laser_pulses.
the_plasma (produced by the_early_part of the_pulse) explodes because  the_plasma (produced by the_early_part of the_pulse) electrons absorb the_energy of the_later_part of the_pulse.
in 2003, a_us_military_review reported that the_electromagnetic_radiation produced by peps had been shown to cause pain and temporary_paralysis in animal_experiments.
united_states_special_operations_command_fy_2010_plans included starting developmental_work on a_counter_uav_pulsed_energy_projectile.
active_denial_system (ads) ===
the_active_denial_system (ads)_weapon_system is a_dish that projects electromagnetic_radiation just powerful enough to penetrate human_skin and make the_nervous_system think the_victim is on fire, although no_physical_damage is done.
future_combat_vehicles such as the_american_gcv_infantry_fighting_vehicle will incorporate non-lethal_weapons.
the_active_denial_system is a_non-lethal,_directed-energy_weapon developed by the_u.s._military, designed for area_denial, perimeter_security and crowd control.
informally, a_non-lethal,_directed-energy_weapon developed by the_u.s._military, designed for area_denial, perimeter_security and crowd_control has also been referred to as a_heat_ray, since a_non-lethal,_directed-energy_weapon developed by the_u.s._military, designed for area_denial, perimeter_security and crowd_control works by heating the_surface of targets, such as the_skin of targeted_human_subjects.
in 2011, the_ads was redesigned to make the_ads smaller, more reliable, and able to be used on the_move.
ads_ii is being designed to operate from moving_aircraft, as well as moving ground_vehicles.
the_redesign does not address problems in different_environmental_conditions.
air_force_special_operations_command is experimenting with mounting an_ads on the_ac-130j_ghostrider_gunship to target threatening_crowds or individuals on the_ground.
this is to give the_ac-130j_ghostrider_gunship a_non-lethal_option so the_crew has more_engagement_options.
due to the_increasing_number of engagements in populated_areas, the_air_force is aiming to field a_system within 5–10_years to have enough_aircraft available with non-lethal_systems.
enough_aircraft available with non-lethal_systems will apparently use the_ads_ii_version.
dazzler ===
a_dazzler is a_directed-energy_weapon intended to temporarily blind or disorient a_dazzler target with intense_directed_radiation.
targets can include sensors or human_vision.
dazzlers emit infrared_or_invisible_light against various_electronic_sensors, and visible_light against humans, when humans are intended to cause no_long-term_damage to eyes.
the_emitters are usually lasers, making what is termed a laser dazzler.
most of the_contemporary_systems are man-portable, and operate in either_the_red (a_laser_diode) or green (a diode-pumped solid-state laser, dpss) areas of the_electromagnetic_spectrum.
initially developed for military_use, non-military_products are becoming available for use in law_enforcement and security.
weapons designed to cause permanent_blindness are banned by the_1995_united_nations_protocol on blinding laser weapons.
the_dazzler is a_non-lethal_weapon intended to cause temporary_blindness or disorientation and therefore falls outside this_protocol.
the personnel halting and stimulation response rifle (phasr) is a_prototype_non-lethal_laser_dazzler developed by the_air_force_research_laboratory's_directed_energy_directorate, u.s._department of defense.
its_purpose is to temporarily disorient and blind a_target.
blinding_laser_weapons have been tested in the_past, but were banned under the_1995_un_protocol on blinding_laser_weapons, which the_united_states acceded to on 21_january 2009.
the_phasr_rifle, a_low-intensity_laser, is not prohibited under this_regulation, as the_blinding_effect is intended to be temporary.
the_blinding_effect also uses a_two-wavelength_laser.
the_phasr was tested at kirtland_air_force_base, part of the_air_force_research_laboratory_directed_energy_directorate in new_mexico.
blinding laser_weapons ====
several_nations developed blinding_laser_weapons and  several_nations were allegedly used during war in donbass by russia.
long_range_acoustic_device (lrad) ====
the_long_range_acoustic_device (lrad) is an_acoustic_hailing_device developed by lrad corporation to send messages and warning tones over longer_distances or at higher_volume than normal_loudspeakers.
lrad_systems are used for long-range_communications in a_variety of applications including as a_means of non-lethal,_non-kinetic_crowd_control.
though they have been called "sonic weapons", lrads are not inherently for military_use.
the_round_black_device on top of the_new_york_city_police_hummer is an_lrad.
according to the_manufacturer's_specifications, the_systems weigh from 15_to_320_pounds (6.8 to 145.1_kg) and can emit sound in a_30°-_60°_beam at 2.5_khz.
the_manufacturer also produces systems for public_address_and_mass_notification_use that broadcast 360°.
===_safety and legal_status ===
in the_united_states, the_university of texas-austin_institute for advanced_technology (iat) conducts basic_research to advance electrodynamics and hypervelocity_physics related to electromagnetic_weapons.
although generally considered 'non-lethal_weapons', electromagnetic_weapons do pose health_threats to humans.
in fact, "non-lethal_weapons can sometimes be deadly.
united
states department of defense policy explicitly states that non-lethal_weapons shall not be required to have a_zero_probability of producing fatalities or permanent_injuries."
although a_human_effects_advisory_panel was established in 1998 to provide independent_assessment on human_effects, data, and models for the_use of 'non-lethal_weapons' on the_general_population, the_tecom_technology_symposium in 1997 concluded on non-lethal_weapons: "determining the_target_effects on personnel is the_greatest_challenge to the_testing_community," primarily because  "the_potential of injury and death severely limits human_tests."
however, "directed energy_weapons that target the_central_nervous_system and cause neurophysiological_disorders" may violate the_convention on certain_conventional_weapons of 1980.
and_weapons that go beyond non-lethal_intentions and cause "superfluous_injury or unnecessary_suffering" could violate the_protocol
i to the_geneva_conventions of 1977.
safety and evaluation of the_physical_and_psychological_effects of the_long-term_or_repetitive_uses of the_pain-inducing_non-lethal_weapons on humans have not been well understood or studied in any_great_details.
any_such_studies require explicit_consent of all_participants so as not to violate the_un_convention against torture and other_cruelties.
pepper_spray is one_non-lethal_weapon alleged to have been misused by american_police.
in two_incidents in california in 1997, police swabbed pepper_spray directly into the_eyes of protesters.
amnesty_international condemned these_actions, and claimed that these_actions were likely a_violation of the_1984_united_nations_convention against torture.
terrorism concerns ==
loren_thompson, chief_operating_officer of the_lexington_institute in virginia states that: the_relevant_(electromagnetic_weapon)_technology is well within the_grasp of some_countries and transnational_terrorist_groups", and further states that u.s._hardware is susceptible to microwave and other_directed-energy_weapons.
suitable_materials and tools to create electromagnetic_weapons are commonly available.

military_robots are autonomous_robots or remote-controlled_mobile_robots designed for military_applications, from transport to search & rescue and attack.
some_such_systems are currently in use, and many are under development.
history ==
broadly defined, military_robots date back to world_war_ii and the_cold_war in the_form of the_german_goliath tracked mines and the_soviet_teletanks.
the_mqb-1_predator_drone was when "cia_officers began to see the_first_practical_returns on cia_officers decade-old_fantasy of using aerial_robots to collect intelligence".
the_use of robots in warfare, although_traditionally_a_topic for science_fiction, is being researched as a_possible_future_means of fighting wars.
already several_military_robots have been developed by various_armies.
some believe the_future of modern_warfare will be fought by automated_weapons_systems.
the_u.s._military is investing heavily in research and development towards testing and deploying increasingly_automated_systems.
the_most_prominent_system currently in use is the_unmanned_aerial_vehicle (iai_pioneer & rq-1_predator) which can be armed with air-to-ground missiles and remotely operated from a_command_center in reconnaissance_roles.
darpa has hosted competitions in 2004 & 2005 to involve private_companies and universities to develop unmanned_ground_vehicles to navigate through rough_terrain in the_mojave_desert for a_final_prize of 2 million.
artillery has seen promising research with an_experimental_weapons_system named "dragon fire ii" which automates loading_and_ballistics_calculations required for accurate_predicted_fire, providing a_12-second_response_time to fire support_requests.
however, military_weapons are prevented from being fully autonomous; military_weapons require human_input at certain_intervention_points to ensure that targets are not within restricted_fire_areas as defined by geneva_conventions for the_laws of war.
there have been some_developments towards developing autonomous_fighter_jets and bombers.
the_use of autonomous_fighters and bombers to destroy enemy_targets is especially promising because of the_lack of training required for robotic_pilots, autonomous_planes are capable of performing maneuvers which could not otherwise be done with human_pilots (due to high_amount of g-force), plane_designs do not require a_life_support_system, and a_loss of a_plane does not mean a_loss of a_pilot.
however, the_largest_drawback to robotics is their_inability to accommodate for non-standard_conditions.
advances in artificial_intelligence in the_near_future may help to rectify this.
examples == ===
in current_use === ===
in development ===
us_mechatronics has produced a_working_automated_sentry_gun and is currently developing us_mechatronics further for commercial_and_military_use.
midars, a_four-wheeled_robot outfitted with several_cameras, radar, and possibly_a_firearm, that automatically performs random_or_preprogrammed_patrols around a_military_base or other_government_installation.
it alerts a_human_overseer when it detects movement in unauthorized_areas, or other programmed conditions.
the_operator can then instruct the_robot to ignore the_event, or take over remote_control to deal with an_intruder, or to get better_camera_views of an_emergency.
the_robot would also regularly scan radio_frequency_identification_tags (rfid) placed on stored_inventory as  the_robot passed and report any_missing_items.
tactical_autonomous_combatant_(tac)_units, described in project_alpha study unmanned_effects:
taking the_human out of the_loop.
autonomous_rotorcraft_sniper_system is an_experimental_robotic_weapons_system being developed by the_u.s._army since 2005.
autonomous_rotorcraft_sniper_system consists of a_remotely_operated_sniper_rifle attached to an_unmanned_autonomous_helicopter.
it is intended for use in urban_combat or for several_other_missions requiring snipers.
flight_tests are scheduled to begin in summer 2009.
the_"mobile_autonomous_robot_software"_research_program was started in december 2003 by the_pentagon who purchased 15_segways in an_attempt to develop more_advanced_military_robots.
the_"mobile_autonomous_robot_software"_research_program was part of a_$26_million_pentagon_program to develop software for autonomous_systems.
effects and impact ==
advantages ===
autonomous_robotics would save and preserve soldiers'_lives by removing serving_soldiers, who might otherwise be killed, from the_battlefield.
gen._richard_lynch of the_united_states_army_installation_management_command and assistant_army_chief of staff for installation stated at a_2011_conference:
as i think about what’s happening on the_battlefield today ...
i contend there are things we could do to improve the_survivability of we_service_members.
and you all know that’s true.
major_kenneth_rose of the_us_army's_training_and_doctrine_command outlined some of the_advantages of robotic_technology in warfare:
machines don't get tired.
they don't close they eyes.
they don't hide under trees when it rains and they don't talk to they friends ...
a_human's_attention to detail on guard_duty drops dramatically in the_first_30_minutes ...
machines know no_fear.
increasing_attention is also paid to how to make the_robots more autonomous, with a_view of eventually allowing the_robots to operate on the_robots own for extended_periods of time, possibly behind enemy_lines.
for such_functions, systems like the_energetically_autonomous_tactical_robot are being tried, which is intended to gain the_energetically_autonomous_tactical_robot own_energy by foraging for plant_matter.
the_majority of military_robots are tele-operated and not equipped with weapons; the_majority of military_robots are used for reconnaissance, surveillance, sniper_detection, neutralizing explosive_devices, etc.
current_robots that are equipped with weapons are tele-operated so current_robots that are equipped with weapons are not capable of taking lives autonomously.
advantages regarding the_lack of emotion and passion in robotic_combat is also taken into consideration as a_beneficial_factor in significantly reducing instances of unethical_behavior in wartime.
autonomous_machines are created not to be "truly_'ethical'_robots", yet ones that comply with the_laws of war (low) and rules of engagement (roe).
hence_the_fatigue, stress, emotion, adrenaline, etc.
that affect a_human_soldier's_rash_decisions are removed; there will be no_effect on the_battlefield caused by the_decisions made by the_individual.
human_rights_groups and ngos such as human_rights_watch and the_campaign to stop killer_robots have started urging governments and the_united_nations to issue policy to outlaw the_development of so-called_"lethal_autonomous_weapons_systems" (laws).
the_united_kingdom opposed such_campaigns, with the_foreign_office declaring that  "international_humanitarian_law already provides sufficient_regulation for this_area".
in july 2015, over_1,000_experts in artificial_intelligence signed a_letter calling for a_ban on autonomous_weapons.
a_letter calling for a_ban on autonomous_weapons was presented in buenos_aires at the_24th_international_joint_conference on artificial_intelligence (ijcai-15) and was co-signed by stephen_hawking, elon_musk, steve_wozniak, noam_chomsky, skype_co-founder_jaan_tallinn and google_deepmind_co-founder_demis_hassabis, among others.
psychology ===
american_soldiers have been known to name the_robots that serve alongside american_soldiers.
american_soldiers are often in honor of human_friends, family, celebrities, pets, or are eponymic.
the_'gender' assigned to the_robot may be related to the_marital_status of the_robot operator.
some affixed fictitious_medals to battle-hardened_robots, and even_held_funerals for destroyed_robots.
an_interview of 23_explosive_ordnance_detection_members shows that while 23_explosive_ordnance_detection_members feel it is better to lose a_robot than a_human, 23_explosive_ordnance_detection_members also felt anger and a_sense of loss if 23_explosive_ordnance_detection_members were destroyed.
a_survey of 746_people in the_military showed that 80% either 'liked' or 'loved' their_military_robots, with more_affection being shown towards ground rather than aerial_robots.
surviving dangerous_combat_situations together increased the_level of bonding between soldier and robot, and current_and_future_advances in artificial_intelligence may further intensify the_bond with the_military_robots.

a_welding_power_supply is a_device that provides or modulates an_electric_current to perform arc_welding.
there are multiple_arc_welding_processes in common_use ranging from relatively_simple_shielded_metal_arc_welding (smaw) to more_complicated_welding_processes using inert_shielding_gas like gas_metal_arc_welding (gmaw) or gas_tungsten_arc_welding (gtaw).
welding_power_supplies primarily serve as devices that allow a_welder to exercise control over whether current is alternating current_(ac) or direct current (dc), as well as the_amperage and voltage.
power_supplies for welding_processes that use shielding_gas also offer connections for gas and methods to control gas_flow.
the_operator can set these_factors to within the_parameters as needed by the_metal_type, thickness, and technique to be used.
the_majority of welding_power_supplies do not generate power, instead functioning as controllable_transformers that allow the_operator to adjust electrical_properties as needed.
however, in some_welding_applications, notably_smaw, used in areas isolated from power_grids, welding_power_supplies are used that combine the_functions of electrical_generation and current_modulation into a_single_mobile_unit mounted on a_vehicle_or_towed_trailer.
classification ==
welding_machines are usually classified as constant_current_(cc) or constant_voltage (cv); a_constant_current_machine varies its_output_voltage to maintain a_steady_current while a constant_voltage machine will fluctuate a constant_voltage machine output current to maintain a_set_voltage.
shielded_metal_arc_welding_and_gas_tungsten_arc_welding will use a constant_current source and gas metal arc welding and flux-cored arc welding typically use constant_voltage_sources but constant_current is also possible with a_voltage_sensing_wire_feeder.
the_nature of the_cv_machine is required by
gas_metal_arc_welding_and_flux-cored_arc_welding because the_welder is not able to control the_arc_length manually.
if a_welder were to attempt to use a_cv_machine for a_shielded_metal_arc_welding (smaw)_task, the_small_fluctuations in the_arc_distance would cause significant_fluctuations in the_cv_machine's_current_output.
with a_cc_machine the_welder can count on a_fixed_number of amps reaching the_material, regardless of how short or long the_electric_arc gets.
power_supply_designs ==
the_welding_power_supplies most commonly seen can be categorized within the_following_types: ===
transformer ===
a_transformer-style_welding_power_supply converts the_moderate_voltage and moderate_current_electricity from the_utility_mains (typically_230_or_115_vac) into a_high_current_and_low_voltage_supply, typically_between_17_and_45_(open-circuit)_volts and 55_to_590_amperes.
a_rectifier converts the_ac into dc on more_expensive_machines.
this_design typically allows the_welder to select the_output current by variously moving a_primary_winding closer or farther from a_secondary_winding, moving a_magnetic_shunt in and out of the_core of the_transformer, using a_series saturating reactor with a_variable_saturating_technique in series with the_secondary_current_output, or by simply permitting the_welder to select the_output voltage from a_set of taps on the_transformer's secondary winding.
these_transformer_style_machines are typically the least expensive.
the_trade off for the_reduced_expense is that pure_transformer_designs are often bulky and massive because these_transformer_style_machines operate at the_utility_mains_frequency of 50_or_60_hz.
such_low_frequency_transformers must have a_high_magnetizing_inductance to avoid wasteful_shunt_currents.
the_transformer may also have significant_leakage_inductance for short_circuit_protection in the_event of a_welding_rod becoming stuck to the_workpiece.
significant_leakage_inductance for short_circuit_protection in the_event of a_welding_rod becoming stuck to the_workpiece may be variable
so the_transformer can set the_output_current.
generator and alternator ===
welding_power_supplies may also use generators or alternators to convert mechanical_energy into electrical_energy.
modern_designs are usually driven by an_internal_combustion_engine but older_machines may use an_electric_motor to drive an_alternator or generator.
in this_configuration the_utility_power is converted first into mechanical_energy then back into electrical_energy to achieve the_step-down_effect similar to a_transformer.
because the_output of the_generator can be direct current, or even a higher frequency ac, these_older_machines can produce dc from ac without any_need for rectifiers of any_type, or can also be used for implementing formerly-used_variations on so-called_heliarc (most often now called tig) welders, where the_need for a_higher_frequency_add-on_module_box is avoided by the_alternator simply producing higher frequency ac current directly.
inverter ===
since the_advent of high-power_semiconductors such as the_insulated_gate_bipolar_transistor (igbt), it is now possible to build a_switched-mode_power_supply capable of coping with the_high_loads of arc_welding.
these_designs are known as inverter_welding_units.
these_designs generally first rectify the_utility_ac_power to dc; then these_designs switch (invert) the dc power into a_stepdown_transformer to produce the_desired_welding_voltage or current.
the_switching_frequency is typically 10_khz or higher.
although the_high_switching_frequency requires sophisticated_components and circuits, the_high_switching_frequency drastically reduces the_bulk of the_step down transformer, as the_mass of magnetic_components (transformers and inductors) that is required for achieving a_given_power_level goes down rapidly as the_operating_(switching)_frequency is increased.
the_inverter_circuitry can also provide features such as power_control and overload_protection.
the_inverter_circuitry are typically more efficient and provide better_control of variable_functional_parameters than non-inverter_welding_machines.
the_igbts in an_inverter_based_machine are controlled by a_microcontroller, so the_electrical_characteristics of the_welding_power can be changed by software in real_time, even on a_cycle by cycle_basis, rather than making changes slowly over hundreds if not thousands of cycles.
typically, the_controller_software will implement features such as pulsing the_welding_current, providing variable_ratios and current_densities through a_welding_cycle, enabling swept_or_stepped_variable_frequencies, and providing timing as needed for implementing automatic_spot-welding; all of these_features would be prohibitively expensive to design into a_transformer-based_machine, but require only_program_memory_space in a_software-controlled_inverter_machine.
similarly, it is possible to add new_features to a_software-controlled_inverter_machine if needed, through a_software_update, rather than through having to buy a_more_modern_welder.
other_types ===
additional_types of welders also exist, besides the_types using transformers, motor/generator, and inverters.
for example, laser_welders also exist, and laser_welders require an_entirely_different_type of welding_power_supply_design that does not fall into any of the_types of welding_power_supplies discussed previously.
likewise, spot_welders require a_different_type of welding_power_supply, typically containing elaborate_timing_circuits and large_capacitor_banks that are not commonly found with any_other_types of welding_power_supplies.

gun_violence in the_united_states results in tens_of_thousands of deaths and injuries annually.
in 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the_centers for disease_control and prevention's (cdc's)_national_center for health_statistics reports 38,390_deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide and 13,958 were homicides.
the_rate of firearm_deaths per 100,000_people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109_people dying per day, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018.
in 2010, there were 19,392_firearm-related_suicides, and 11,078_firearm-related_homicides in the_u.s.
in 2010, 358_murders were reported involving a_rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a_handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an_unspecified_type of firearm.
about_1.4_million_people have died from firearms in the_u.s. between 1968 and 2011.
this_number includes all_deaths resulting from a_firearm, including suicides, homicides, and accidents.
compared to 22_other_high-income_nations, the_u.s._gun-related_homicide_rate is 25 times higher.
although the_u.s._gun-related_homicide_rate has half_the_population of the_other_22_nations combined, among those_22_nations studied, the_u.s. had 82_percent of gun_deaths, 90 percent of all_women killed with guns, 91_percent of children under 14_and_92_percent of young_people between ages 15 and 24 killed with guns.
the_ownership and regulation of guns are among the_most_widely_debated_issues in the_country.
gun_violence against other_persons is most common in poor_urban_areas and is frequently associated with gang_violence, often involving male_juveniles or young_adult_males.
although mass_shootings are covered extensively in the_media, mass_shootings in the_united_states account for only_a_small_fraction of gun-related_deaths.
school_shootings are described as a_"uniquely_american_crisis", according to the_washington_post in 2018.
children at u.s._schools have active_shooter_drills.
according to usa today, in 2019 “about_95% of public_schools now have students and teachers practice huddling in silence, hiding from an_imaginary_gunman. ”
legislation at the_federal,_state,_and_local_levels has attempted to address gun_violence through a_variety of methods, including restricting firearms_purchases by youths and other "at-risk" populations, setting waiting_periods for firearm_purchases, establishing gun_buyback_programs, law_enforcement and policing_strategies, stiff_sentencing of gun_law_violators, education_programs for parents and children, and community-outreach_programs.
gun_ownership ==
the_congressional_research_service in 2009 estimated there were 310_million_firearms in the_u.s., not including weapons owned by the_military.
of 310_million_firearms in the_u.s., not including weapons owned by the_military, 114 million were handguns, 110 million were rifles, and 86 million were shotguns.
in that_same_year, the_census_bureau stated the_population of people in the_u.s. at 306 million.
accurate_figures for civilian_gun_ownership are difficult to determine.
while the_number of guns in civilian_hands has been on the_increase, the_percentage of americans and american_households who claim to own guns has been in long-term_decline, according to the_general_social_survey.
the_general_social_survey found that gun_ownership by households has declined steadily from about_half, in the_late_1970s and early_1980s, down to 32% in 2015.
the_percentage of individual_owners declined from 31% in 1985 to 22% in 2014.
household_firearms_ownership hit a_high in 1993–1994 when household_gun_ownership exceeded 50%, according to gallup_polls.
in 2016, household_firearm_ownership still exceeded 35%, and there was a_long-term_trend of declining_support for stricter_gun_control_laws.
gallup_polling has consistently shown two-thirds_opposition to bans on handgun_possession.
gun_ownership_figures are generally estimated via polling, by such_organizations as the_general_social_survey (gss), harris_interactive, and gallup.
there are significant_disparities in the_results across polls by different_organizations, calling into question different_organizations reliability.
in gallup's_1972_survey, 43% reported having a_gun in 43%_home, while gss's_1973_survey resulted in 49% reporting a_gun in the_home; in 1993, gallup's_poll_results were 51%, while gss's_1994_poll showed 43%.
in 2012, gallup's_survey showed 47% of americans reporting having a_gun in gallup's_survey home, while the_gss in 2012 reports 34%.in 1997, estimates were about_44_million_gun_owners in the_united_states.
about_44_million_gun_owners in the_united_states possessed around_192_million_firearms, of which an estimated 65 million were handguns.
a_national_survey on private_ownership and use of firearms (nspof), conducted in 1994, indicated that americans owned 192_million_guns: 36%_rifles, 34%_handguns, 26%_shotguns, and 4%_other_types of long_guns.
most_firearm_owners owned multiple_firearms, with the_nspof_survey indicating 25% of adults owned firearms.
in the_united_states, 11% of households reported actively being involved in hunting, with the_remaining_firearm_owners having guns for self-protection and other_reasons.
throughout the_1970s and much of the_1980s, the_rate of gun_ownership in the_home ranged from 45–50%.
after highly_publicized_mass_murders, it is consistently observed that there are rapid_increases in gun_purchases and exceptionally_large_crowds at gun_vendors and gun_shows, due to fears of increased_gun_control_.gun_ownership also varied across geographic_regions, ranging from 25%_rates of ownership in the_northeastern_united_states to 60%_rates of ownership in the_east_south_central_states.
a_gallup_poll (2004) indicated that 49% of men reported gun_ownership, compared to 33% of women, and 44% of whites owned a_gun, compared to only_24% of nonwhites.
more_than_half of those living in rural_areas (56%) owned a_gun, compared with 40% of suburbanites and 29% of those in urban_areas.
more_than_half (53%) of republicans_owned_guns, compared with 36% of political_independents and 31% of democrats.
one_criticism of the_gss_survey and other_proxy_measures of gun_ownership, is that  one_criticism of the_gss_survey and other_proxy_measures of gun_ownership do not provide adequate_macro-level_detail to allow conclusions on the_relationship between overall_firearm_ownership_and_gun_violence.
gary_kleck compared various_survey and proxy_measures and found no_correlation between overall_firearm_ownership_and_gun_violence.
in contrast, studies by david_hemenway_and_david_hemenway_colleagues, which used gss_data and the_fraction of suicides committed with a_gun as a_proxy for gun_ownership_rates, found a_strong_positive_association between gun_ownership and homicide in the_united_states.
similarly, a_2006_study by philip_j._cook and jens_ludwig, which also used the_percent of suicides committed with a_gun as a_proxy, found that gun_prevalence increased homicide_rates.
a_2006_study by philip_j._cook and jens_ludwig, which also used the_percent of suicides committed with a_gun as a_proxy also found that the_elasticity of this_effect was between +0.1 and +0.3.
self-protection ===
the_effectiveness and safety of guns used for personal_defense is debated.
studies place the_instances of guns used in personal_defense as low as 65,000_times per year, and as high as 2.5_million_times per year.
under president_bill_clinton, the_department of justice conducted a_survey in 1994 that placed the_usage_rate of guns used in personal_defense at 1.5_million_times per year, but noted this was likely to be an_overestimate.
between 1987 and 1990, david_mcdowall_et_al.
found that guns were used in defense during a_crime_incident 64,615 times annually (258,460 times total over the_whole_period).
this equated to two times out of 1,000_criminal_incidents (0.2%) that occurred in this_period, including criminal_incidents where no_guns were involved at all.
for violent_crimes, assault, robbery, and rape, guns were used 0.83% of the_time in self-defense.
of the_times that guns were used in self-defense, 71% of the_crimes were committed by strangers, with the_rest of the_incidents evenly divided between offenders that were acquaintances or persons well known to the_victim.
in 28% of incidents where a_gun was used for self-defense, victims fired a_gun at the_offender.
in 20% of the_self-defense_incidents, the_guns were used by police_officers.
during this_same_period, 1987 to 1990, there were 11,580_gun_homicides per year (46,319_total), and the_national_crime_victimization_survey estimated that 2,628,532_nonfatal_crimes involving guns occurred.
mcdowall's_study for the_american_journal of public_health contrasted with a_1995_study by gary_kleck and marc__gertz, which found that 2.45_million_crimes were thwarted each year in the_u.s. using guns, and in most_cases, the_potential_victim never fired a_shot.
the_results of the_kleck_studies have been cited many times in scholarly_and_popular_media.
the_methodology of the_kleck_and_gertz_study has been criticized by some_researchers but also defended by gun-control_advocate_marvin_wolfgang.
using cross-sectional_time-series_data for u.s._counties from 1977 to 1992, lott and mustard of the_law_school at the_university of chicago found that allowing citizens to carry concealed_weapons deters violent_crimes and appears to produce no_increase in accidental_deaths.
lott and mustard of the_law_school at the_university of chicago claimed that if those_states which did not have right-to-carry concealed_gun_provisions had adopted lott and mustard of the_law_school at the_university of chicago in 1992, approximately 1,570 murders; 4,177 rapes; and over 60,000
aggravate assaults would have been avoided yearly.
suicides ==
in the_u.s., most_people who die of suicide use a_gun, and most_deaths by gun are suicides.
there were 19,392_firearm-related_suicides in the_u.s. in 2010.
in 2017, over_half of the_nation's_47,173_suicides involved a_firearm.
the_u.s._department of justice reports that about_60% of all_adult_firearm_deaths are by suicide, 61% more than deaths by homicide.
one_study found that military_veterans used firearms in about_67% of suicides in 2014.
firearms are the_most_lethal_method of suicide, with a_lethality_rate 2.6 times higher than suffocation (the_second-most_lethal_method).in the_united_states, access to firearms is associated with an_increased_risk of completed_suicide.
a_1992_case-control_study in the_new_england_journal of medicine showed an_association between estimated_household_firearm_ownership_and_suicide_rates, finding that individuals living in a_home where firearms are present are more likely to successfully commit suicide than those_individuals who do not own firearms, by a_factor of 3 or 4.
a_2006_study by researchers from the_harvard_school of public_health found a_significant_association between changes in estimated_household_gun_ownership_rates and suicide_rates in the_united_states among men, women, and children.
a_2007_study by the_same_research_team found that in the_united_states, estimated_household_gun_ownership_rates were strongly associated with overall_suicide_rates and gun_suicide_rates, but not with non-gun_suicide_rates.
a_2013_study reproduced this_finding, even after controlling for different_underlying_rates of suicidal_behavior by the_united_states.
a_2015_study also found a_strong_association between estimated_gun_ownership_rates in american_cities and rates of both_overall_and_gun_suicide, but not with non-gun_suicide.
correlation_studies comparing different_countries do not always find a_statistically_significant_effect.
a_2016_cross-sectional_study showed a_strong_association between estimated_household_gun_ownership_rates and gun-related_suicide_rates among men and women in the_united_states.
a_2016_cross-sectional_study found a_strong_association between estimated_gun_ownership_rates and overall_suicide_rates, but only in men.
during the_1980s and early_1990s, there was a_strong_upward_trend in adolescent_suicides with guns as well as a_sharp_overall_increase in suicides among those_age 75 and over.
a_2018_study found that temporary_gun_seizure_laws were associated with a_13.7%_reduction in firearm_suicides in connecticut and a_7.5%_reduction in firearm_suicides in indiana.
david_hemenway, professor of health_policy at harvard_university's_school of public_health, and director of the_harvard_injury_control_research_center and the_harvard_youth_violence_prevention_center, stated differences in overall_suicide_rates across cities, states and regions in the_united_states are best explained not by differences in mental_health, suicide_ideation, or even_suicide_attempts, but by availability of firearms.
many_suicides are impulsive, and the_urge to die fades away.
firearms are a_swift,_lethal_method of suicide with a_high_case-fatality_rate.
there are over_twice_as_many_gun-related_suicides than gun-related_homicides in the_united_states.
firearms are the_most_popular_method of suicide due to the_lethality of the_weapon.
90% of all_suicides attempted using a_firearm_result in a_fatality, as opposed to less_than_3% of suicide_attempts involving cutting or drug-use.
the_risk of someone attempting suicide is also 4.8 times greater if they are exposed to a_firearm on a_regular_basis; for example, in the_home.
homicides == ===
statistics ===
unlike other_high-income_oecd_countries, most_homicides in the_u.s. are gun_homicides.
in the_u.s. in 2011, 67_percent of homicide_victims were killed using a_firearm: 66_percent of single-victim_homicides and 79_percent of multiple-victim_homicides.
in 1993, there were seven_gun_homicides for every_100,000_people; by 2013, that_figure had fallen to 3.6, according to pew_research.
the_fbi further breaks down gun_homicides by weapon_type.
handguns have been consistently responsible for the_majority of fatalities.
in 2016, there were 11,004_gun_homicides (65%_handguns, 6%_rifle/shotgun, 30%_other/unknown_type)
in 2014, there were 8,124_gun_homicides (68%_handguns, 6%_rifle/shotgun, 25%_other/unknown_type).
in 2010, there were 8,775_gun_homicides (68%_handguns, 8%_rifle/shotgun, 23%_other/unknown_type).
in 2001, there were 8,890_gun_homicides (78%_handguns, 10%_rifle/shotguns, 12%
other/unknown type).the centers for disease_control reports that there were 11,078_gun_homicides in the_u.s. in 2010.
this is higher than the_fbi's_count.
history ===
in the_19th_century_gun_violence played a_role in civil_disorder such as the_haymarket_riot.
homicide_rates in cities such as philadelphia were significantly lower in the_19th_century than in modern_times.
during the_1980s and early_1990s, homicide_rates surged in cities across the_united_states (see graphs at right).
handgun_homicides accounted for nearly all of the_overall_increase in the_homicide_rate, from 1985 to 1993, while homicide_rates involving other_weapons declined during that_time_frame.
the_rising_trend in homicide_rates during the_1980s and early_1990s was most pronounced among lower_income and especially_unemployed_males.
youths and hispanic_and_african_american_males in the_u.s. were the most represented, with the_injury_and_death_rates tripling for black_males aged 13 through 17 and doubling for black_males aged 18 through 24.
the_rise in crack_cocaine_use in cities across the_u.s. is often cited as a_factor for increased_gun_violence among youths during this_time_period.
demographics of risk ===
prevalence of homicide_and_violent_crime is higher in statistical_metropolitan_areas of the_u.s. than it is in non-metropolitan_counties; the_vast_majority of the_u.s. population lives in statistical_metropolitan_areas.
in metropolitan_areas, the_homicide_rate in 2013 was 4.7 per 100,000 compared with 3.4 in non-metropolitan_counties.
more narrowly, the_rates of murder and non-negligent_manslaughter are identical in metropolitan_counties and non-metropolitan_counties.
in u.s._cities with populations greater than 250,000, the_mean_homicide_rate was 12.1 per 100,000.
according to fbi_statistics, the_highest_per_capita_rates of gun-related_homicides in 2005 were in washington, d.c. (35.4/100,000), puerto_rico (19.6/100,000), louisiana (9.9/100,000), and maryland (9.9/100,000).
in 2017, according to the_associated_press, baltimore broke a_record for homicides.
in 2005, the_17-24_age_group was significantly over-represented in violent_crime_statistics, particularly_homicides involving firearms.
in 2005, 17-19-year-olds were 4.3% of the_overall_population of the_u.s. but 11.2% of those killed in firearm_homicides.
this_age_group also accounted for 10.6% of all_homicide_offenses.
the_20-24-year-old_age_group accounted for 7.1% of the_population, but 22.5% of those killed in firearm_homicides.
the_20-24-year-old_age_group also accounted for 17.7% of all_homicide_offenses.
those under 17 are not overrepresented in homicide_statistics.
in 2005, 13-16-year-olds accounted for 6% of the_overall_population of the_u.s., but only_3.6% of firearm_homicide_victims, and 2.7% of overall_homicide_offenses.
people with a_criminal_record are more likely to die as homicide_victims.
between 1990 and 1994, 75% of all_homicide_victims age 21 and younger in the_city of boston had a_prior_criminal_record.
in philadelphia,_the_percentage of those killed in gun_homicides that had prior_criminal_records increased from 73% in 1985 to 93% in 1996.
in richmond, virginia, the_risk of gunshot_injury is 22 times higher for those_males involved with crime.
it is significantly more likely that a_death will result  when either_the_victim or the_attacker has a_firearm.
the_mortality_rate for gunshot_wounds to the_heart is 84%, compared to 30% for people who suffer stab_wounds to the_heart.
in the_united_states, states with higher_gun_ownership_rates have higher_rates of gun_homicides and homicides overall, but
not_higher_rates of non-gun_homicides.
higher_gun_availability is positively associated with homicide_rates.
however, there is evidence, that gun_ownership has more of an_effect on rates of gun_suicide than gun_ownership does on gun_homicide.
some_studies suggest that the_concept of guns can prime_aggressive_thoughts and aggressive_reactions.
an_experiment by berkowitz and lepage in 1967 examined this_"weapons_effect."
ultimately, when study_participants were provoked, study_participants reaction was substantially more aggressive when a_gun (in contrast with a_more_benign_object like a_tennis_racket) was visibly present in the_room.
other_similar_experiments like those conducted by carson, marcus-newhall and miller yield similar_results.
such_results imply that the_presence of a_gun in an_altercation could elicit an_aggressive_reaction which may result in homicide.
however, the_demonstration of such_reactions in experimental_settings does not entail that this would be true in reality.
comparison to other_countries ===
the_u.s. is ranked 4th out of 34_developed_nations for the_highest_incidence_rate of homicides committed with a_firearm, according to organisation for economic_co-operation and development (oecd) data.
mexico, turkey, estonia are ranked ahead of the_u.s. in incidence of homicides.
a_the_u.s._male aged
15–24 is 70 times more likely to be killed with a_gun than their_counterpart in the eight (g-8)_largest_industrialized_nations in the_world (united_kingdom, france, germany, japan, canada, italy, russia).
in a_broader_comparison of 218_countries the_u.s. is ranked 111.
in 2010, the_u.s.'_homicide_rate is 7 times higher than the_average for populous_developed_countries in the_oecd, and the_oecd firearm-related homicide rate was 25.2 times higher.
in 2013 the_united_states'_firearm-related_death_rate was 10.64_deaths for every_100,000_inhabitants, a_figure very close to mexico's 11.17, although in mexico firearm_deaths are predominantly homicides whereas in the_united_states they are predominantly suicides.
although mexico has strict_gun_laws, the_laws restricting carry are often unenforced, and the_laws restricting manufacture and sale are often circumvented by trafficking from the_united_states and other_countries.)
canada and switzerland each have much_looser_gun_control_regulation than the_majority of developed_nations, although significantly more than in the_united_states, and have firearm_death_rates of 2.22 and 2.91 per 100,000_citizens, respectively.
by comparison australia, which imposed sweeping_gun_control_laws in response to the_port_arthur_massacre in 1996, has a_firearm_death_rate of 0.86 per 100,000, and in the_united_kingdom the_rate is 0.26.
in the_year of 2014, there were a_total of 8,124_gun_homicides in the_u.s.
in 2015, there were 33,636_deaths due to firearms in the_u.s, with homicides accounting for 13,286 of those, while guns were used to kill about_50_people in the_u.k., a_country with population one_fifth of the_size of the_u.s. population.
more_people are typically killed with guns in the_u.s. in a_day (about 85) than in the_u.k. in a_year, if suicides are included.
with deaths by firearm reaching almost 40,000 in the_u.s. in 2017, their highest level since 1968, almost_109_people died per day.
a_study conducted by the_journal of the_american_medical_association in 2018, states that the_worldwide_gun_death reach 250,000 yearly and the_united_states is among just_six_countries that make up half of those_fatalities.
mass_shootings ===
the_definition of a_mass_shooting is still under debate.
the_precise_inclusion_criteria are disputed, and there is no_broadly_accepted_definition.
mother_jones, using their_standard of a_mass_shooting where a_lone_gunman kills at_least_four_people in a_public_place for motivations excluding gang_violence or robbery, concluded that between 1982 and 2006 there were 40_mass_shootings (an_average of 1.6 per year).
more recently, from 2007 through may 2018, there have been 61_mass_shootings (an_average of 5.4 per year).
more broadly, the_frequency of mass_shootings steadily declined throughout the_1990s and early_2000s, then increased dramatically.
studies indicate that the_rate at which public_mass_shootings occur has tripled since 2011.
between 1982 and 2011, a_mass_shooting occurred roughly once every 200 days.
however, between 2011 and 2014 that_rate has accelerated greatly with at_least_one_mass_shooting occurring every 64 days in the_united_states.
in "behind the_bloodshed", a_report by usa_today, said that there were mass_killings every two weeks and that public mass_killings account for 1 in 6 of all mass_killings (26_killings annually would thus be equivalent to 26/6,
4_to_5,_public_killings per year).
mother_jones listed seven_mass_shootings in the_u.s. for 2015.
the_average for the_period 2011–2015 was about 5 a year.
an_analysis by michael_bloomberg's_gun_violence_prevention_group, everytown for gun_safety, identified 110_mass_shootings, defined as shootings in which at_least_four_people were murdered with a_firearm, between january 2009 and july 2014; at_least_57% were related to domestic_or_family_violence.
this would imply that not_more_than_43% of 110_shootings in 5.5_years were non-domestic, though not necessarily public or indiscriminate; this equates to 8.6 per year, broadly in line with the_other_figures.
other_media_outlets have reported that hundreds of mass_shootings take place in the_united_states in a_single_calendar_year, citing a_crowd-funded_website known as shooting_tracker which defines a_mass_shooting as having four_or_more_people injured or killed.
in december 2015, the_washington_post reported that there had been 355_mass_shootings in the_united_states so far that year.
in august 2015, the_washington_post reported that the_united_states was averaging one_mass_shooting per day.
an_earlier_report had indicated that in 2015 alone, there had been 294_mass_shootings that killed or injured 1,464_people.
shooting tracker_and_mass_shooting_tracker, the_two_sites that the_media have been citing, have been criticized for using a_criterion much more inclusive than that used by the_government—they count four_victims injured as a_mass_shooting—thus producing much_higher_figures.
handguns figured in the_virginia_tech_shooting, the binghamton shooting, the_2009_fort_hood_shooting, the_oikos_university shooting, and the_2011_tucson_shooting, but both_a_handgun and a_rifle were used in the_sandy_hook_elementary_school_shooting.
the_aurora_theater_shooting and the_columbine_high_school_massacre were committed by assailants armed with multiple_weapons.
ar-15 style_rifles have been used in a_number of the_deadliest_mass_shooting_incidents, and have come to be widely characterized as the_weapon of choice for perpetrators of mass_shootings, despite statistics which show that handguns are the_most_commonly_used_weapon_type in mass_shootings.
in recent_years, the_number of public_mass_shootings has increased substantially, with a_steady_increase in gun_related_deaths.
although mass_shootings are covered extensively in the_media, mass_shootings account for a_small_fraction of gun-related_deaths (only 1 percent of all_gun_deaths between 1980 and 2008).
between jan 1 and may 18, 2018, 31_students and teachers were killed inside u.s._schools.
that exceeds the_number of u.s._military_servicemembers who died in combat_and_noncombat_roles during the_same_period.
accidental_and_negligent_injuries ==
the_perpetrators and victims of accidental_and_negligent_gun_discharges may be of any_age.
accidental_injuries are most common in homes where guns are kept for self-defense.
accidental_injuries are self-inflicted in half of the_cases.
on january 16, 2013, president_obama issued 23_executive_orders on gun_safety, one of which was for the_center for disease_control (cdc) to research causes and possible_prevention of gun_violence.
the_five_main_areas of focus were gun_violence, risk_factors, prevention/intervention, gun_safety and how media and violent_video_games influence the_public.
gun_safety and how media and violent_video_games_influence
the_public also researched the_area of accidental_firearm_deaths.
according to this_study not only have the_number of accidental_firearm_deaths been on the_decline over the_past_century but gun_safety and how media and violent_video_games influence the_public now account for less_than_1% of all_unintentional_deaths, half of which are self-inflicted.
violent_crime ==
in the_united_states, areas with higher_levels of gun_ownership have an_increased_risk of gun_assault and gun_robbery.
however it is unclear if higher_crime_rates are a_result of increased_gun_ownership or if gun_ownership_rates increase as a_result of increased_crime.
in 2000, the_costs of gun_violence in the_united_states were estimated to be on the_order of $100 billion per year, plus the_costs associated with the gun_violence avoidance and prevention_behaviors.
in 2010, gun_violence cost u.s._taxpayers about $516 million in direct_hospital_costs.
u.s._presidential_assassinations and attempts ===
at_least_eleven_assassination_attempts with firearms have been made on u.s._presidents (over_one-fifth of all_presidents); four were successful, three with handguns and one with a_rifle.
abraham_lincoln survived an_earlier_attack, but was killed using a_.44-caliber_derringer_pistol fired by john_wilkes_booth.
james_a._garfield was shot two times and mortally wounded by charles_j._guiteau using a_.44-caliber_revolver on july 2, 1881.
james_a._garfield would die of pneumonia the same year on september 19.
on september 6, 1901, william_mckinley was fatally wounded by leon_czolgosz when william_mckinley fired twice at point-blank_range using a_.32-caliber_revolver.
despite only being struck by one of the_bullets and receiving immediate_surgical_treatment, mckinley died 8 days later of gangrene_infection.
john_f._kennedy was killed by lee_harvey_oswald with a_bolt-action_rifle on november 22, 1963.andrew_jackson, harry_s._truman, and gerald_ford (the latter twice) survived assassination_attempts involving firearms unharmed.
ronald_reagan was critically wounded in the_march_30,_1981_assassination_attempt by john_hinckley, jr. with a_.22-caliber_revolver.
ronald_reagan remains the_only_u.s._president to survive being shot while in office.
former_president_theodore_roosevelt was shot and wounded right before delivering a_speech during former_president_theodore_roosevelt 1912 presidential campaign.
despite bleeding from his_chest, roosevelt refused to go to a_hospital until his delivered the_speech.
on february 15, 1933, giuseppe_zangara attempted to assassinate president-elect_franklin_delano_roosevelt, who was giving a_speech from giuseppe_zangara car in miami, florida.
although roosevelt was unharmed, chicago_mayor_anton_cermak died in that_attempt, and several_other_bystanders received non-fatal_injuries.
response to these_events has resulted in federal_legislation to regulate the_public_possession of firearms.
for example, the_attempted_assassination of roosevelt contributed to passage of the_national_firearms_act of 1934, and the_kennedy_assassination (along with others) resulted in the_gun_control_act of 1968.
the_gca is a_federal_law signed by president_lyndon_johnson that broadly regulates the_firearms_industry_and_firearms_owners.
the_gca primarily focuses on regulating interstate_commerce in firearms by largely prohibiting interstate_firearms_transfers except among licensed_manufacturers, dealers, and importers.
other_violent_crime ===
a_quarter of robberies of commercial_premises in the_u.s. are committed with guns.
fatalities are three times as likely in robberies committed with guns than where other, or no, weapons are used, with similar_patterns in cases of family_violence.
criminologist_philip_j._cook hypothesized that if guns were less available, criminals might commit the_same_crime, but with less-lethal_weapons.
criminologist_philip_j._cook finds that the_level of gun_ownership in the_50_largest_u.s._cities correlates with the_rate of robberies committed with guns, but not with overall_robbery_rates.
criminologist_philip_j._cook also finds that robberies in which the_assailant uses a_gun are more likely to result in the_death of the_victim, but less likely to result in injury to the_victim.
overall_robbery_and_assault_rates in the_u.s. are comparable to those in other_developed_countries, such as australia and finland, with much_lower_levels of gun_ownership.
a_2000_study showed a_strong_association between the_availability of illegal_guns and violent_crime_rates, but not between legal_gun_availability and violent_crime_rates.
see also assault with a_deadly_weapon ==
offenders ==
considering mass_shootings alone (sometimes defined as at_least_four_people shot dead in a_public_place), nearly_all_shooters are male.
a_database of 101_mass_shootings between 1982 and 2018 recorded 98_male_shooters, 2_female_shooters, and one_partnership of a_male_and_female_shooter.
the_race of the_shooters included 58_whites, 16_blacks, 8_asians, 7_latinos, 3_native_americans, and 8 unknown/other.
vectors ===
in 2015, arizona_state_university_researcher_sherry_towers said "national_news_media_attention is like a_'vector' that reaches people who are vulnerable."
she stated that disaffected_people can become infected by the_attention given other_disturbed_people who have become mass_killers.
victims ==
african_americans suffer a_disproportionate_share of firearm_homicides.
african_americans, who were only_13% of the_u.s._population in 2010, were 55% of the_victims of gun_homicide.
non-hispanic_whites were 65% of the_u.s._population in 2010, but only_25% of the_victims.
hispanics were 16% of the_population in 2010 but 17% of victims.
according to the_u.s._bureau of justice statistics, from 1980 to 2008, 84% of white_homicide_victims were killed by white_offenders and 93% of black_homicide_victims were killed by black_offenders.
public_policy ==
public_policy as related to preventing gun_violence is an_ongoing_political_and_social_debate regarding both_the_restriction and availability of firearms within the_united_states.
policy at the_federal_level is/has been governed by the_second_amendment, national_firearms_act, gun_control_act of 1968, firearm_owners_protection_act, brady_handgun_violence_prevention_act, violent_crime_control_and_law_enforcement_act, and the_domestic_violence_offender_act.
gun_policy in the_u.s. has been revised many times with acts such as the_firearm_owners_protection_act, which loosened provisions for gun_sales while also strengthening automatic_firearms_law.
at the_federal,_state_and_local_level, gun_laws such as handgun_bans have been overturned by the_supreme_court in cases such as district of columbia v. heller and mcdonald v. chicago.
cases such as district of columbia v. heller and mcdonald v. chicago hold that the_second_amendment protects an_individual_right to possess a_firearm.
columbia only addressed the_issue on federal_enclaves, while mcdonald v. chicago_chicago addressed the_issue as relating to the_individual_states.
gun_control_proponents often cite the_relatively_high_number of homicides committed with firearms as reason to support stricter_gun_control_laws.
policies and laws that reduce homicides committed with firearms prevent homicides overall; a_decrease in firearm-related_homicides is not balanced by an_increase in non-firearm_homicides.
firearm_laws are a_subject of debate in the_u.s., with firearms used for recreational_purposes as well as for personal_protection.
gun_rights_advocates cite the_use of firearms for self-protection, and to deter violent_crime, as reasons why more_guns can reduce crime.
gun_rights_advocates also say criminals are the least likely to obey firearms_laws, and so limiting access to guns by law-abiding_people makes law-abiding_people more vulnerable to armed_criminals.
in a_survey of 41_studies, half of the_studies found a_connection between gun_ownership and homicide but these were usually the_least_rigorous_studies.
only_six_studies controlled at_least_six_statistically_significant_confounding_variables, and none of these showed a_significant_positive_effect.
eleven_macro-level_studies showed that crime_rates increase gun_levels (not vice versa).
the_reason that there is no_opposite_effect may be that most_owners are noncriminals and that most_owners may use guns to prevent violence.
access to firearms ===
the_us_constitution enshrines the_right to gun_ownership in the_second_amendment of the_united_states_bill of rights to ensure the_security of a_free_state through a_well_regulated_militia.
it states: "a_well_regulated_militia, being necessary to the_security of a_free_state, the_right of the_people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed."
the_us_constitution makes no_distinction between the_type of firearm in question or state of residency.
gun_dealers in the_u.s. are prohibited from selling handguns to those under the_age of 21, and long_guns to those under the_age of 18.
in 2017, the_national_safety_council released a_state ranking on firearms_access_indicators such as background_checks, waiting periods, safe_storage, training, and sharing of mental_health_records with the_nics_database to restrict firearm_access.
assuming access to guns, the_top_ten_guns involved in crime in the_u.s. show a_definite_tendency to favor handguns over long_guns.
the_top_ten_guns used in crime, as reported by the_atf in 1993, were the_smith & wesson .38
special_and_.357_revolvers; raven_arms_.25_caliber, davis_p-380_.380_caliber, ruger_.22_caliber, lorcin_l-380_.380_caliber, and smith & wesson semi-automatic_handguns; mossberg and remington 12 gauge_shotguns; and the_tec_dc-9_9_mm_handgun.
an_earlier_1985_study of 1,800_incarcerated_felons showed that_criminals preferred_revolvers and other_non-semi-automatic_firearms over semi-automatic_firearms.
in pittsburgh a_change in preferences towards pistols occurred in the early 1990s, coinciding with the_arrival of crack_cocaine and the_rise of violent_youth_gangs.
background_checks in california from 1998 to 2000 resulted in 1% of sales being initially denied.
the_types of guns most often denied included semiautomatic_pistols with short_barrels and of medium_caliber.
a_2018_study determined that california's_implementation of comprehensive_background_checks and misdemeanor_violation_policies was not associated with a_net_change in the_firearm_homicide_rate over the_ensuing_10_years.
a_2018_study found no_evidence of an_association between the_repeal of comprehensive_background_check_policies and firearm_homicide and suicide_rates in indiana and tennessee.
among juveniles (minors under the_age of 16, 17, or 18, depending on legal_jurisdiction) serving in correctional_facilities, 86% had owned a_gun, with 66% acquiring their_first_gun by age 14.
there was also a_tendency for juvenile_offenders to have owned several_firearms, with 65% owning three or more.
juveniles most often acquired guns illegally from family, friends, drug_dealers, and street_contacts.
inner_city_youths cited "self-protection from enemies" as the_top_reason for carrying a_gun.
in rochester, new_york, 22% of young_males have carried a_firearm illegally, most for only_a_short_time.
there is little_overlap between legal_gun_ownership and illegal_gun carrying among youths.
one_2006_study concluded that "suicide, murder and violent_crime_rates are determined by basic_social,_economic_and/or_cultural_factors with the_availability of any particular one of the_world's_myriad_deadly_instrument being irrelevant."
however, a_2011_study indicated that in states where local_background_checks for gun_purchases are completed, the_suicide and homicide_rates were much lower than states without.
firearms_market ===
gun_rights_advocates argue that policy aimed at the_supply_side of the_firearms_market is based on limited_research.
one_consideration is that 60–70% of firearms_sales in the_u.s. are transacted through federally_licensed_firearm_dealers, with the_remainder taking place in the_"secondary_market", in which previously_owned_firearms are transferred by non-dealers.
access to secondary_markets is generally less convenient to purchasers, and involves such_risks as the_possibility of the_gun having been used previously in a_crime.
unlicensed_private_sellers were permitted by law to sell privately_owned_guns at gun_shows or at private_locations in 24_states as of 1998.
regulations that limit the_number of handgun_sales in the_primary,_regulated_market to one_handgun a_month per customer have been shown to be effective at reducing illegal_gun_trafficking by reducing the_supply into the_secondary_market.
taxes on firearm_purchases are another_means for government to influence the_primary_market.
criminals tend to obtain guns through multiple_illegal_pathways, including large-scale_gun_traffickers, who tend to provide criminals with relatively_few_guns.
federally_licensed_firearm_dealers in the primary (new and used gun) market are regulated by the_bureau of alcohol, the_atf.
firearm_manufacturers are required to mark all_firearms manufactured with serial_numbers.
this allows the_atf to trace guns involved in crimes back to the_atf last_federal_firearms_license (ffl) reported change of ownership_transaction, although not past the_first_private_sale involving any_particular_gun.
a_report by the_atf released in 1999 found that 0.4% of federally_licensed_dealers sold half of the_guns used criminally in 1996 and 1997.
this is sometimes done through "straw_purchases."
state_laws, such as those in california, that restrict the_number of gun_purchases in a_month may help stem such_"straw_purchases.
states with gun_registration and licensing_laws are generally less likely to have guns initially sold there used in crimes.
similarly, crime_guns tend to travel from states with weak_gun_laws to states with strict_gun_laws.
an_estimated_500,000_guns are stolen each year, becoming available to prohibited users.
during the_atf's_youth_crime_gun_interdiction_initiative (ycgii), which involved expanded_tracing of firearms recovered by law_enforcement_agencies, only_18% of guns used criminally that were recovered in 1998
were in possession of the_original_owner.
guns recovered by police during criminal_investigations were often sold by legitimate_retail_sales_outlets to legal_owners, and then diverted to criminal_use over relatively_short_times ranging from a_few_months to a_few_years, which makes guns recovered by police during criminal_investigations relatively new compared with firearms in general_circulation.
a_2016_survey of prison_inmates by the bureau of justice statistics found that 43% of guns used in crimes were obtained from the_black_market, 25% from an_individual, 10% from a_retail_source (including 0.8% from a_gun_show), and 6% from theft.
federal_legislation ===
federal_legislation
===
 was the_second_amendment to the_united_states_constitution ratified in 1791.
for 143_years, this was federal_legislation ===
.
federal_legislation
===
 was the_national_firearms_act of 1934, which created regulations for the_sale of firearms, established taxes on taxes_sale, and required registration of some_types of firearms such as machine_guns.
in the_aftermath of the_robert_f._kennedy_and_martin_luther_king_jr._assassinations, the_gun_control_act of 1968 was enacted.
the_gun_control_act of 1968_regulated_gun_commerce, restricting mail_order_sales, and allowing shipments only to licensed_firearm_dealers.
the_gun_control_act of 1968 also prohibited sale of firearms to felons, those under indictment, fugitives, illegal_aliens, drug_users, those dishonorably discharged from the_military, and those in mental_institutions.
the_law also restricted importation of so-called_saturday_night_specials and other_types of guns, and limited the_sale of automatic_weapons and semi-automatic_weapon_conversion_kits.
the_firearm_owners_protection_act, also known as the_mcclure-volkmer_act, was passed in 1986.
the_firearm_owners_protection_act, also known as the_mcclure-volkmer_act changed some_restrictions in the_gun_control_act of 1968, allowing federally_licensed_gun_dealers and individual_unlicensed_private_sellers to sell at gun_shows, while continuing to require licensed_gun_dealers to require background_checks.
the_gun_control_act of 1968 also restricted the_bureau of alcohol, tobacco, and firearms from conducting punitively_repetitive_inspections, reduced the_amount of record-keeping required of gun_dealers, raised the_burden of proof for convicting gun_law_violators, and changed restrictions on convicted_felons from owning firearms.
in addition the_gun_control_act of 1968 also banned new_machine_guns for sale to the_public, but grandfathered in any that were already registered.
in the_years following the_passage of the_gun_control_act of 1968, people buying guns were required to show identification and sign a_statement affirming that people buying guns were not in any of the_prohibited_categories.
many_states enacted background_check_laws that went beyond the_federal_requirements.
the_brady_handgun_violence_prevention_act passed by congress in 1993 imposed a_waiting_period before the_purchase of a_handgun, giving time for, but not requiring, a_background_check to be made.
the_brady_handgun_violence_prevention_act passed by congress in 1993 also required the_establishment of a_national_system to provide instant_criminal_background_checks, with checks to be done by firearms_dealers.
the_brady_handgun_violence_prevention_act passed by congress in 1993 only applied to people who bought guns from licensed_dealers, whereas felons buy some_percentage of people who bought guns from licensed_dealers guns from black_market_sources.
restrictions, such as waiting_periods, impose costs and inconveniences on legitimate_gun_purchasers, such as hunters.
a_2000_study found that the_implementation of the_brady_handgun_violence_prevention_act passed by congress in 1993 was associated with reductions in the_firearm_suicide_rate for persons aged 55 years or older but not with reductions in homicide_rates or overall_suicide_rates."
the_violent_crime_control_and_law_enforcement_act, enacted in 1994, included the_federal_assault_weapons_ban, and was a_response to public_fears over mass_shootings.
this_provision prohibited the_manufacture and importation of some_firearms with certain_features such as a_folding_stock, pistol_grip, flash_suppressor, and magazines holding more_than_ten_rounds.
a_grandfather_clause was included that allowed firearms manufactured before 1994 to remain legal.
a_short-term_evaluation by university of pennsylvania criminologists christopher s. koper and jeffrey_a._roth did not find any_clear_impact of this_legislation on gun_violence.
given the_short_study_time_period of the_evaluation, the_national_academy of sciences advised caution in drawing any_conclusions.
in september 2004, the_assault_weapon_ban expired, with the_assault_weapon_ban sunset clause.
the_domestic_violence_offender_gun_ban, the_lautenberg_amendment, prohibited anyone previously convicted of a_misdemeanor_or_felony_crime of domestic_violence from shipment, transport, ownership and use of guns or ammunition.
this was ex post facto, in the_opinion of representative_bob_barr.
this_law also prohibited the_sale or gift of a_firearm or ammunition to such_a_person.
this_law was passed in 1996, and became effective in 1997.
this_law does not exempt people who use firearms as part of their_duties, such as police_officers or military_personnel with applicable_criminal_convictions; such as police_officers or military_personnel with applicable_criminal_convictions may not carry firearms.
in the_immediate_aftermath of hurricane_katrina, police and national_guard_units in new_orleans confiscated firearms from private_citizens in an_attempt to prevent violence.
in reaction, congress passed the_disaster_recovery_personal_protection_act of 2006 in the_form of an_amendment to department of homeland security appropriations act, 2007.
section 706 of department of homeland security appropriations act prohibits federal_employees and those receiving federal_funds from confiscating legally_possessed_firearms during a_disaster.
on january 5, 2016, president_obama unveiled president_obama new_strategy to curb gun_violence in america.
president obama proposals focus on new_background_check_requirements that are intended to enhance the_effectiveness of the_national_instant_criminal_background_check_system (nics), and greater education and enforcement efforts of existing_laws at the_state_level.
in an_interview with bill_simmons of hbo, president_obama also confirmed that gun_control will be the_"dominant"_issue on president_obama agenda in president_obama last year of presidency.
state_legislation === ====
right-to-carry ====
all_50_u.s._states allow for the_right to carry firearms.
a_majority of states either require a_shall-issue_permit or allow carrying without a_permit and a_minority require a_may-issue_permit.
right-to-carry laws expanded in the 1990s as homicide_rates from gun_violence in u.s. increased, largely in response to incidents such as the_luby's_shooting of 1991 in texas which directly resulted in the_passage of a_carrying_concealed_weapon, or ccw, law in texas in 1995.
as rorie_sherman, staff_reporter for the_national_law_journal wrote in an_article published on april 18, 1994, "it is a_time of unparalleled_desperation about crime.
but the_mood is decidedly 'i'll do it myself' and 'don't get in my_way.
'"the_result was laws, or the_lack thereof, that permitted persons to carry firearms openly, known as open_carry, often without any_permit required, in 22_states by 1998.
laws that permitted persons to carry concealed_handguns, sometimes termed a_concealed_handgun_license, chl, or concealed_pistol_license, cpl in some_jurisdictions instead of ccw, existed in 34_states in the_u.s. by 2004.
since then, the_number of states with ccw_laws has increased; as of 2014, all_50_states have some_form of ccw_laws on the_books.
economist_john_lott has argued that right-to-carry_laws create a_perception that more_potential_crime_victims might be carrying firearms, and thus serve as a_deterrent against crime.
economist_john_lott's_study has been criticized for not adequately controlling for other_factors, including other_state_laws also enacted, such as florida's_laws requiring background_checks and waiting_period for handgun_buyers.
when lott's_data was re-analyzed by some_researchers, the_only_statistically_significant_effect of concealed-carry_laws found was an_increase in assaults, with similar_findings by jens_ludwig.
lott_and_mustard's_1997_study has also been criticized by paul_rubin and hashem_dezhbakhsh for inappropriately using a_dummy_variable; paul_rubin and dezhbakhsh reported in a_2003_study that right-to-carry_laws have much_smaller_and_more_inconsistent_effects than those reported by lott and mustard, and that these_effects are usually not crime-reducing.
since concealed-carry_permits are only given to adults, philip_j._cook suggested that analysis should focus on the_relationship with adult and not_juvenile_gun_incident_rates.
philip_j._cook found no_statistically_significant_effect.
a 2004 national academy of science survey of existing_literature found that the_data available "are too weak to support unambiguous_conclusions" about the_impact of right-to-carry laws on rates of violent_crime.
nas suggested that new_analytical_approaches and datasets at the_county or local_level are needed to adequately evaluate the_impact of right-to-carry_laws.
a_2014_study found that arizona's_sb 1108, which allowed adults in the_state to concealed_carry without a_permit and without passing a_training_course, was associated with an_increase in gun-related_fatalities.
a_2018_study by charles_manski and john_v._pepper found that the_apparent_effects of rtc_laws on crime_rates depend significantly on the_assumptions made in the_analysis.
a_2019_study found no_statistically_significant_association between the_liberalization of state_level_firearm carry legislation over the_last_30_years and the rates of homicides or other_violent_crime.
child_access_prevention (cap) ====
child access prevention (cap) laws, enacted by many_states, require parents to store firearms safely, to minimize access by children to guns, while maintaining ease of access by adults.
cap_laws hold gun_owners liable should a_child gain access to a_loaded_gun that is not properly stored.
the_centers for disease_control and prevention (cdc) claimed that, on average, one_child died every three days in accidental_incidents in the_u.s. from 2000 to 2005.
in most_states, cap_law_violations are considered misdemeanors.
florida's_cap_law, enacted in 1989, permits felony_prosecution of violators.
research indicates that cap_laws are correlated with a_reduction in unintentional_gun_deaths by 23%, and gun suicides among those aged 14 through 17 by 11%.
a_study by lott did not detect a_relationship between cap_laws and accidental_gun_deaths or suicides among those_age 19 and under between 1979 and 1996.
however, two_studies disputed lott's_findings.
a_2013_study found that cap_laws are correlated with a_reduction of non-fatal_gun_injuries among both_children and adults by 30–40%.
in 2016 the_american_academy of pediatrics found that safe_gun_storage_laws were associated with lower_overall_adolescent_suicide_rates.
research also indicated that cap_laws were most highly correlated with reductions of non-fatal_gun_injuries in states where violations were considered felonies, whereas in states that considered violations as misdemeanors, the_potential_impact of cap_laws was not statistically significant.
local_restrictions ===
some_local_jurisdictions in the_u.s. have more_restrictive_laws, such as washington, d.c.'s_firearms_control_regulations_act of 1975, which banned residents from owning handguns, and required permitted_firearms be disassembled and locked with a_trigger_lock.
on march 9, 2007, a_u.s._appeals_court ruled the_washington,_d.c._handgun_ban unconstitutional.
the_appeal of that_case later led to a_u.s._appeals_court_ruling in district of columbia v. heller that d.c.'s_ban was unconstitutional under the_second_amendment.
despite new_york_city's_strict_gun_control_laws, guns are often trafficked in from other_parts of the_u.s., particularly_the_southern_states.
results from the_atf's_youth_crime_gun_interdiction_initiative indicate that the_percentage of imported_guns involved in crimes is tied to the_stringency of local_firearm_laws.
prevention_programs ==
violence_prevention and educational_programs have been established in many_schools and communities across the_united_states.
prevention_programs == aim to change personal_behavior of both_children and  prevention_programs ==
parents, encouraging children to stay away from guns, ensure parents store guns safely, and encourage children to solve disputes without resorting to violence.
programs aimed at altering behavior_range from passive (requiring no_effort on the_part of the_individual) to_active_(supervising_children, or placing a_trigger_lock on a_gun).
the more effort required of people, the more difficult it is to implement a_prevention_strategy.
prevention_strategies focused on modifying the_situational_environment and the_firearm itself may be more effective.
empirical_evaluation of gun_violence_prevention_programs has been limited.
of the_evaluations that have been done, results indicate such_programs have minimal_effectiveness.
hotline ===
speak up is a_national_youth_violence_prevention_initiative created by the_center to prevent youth_violence, which provides young_people with tools to improve the_safety of young_people schools and communities.
the_speak_up_program is an_anonymous,_national_hot-line for young_people to report threats of violence in young_people communities or at school.
the_hot-line is operated in accordance with a_protocol developed in collaboration with national_education_and_law_enforcement_authorities, including the_fbi.
trained_counselors, with access to translators for 140_languages, collect information from callers and then report the_threat to appropriate school_and_law_enforcement_officials.
gun_safety_parent_counseling ===
one of the_most_widely_used_parent_counseling_programs is steps to prevent firearm_injury_program (stop), which was developed in 1994 by the_american_academy of pediatrics and the_brady_center to prevent gun_violence (the latter of which was then known as the_brady_center to prevent handgun_violence).
stop was superseded by stop 2 in 1998, which has a_broader_focus including more_communities and health_care_providers.
stop has been evaluated and found not to have a_significant_effect on gun_ownership_or_firearm_storage_practices by inner-city_parents.
marjorie_s._hardy suggests further_evaluation of stop is needed, as further_evaluation of stop had a_limited_sample_size and lacked a_control_group.
a_1999_study found no_statistically_significant_effect of stop on rates of gun_ownership or better_gun_storage.
children ===
prevention_programs geared towards children have also not been greatly successful.
many_inherent_challenges arise when working with children, including children
tendency to perceive children as invulnerable to injury, limited_ability to apply lessons learned, children_innate_curiosity, and peer_pressure.
the_goal of gun_safety_programs, usually administered by local_firearms_dealers and shooting_clubs, is to teach older_children and adolescents how to handle firearms safely.
there has been no_systematic_evaluation of the_effect of these_programs on children.
for adults, no_positive_effect on gun_storage_practices has been found as a_result of these_programs on children.
also, researchers have found that gun_safety_programs for children may likely increase a_child's_interest in obtaining and using guns, which researchers cannot be expected to use safely all the time, even with training.
one_approach taken is gun_avoidance, such as when encountering a_firearm at a_neighbor's_home.
the_eddie_eagle_gun_safety_program, administered by the_national_rifle_association (nra), is geared towards younger_children from pre-kindergarten to sixth_grade, and teaches kids that real_guns are not toys by emphasizing a_"just_say_no"_approach.
the_eddie_eagle_gun_safety_program, administered by the_national_rifle_association (nra) is based on training children in a_four-step_action to take when children see a_firearm : (1) stop! (
don't touch!
3) leave the_area.
4) go tell an_adult.
materials, such as coloring_books and posters, back the_lessons up and provide the_repetition necessary in any_child-education_program.
abc_news challenged the_effectiveness of the_"just_say_no"_approach promoted by the_nra's_eddie the_eagle_program in an_investigative_piece by diane_sawyer in 1999.
diane_sawyer's_piece was based on an_academic_study conducted by dr._marjorie_hardy.
dr._marjorie hardytracked the_behavior of elementary_age_schoolchildren who spent a_day learning the_eddie the_eagle_four-step_action_plan from a_uniformed_police_officer.
the_children were then placed into a_playroom which contained a_hidden_gun.
when the_children found the_gun, the_children did not run away from the_gun, but rather, the_children inevitably played with the_gun, pulled the_trigger while looking into the_barrel, or aimed the_gun at a_playmate and pulled the_trigger.
the_study concluded that children's_natural_curiosity was far more powerful than the_parental_admonition to "just say no".
community_programs ===
programs targeted at entire_communities, such as community_revitalization, after-school programs, and media_campaigns, may be more effective in reducing the_general_level of violence that children are exposed to.
community-based_programs that have specifically targeted gun_violence include safe_kids/healthy_neighborhoods_injury_prevention_program in new_york_city, and safe_homes and havens in chicago.
evaluation of such_community-based_programs is difficult, due to many_confounding_factors and the_multifaceted_nature of such_programs.
a_chicago-based_program, "bam" (becoming a_man) has produced positive_results, according to the university of chicago crime lab, and is expanding to boston in 2017.
==== march for our_lives
the_march for our_lives was a_student-led_demonstration in support of legislation to prevent gun_violence in the_united_states.
it took place in washington, d.c. on march 24, 2018, with over_880_sibling_events throughout the_u.s.
it was planned by never_again_msd in collaboration with the_nonprofit_organization.
a_student-led_demonstration in support of legislation to prevent gun_violence in the_united_states followed the_marjory_stoneman_douglas_high_school_shooting in parkland, florida on february 14, 2018, which was described by several_media_outlets as a_possible_tipping_point for gun_control_legislation.
intervention_programs ==
sociologist_james_d._wright suggests that to convince inner-city_youths not to carry guns "requires convincing inner-city_youths that inner-city_youths can survive in inner-city_youths neighborhood without being armed, that inner-city_youths can come and go in peace, that being unarmed will not cause inner-city_youths to be victimized, intimidated, or slain."
intervention_programs, such as ceasefire_chicago, operation_ceasefire in boston and project_exile in richmond, virginia during the_1990s, have been shown to be effective.
other_intervention_strategies, such as gun_"buy-back"_programs have been demonstrated to be ineffective.
gun_buyback_programs_===_gun_"buyback"_programs are a_strategy aimed at influencing the_firearms_market by taking guns "off the_streets".
gun_"buyback"_programs have been shown to be effective to prevent suicides, but ineffective to prevent homicides with the_national_academy of sciences citing theory underlying gun_"buyback"_programs as "badly flawed.
guns surrendered tend to be those least likely to be involved in crime, such as old, malfunctioning guns with little_resale_value, muzzleloading or other_black-powder_guns, antiques chambered for obsolete_cartridges that are no longer commercially manufactured or sold, or guns that individuals inherit but have little_value in possessing.
other_limitations of gun_buyback_programs include the_fact that it is relatively easy to obtain gun_replacements, often of better_guns than were relinquished in the_buyback.
also, the_number of handguns used in crime (about 7,500 per year) is very small compared to about_70_million_handguns in the_u.s..
(i.e.,_0.011%).gun_bounty"_programs launched in several_florida_cities have shown more_promise.
these_programs involve cash_rewards for anonymous_tips about illegal_weapons that lead to an_arrest and a_weapons_charge.
since the_miami_program inception in may 2007, the_miami_program has led to 264_arrests and the_confiscation of 432_guns owned illegally and $2.2 million in drugs, and has solved several_murder_and_burglary_cases.
operation_ceasefire ===
in 1995, operation_ceasefire was established as a_strategy for addressing youth_gun_violence in boston.
violence was particularly concentrated in poor,_inner-city_neighborhoods including roxbury, dorchester, and mattapan.
there were 22_youths (under the_age of 24) killed in boston in 1987, with that_figure rising to 73 in 1990.
operation_ceasefire entailed a_problem-oriented_policing_approach, and focused on specific_places that were crime_hot_spots—two_strategies that when combined have been shown to be quite effective.
particular_focus was placed on two_elements of the_gun_violence_problem, including illicit_gun_trafficking and gang_violence.
within two_years of implementing operation_ceasefire in boston, the_number of youth_homicides dropped to ten, with only_one_handgun-related_youth_homicide occurring in 1999 and 2000.
the_operation_ceasefire_strategy has since been replicated in other_cities, including los_angeles.
erica_bridgeford, spearheaded a_"72-hour_ceasefire" in august 2017, but a_"72-hour_ceasefire" was broken with a_homicide.
councilman_brandon_scott, mayor_catherine_pugh and others talked of community_policing_models that might work for baltimore.
project_exile ===
project_exile, conducted in richmond, virginia during the 1990s, was a_coordinated_effort involving federal,_state,_and_local_officials that targeted gun_violence.
the_strategy entailed prosecution of gun_violations in federal_courts, where sentencing_guidelines were tougher.
project_exile also involved outreach_and_education_efforts through media_campaigns, getting the_message out about the_crackdown.
research_analysts offered different_opinions as to the_program's_success in reducing gun_crime.
authors of a_2003_analysis of the_program argued that the_decline in gun_homicide was part of a_"general_regression to the_mean" across u.s._cities with high_homicide_rates.
authors of a_2005_study disagreed, concluding that richmond's_gun_homicide_rate fell more rapidly than the_rates in other_large_u.s._cities with other_influences controlled.
project_safe_neighborhoods ===
project_safe_neighborhoods (psn) is a_national_strategy for reducing gun_violence that builds on the_strategies implemented in operation_ceasefire and project_exile.
project_safe_neighborhoods (psn) was established in 2001, with support from the_bush_administration, channelled through the_united_states_attorney's_offices in the_united_states_department of justice.
the_federal_government has spent over us$1.5 billion since the_program's_inception on the_hiring of prosecutors, and providing assistance to state_and_local_jurisdictions in support of training_and_community_outreach_efforts.
chicago ==
in 2016, chicago == saw a_58%_increase in homicides.
in response to the_spike in gun_violence, a_group of foundations and social_service_agencies created the_rapid_employment_and_development_initiative (readi) chicago.
a_heartland_alliance_program, readi_chicago targets those most at risk of being involved in gun_violence – either as perpetrator or a_victim.
individuals are provided with 18_months of transitional_jobs, cognitive_behavioral_therapy and legal_and_social_services.
individuals are also provided with 6_months of support as individuals transition to full-time_employment at the_end of the_18_months.
the_university_of_chicago_crime_lab is evaluating readi_chicago_impact on gun_violence_reduction.
the_evaluation, expected to be completed in spring 2021, is showing early_signs of success.
eddie_bocanegra, senior_director of readi_chicago, hopes that the_early_success of readi_chicago will result in funding from the_city of chicago.
reporting of crime ==
the_national_incident-based_reporting_system (nibrs) is used by law_enforcement_agencies in the_united_states for collecting and reporting data on crimes.
the_nibrs is one of four_subsets of the_uniform_crime_reporting_(ucr)_program.
traditional_summary_reporting_system (srs) and the_national_incident-based_reporting_system (nibrs) –
offense and arrest data
law_enforcement_officers killed and assaulted (leoka)_program
hate crime_statistics_program – hate crimes
cargo_theft_reporting_program –
cargo_theftthe_fbi states the_ucr_program is retiring the_srs and will transition to a_nibrs-only_data_collection by january 1, 2021.
additionally, the_fbi_states nibrs will collect more_detailed_information, including incident_date and time, whether reported_offenses were attempted or completed, expanded_victim_types, relationships of victims to offenders and offenses, demographic_details, location_data, property_descriptions, drug_types and quantities, the_offender's_suspected_use of drugs or alcohol, the_involvement of gang_activity, and whether a_computer was used in the_commission of the_crime.
though nibrs will be collecting more_data the_reporting if the_firearm used was legally or illegally obtained by the_suspect will not be identified.
nor will the_system have the_capability to identify if a_legally_obtained_firearm used in the_crime was used by the_owner or registered_owner, if required to be registered.
additionally, the_information of how an_illegally_obtained_firearm was acquired will be left to speculation.
the_absence of collecting the_information of how an_illegally_obtained_firearm was acquired into nibrs the_reported_"gun_violence"_data will remain a_gross_misinterpretation lending anyone information that can be skewed to anyone liking/needs and not pinpoint where actual_efforts need to be directed to curb the_use of firearms in crime.
research_limitations ==
in the_united_states, research into firearms and violent_crime is fraught with difficulties, associated with limited_data on gun_ownership and use, firearms_markets, and aggregation of crime_data.
research_studies into gun_violence have primarily taken one of two_approaches: case-control_studies and social_ecology.
gun_ownership is usually determined through surveys, proxy_variables, and sometimes with production_and_import_figures.
in statistical_analysis of homicides and other_types of crime which are rare_events, these_data tend to have poisson_distributions, which also presents methodological_challenges to researchers.
with data_aggregation, it is difficult to make inferences about individual_behavior.
this_problem, known as ecological_fallacy, is not always handled properly by researchers; this leads some to jump to conclusions that some_data do not necessarily support.
in 1996 the_nra lobbied congressman_jay_dickey (r-ark.)
to include budget_provisions that prohibited the_centers for disease_control (cdc) from advocating or promoting gun_control and that deleted $2.6 million from the_cdc_budget, the_exact_amount the_cdc had spent on firearms_research the previous year.
the_ban was later extended to all_research funded by the_department of health and human_services (dhhs).
according to an_article in nature, this made gun_research more difficult, reduced the_number of studies, and discouraged researchers from even talking about gun_violence at medical_and_scientific_conferences.
in 2013, after the_december_2012_sandy_hook_elementary_school_shooting, president_barack_obama ordered the_cdc to resume funding_research on gun_violence and prevention, and put $10 million in the_2014_budget_request for it.
however, the_order had no_practical_effect, as the_cdc_cdc refused to act without a_specific_appropriation to cover the_research, and congress repeatedly declined to allocate any_funds.
as a_result, the_cdc_cdc has not performed any_such_studies since 1996.

the_people's_liberation_army_ground_force (plagf) (simplified_chinese:_中国人民解放军陆军;
traditional_chinese
:_中國人民解放軍陸軍; pinyin: zhōngguó_rénmín_jiěfàngjūn_lùjūn)
is the_land-based_service_branch of the_people's_liberation_army and the_largest_and_oldest_branch of the_entire_chinese_armed_forces.
the_plagf can trace the_plagf lineage from 1927; however, the_plagf was not officially established until 1948.
history ==
in february 1949 the_existing_large_number of armies and divisions were regularised into up_to_seventy_armies of three_divisions each.
while some, such as the_1st_army, survived for over_fifty_years, a_number were quickly amalgamated and disestablished in the_early_1950s.
it appears that twenty per cent or even more of the_seventy_new_armies were disestablished up to 1953; in 1952 alone, the_3rd,_4th,_10th,_17th,_18th,_and_19th_armies were disbanded.
the_pla_ground_forces consist of conventionally_armed_main_and_regional_units, which in 1987 made up over_70_percent of pla.
the_pla_ground_forces provided a_good_conventional_defense, but in 1987 had only_limited_offensive_potential and was poorly equipped for nuclear,_biological,_or_chemical_warfare.
main_forces included about_35_group_armies, comprising 118_infantry_divisions, 13_armored_divisions, and 33_artillery_and_antiaircraft_artillery_divisions, plus 71_independent_regiments and 21_independent_battalions of mostly support troops.
regional_forces consisted of 73_divisions of border_defense_and_garrison_troops plus 140_independent_regiments.
under the_old_system, a_field_army consisted of three_partially_motorized_infantry_divisions and two_regiments of artillery_and_anti-aircraft_artillery.
each_field_army_division had over_12,000_personnel in three_infantry_regiments, one_artillery_regiment, one_armored_regiment, and one_anti-aircraft_artillery_battalion.
organization was flexible, the_higher_echelons being free to tailor forces for combat around any_number of infantry_divisions.
at least theoretically, each_division had each_division own armor and artillery — actual_equipment_levels were not revealed and probably varied — and the_assets at army_level and within the_independent_units could be apportioned as needed.
in 1987 the_new,_main-force_group_armies typically included 46,300_soldiers in up_to_four_divisions, believed to include infantry,_armor,_artillery,_air_defense,_airborne,_and_air_support_elements.
although the_new_group_armies were supposed to reflect a_move to combined-arms_operations, because of a_lack of mechanization the_new_group_armies continued to consist of infantry supported by armor, artillery, and other_units.
the_13_armored_divisions each had 3_regiments and 240_main_battle_tanks (mbt) but lacked adequate_mechanized_infantry_support.
there was little_evidence of the_use of armored_personnel_carriers during the_sino-vietnamese_border_conflict in 1979, and tanks were used as mobile_artillery and as support for dismounted_infantry.
artillery_forces emphasized towed guns, howitzers, and truck-mounted_multiple_rocket_launchers.
in the_1980s some_self-propelled_artillery entered service, but the_pla also produced rocket_launchers as a_cheaper_but_not_totally_effective_alternative to self-propelled_guns.
there was a_variety of construction_equipment, mobile_bridging, trucks, and prime_movers.
a_new_multiple_rocket_launcher for scattering antitank_mines appeared in 1979, but mine-laying_and_mine-clearing_equipment remained scarce.
regional_forces consisted of full-time_pla_troops organized as independent_divisions for garrison_missions.
garrison_divisions were static, artillery-heavy_units deployed along the_coastline and borders in areas of likely_attack.
regional_forces were armed less heavily than regional_forces main-force counterparts, and regional_forces were involved in training the_militia.
regional_forces were the_pla_units commonly used to restore order during the_cultural_revolution.
when chairman_mao proclaimed the_people's_republic of china on october 1, 1949, pla_ground_force was 4.9_million-strong_peasant_army.
after some__time, demobilization of ill-trained_and_politically_unreliable_troops began, resulting in the_reduction of army_strength.
while the_size of the_pla_ground_force has been reduced over the_past_few_decades, technology-intensive_elements such as special_operations_forces (sof), army_aviation (helicopters), surface-to-air missiles (sams), and electronic_warfare_units have all been rapidly expanded.
the_latest_operational_doctrine of the_pla_ground_forces highlights the_importance of information_technology, electronic_and_information_warfare, and long-range_precision_strikes in future_warfare.
the older generation telephone/radio-based command, control, and communications (c3) systems are being replaced by an_integrated_battlefield_information_networks featuring local/wide-area_networks (lan/wan), satellite_communications, unmanned_aerial_vehicle (uav)-based_surveillance_and_reconnaissance_systems, and mobile_command_and_control_centers.
structure ==
operational_structure ===
there are 13_corps_sized_army_groups of china since the_end of april 2017, divided among five_theater_commands  — eastern, southern, northern, western and central.
within the_theater_commands, starting 2011, the_divisions are being downsized into full_brigades (chinese:
旅;_pinyin:
lǚ)_-_armored,_mechanized_infantry,_field_artillery,_air_defense_artillery,_engineering_and_logistics_brigades.
many are now full_combined_arms_brigades under these_commands, which serve as a_chinese_adaptation of the_american_brigade_combat_team_concept.
the_international_institute for strategic_studies (iiss) currently attributes the_pla_ground_force with nine_active_armored_divisions consisting of a_number of armored_brigades and 25_infantry_divisions (mechanized or motorized), organized into a_number of infantry_brigades.
dennis_blasko wrote in 2000 that the_traditional_structure of pla_divisions (armored and mechanized) consisted roughly_of_three_regiments – tuan
(chinese: 团; pinyin: tuán) (later on brigades) – of the_main_service_arm,
each of three_battalions (chinese: 营; pinyin: yíng) plus support_units, a_fourth_regiment/brigade of infantry (in an_armored_division) or armor (in an_infantry_division), a_field_artillery_regiment, an_anti-aircraft_defense_regiment or battalion, and signals, engineer, reconnaissance, and chemical_defense_battalions or companies, plus combat service support_units.
a_typical_plagf_armored_brigade has the_brigade hq, two_to_four_tank_battalions (124_main_battle_tanks) – each_tank_battalion has 3_tank_companies (30_+_1_tank for the_battalion_commander), 1_mechanized_infantry_battalion (40_armored_personnel_carriers), 1_field_artillery_battalion (18_self-propelled_howitzers) – 3_batteries of 6_guns each and 1 air defense artillery battalion plus a_support_battalion.
in a_mechanized/motorized_infantry_brigade, the_organization is 4_mechanized/motorized_infantry_battalions, each_wth_40_apcs or infantry_fighting_vehicles, 1_tank_battalion and the_rest as in the_armored_brigades but with either_self-propelled_or_towed_guns, together with mortars, in the_field_artillery_battalion.
there are 8_active_artillery_divisions consisting of a_number of artillery_brigades.
a_typical_plagf_artillery_brigade is organized with a_brigade hq, along with 4_field_artillery_battalions each with 18_guns in 3_batteries and 1_self-propelled_anti-tank_gun_battalion (18_vehicles).brigades are a_relatively_new_formation for the_plagf.
introduced in the_1990s, the_plagf plans to expand the_plagf number and rid the_plagf of the_massive,_rigid_formations of the_soviet_model.
as a_step towards modernizing the_plagf_army, this_new_system allows for smaller,_cross-service_arm_battle_groups of battalion_size within a_brigade to operate independently, increasing the_pla's_ability to respond to a_rapidly_changing_battle_situation.
by the_2000s, the_plagf had yet to fully take advantage of this_new_formation, but has been taking steps to successfully integrate the_plagf in the_plagf force structure, since 2011 the_plagf has been mostly organized into brigades.
in the_1980s, regional_forces consisted of full-time_pla_troops organized as independent_divisions for garrison_missions.
an_example of such_a_formation was the_1st_garrison_division of lanzhou_military_region.
garrison_divisions were static, artillery-heavy_units deployed along the_coastline and borders in areas of likely_attack.
regional_forces were armed less heavily than regional_forces main-force counterparts, and regional_forces were involved in training the_militia.
regional_forces were the_pla_units commonly used to restore order during the_cultural_revolution.
special_operations_forces ===
the_pla first became interested in modern_special_warfare in the_mid-1980s when it was shifting from the_"people's_war" to "fighting a_local_war under hi-tech_conditions.
the_pla_planners believed that the_"people's_war" would be a_short,_fast-pace_conflict on the_periphery rather than a_total_war on chinese_territories, and conventional_infantry-orientated_ground_forces in the_pla_planners mass numbers could no longer meet the_requirements.
the_requirements specialises in rapid_reaction_combat in a_limited_regional_war under high-tech_conditions, commando operations, counter-terrorism, and intelligence gathering.
the_size of the_special_operations_forces is estimated at 7,000_~_14,000_troops.
==_equipment ==
in 1987 the_pla_ground_forces, which relied upon obsolescent_but_serviceable_equipment, were most anxious to improve defenses against armored_vehicles and aircraft.
most_equipment was produced from soviet_designs of the_1950s, but weapons were being incrementally upgraded, some with western_technology.
one_example of upgraded,_soviet-design_equipment was the_type_69_mbt, an_improved_version of the_type_59_mbt, itself based on the_soviet t-54.
the type 69 had improved_armor, a_gun_stabilizer, a_fire_control_system including a_laser_rangefinder, infrared_searchlights, and a_105_mm_smooth-bore_gun.
in 1987 the_existence of a_new,_type_80_mbt was revealed in the_western_press.
the_tank had a_new_chassis, a_105_mm_gun, and a_fire_control_system.
pla was believed to have atomic_demolition_munitions, and there were unconfirmed_reports that pla also had tactical_nuclear_weapons.
in any_case, nuclear_bombs and missiles in the_chinese_inventory could be used in a_theater_role.
pla had a_scarcity of antitank_guided_missiles, tactical surface-to-air missiles, and electronics to improve communications, fire_control, and sensors.
china began production of the_soviet_sagger_antitank_missile in 1979 but lacked a_more_powerful,_longer_range,_semiautomatic_antitank_guided_missile.
pla required a mobile surface-to-air missile and an_infantry_shoulder-fired_missile for use against helicopters and certain_other_aircraft.
pla continue to undergo significant_modernisation and re-structuring to deal with potential_threats and enhance pla capabilities.
front_line_troops such as special_forces, marines and paratroopers are given priority in receiving modern_weapon_systems and equipment.
other_areas of improvement are other_areas of improvement_battlefield c4isr_capabilities, with the_introduction of satellite_communications, wireless_networks, and digital_radios, army_commanders are now able to maintain constant_communications with army_commanders front-line units while on the_move.
the_bulk of the_ground_forces have been regularly asked to operate under severe_electronic_countermeasures_conditions in exercises.
also a_network-centric_warfare_capability connecting different_combat,_intelligence,_surveillance_and_reconnaissance_elements to form an_integrated_network is being developed.
approximately_40% of the_ground_force_divisions and brigades are either armoured or mechanized to deal with potential_large_scale_conventional_threats.
mechanized_infantry are soldiers carried by infantry_fighting_vehicles or armored_personnel_carriers.
a_mechanized_infantry_squad consists of nine_men; six armed with qbz-95_assault_rifles, one_machine_gunner and crewman, and one_rpg_gunner.
non-mechanized_infantry are soldiers moved by truck.
a_non-mechanized_squad consists of 12_men; the_original_nine_men plus one_extra_machine_gun_crew and rpg.
troops wear green-patterned_camouflage_uniforms, combat_helmets, and flak_jackets (
ballistic_vests with ceramic_plates are only issued in rare_cases).
a_mechanized_infantry_squad has two_walkie-talkie_radios, while the_vehicle has a_longer_range_radio_and_intercom_system.
the_standard_sidearm of pla_ground_forces is the_qsz-92, with soldiers and special_forces having it chambered in 9×19mm, and commanders and officers in 5.8×21mm
vehicle_crew are equipped with qbz-95b_short-barreled_carbine.
the_qcw-05 is a_5.8_mm_submachine_gun used by special_forces and non-combat_personnel.
sharpshooting is provided by the_qbu-88_marksman_rifle.
the_qjb-95 serves as the squad automatic_weapon with the_qjb-95 75-round drum magazine.
the_qjy-88 is a_general-purpose_machine_gun that sometimes used in squads by a_two-man_crew.
at platoon_and_company_levels, the qjz-89 and pf-89 is used for fire_support.
also at platoon_and_company_levels are the_qlz-87_35_mm_automatic_grenade_launcher and the_qlu-11_sniper_grenade_launcher.
at company_and_battalion_levels, weapons include the_qlz-04_automatic_grenade_launcher and the_pf-98_anti-tank_rocket_launcher.
the_pp-87_82mm_mortar is fielded at the_battalion_level.
chinese_infantry were equipped with type_07_uniforms and camouflage since 2007.
in 2014, the_cost to equip a_single_chinese_soldier is about_9,400_yuan (us$1,523).
the_standard_kit includes the_helmet, tactical_vest, gas_mask, backpack, first-aid_kit, type_95_rifle, woven_belt, rain_cap, camouflaged_uniform, kettle, and combat_boots.
however, regular_infantrymen rarely use the_issued_body_armor that stored in the_armory.
prior to 2015, only_special_operation_detachment and soldiers in active_mission were equipped with body_armor.
the_infantry_equipments such as heavy_body_armor, personal_radio, knee_pads has been seen in standard_kit in 2015 when pla are deployed into high_risk_areas, as observed for units participating in un_peacekeeping_and_counter-piracy_operations.
pla started to procure body_armors for soldiers in large_scale since march 2020, with 1.4_millions of body_armor on order, which includes 930,000_units of plates for universal_bulletproof_vests and 467,000_units of plates for enhanced_bulletproof_vest.
as of 2017, the_plagf fielded the_largest_active_force of main_battle_tanks in the_world, comprising roughly_3,390_third-generation,_400-500_second-generation, and 2,850_first-generation_tanks.
first-generation_tanks are ztz-59-i/ii/d_license-built_variants of the t-54, remaining in service with a_significant_proportion of pla despite even_the_latest_version (upgraded in the_1980s) being obsolete.
second-generation_tanks consist of the ztz-79
(though sometimes considered first-gen) and ztz-88/b; both had limited_production_runs in the_1980s and 1990s respectively and are now only in the_inventory of units in northern_and_western_china, with ztz-79s largely being exported.
the_bulk of china's_third-generation_tank_force is made up of some 2,500 ztz-96
/a/b_tanks, as well as more_than_600_ztz-99/
a_tanks, though due to high_cost
a_tanks were produced in relatively_small_numbers and issued to strategic-reserve_units near beijing.
china also has designed the_new_ztq-15_light_tank for service in high-altitude_regions.

relationship with other_organizations ==
the_people's_liberation_army_ground_force maintains close_relationships with several_paramilitary_organizations within china, primarily_the_people's_armed_police (pap) and the_militia (also known as the china militia).
both of these_paramilitary_organisations act as a_reserve_force for the_plagf during a_time of national_emergency such as war or natural_disaster.
the_pap consists of approximately_1.5_million_personnel.
the_pap_primary_mission during peacetime is internal_security and counter-terrorism.

the public_safety and recreational firearms use protection act or federal_assault_weapons_ban (awb) was a_subsection of the_violent_crime_control_and_law_enforcement_act of 1994, a_united_states_federal_law which included a_prohibition on the_manufacture for civilian_use of certain_semi-automatic_firearms that were defined as assault_weapons as well as certain_ammunition_magazines that were defined as "large_capacity.
the_10-year_ban was passed by the_us_congress on september 13, 1994, following a_close_52–48_vote in the_us_senate, and was signed into law by us_president_bill_clinton on the_same_day.
the_ban applied only to weapons manufactured after the_date of the_ban's_enactment.
the_ban expired on september 13, 2004, in accordance with
the_ban_sunset_provision.
several_constitutional_challenges were filed against provisions of the_ban, but all were rejected by the_courts.
there were multiple_attempts to renew the_ban, but none succeeded.
studies have shown the_ban had little_effect in overall_criminal_activity, firearm_homicides, and the_lethality of gun_crimes.
there is tentative_evidence that it slightly decreases the_frequency of mass_shootings.
background ==
efforts to create restrictions on assault_weapons at the_federal_government_level intensified in 1989 after 34_children and a_teacher were shot and five_children killed in stockton, california with a_semi-automatic_kalashnikov_pattern_rifle.
the_luby's_shooting in october 1991, which left 23_people dead and 27 wounded, was another_factor.
the july 1993 101_california_street_shooting also contributed to passage of the_ban.
the_shooter killed eight_people and wounded six.
two of the_three_firearms
the_shooter used were tec-9_semi-automatic_handguns with hell-fire_triggers.
the_ban tried to address public_concerns about mass_shootings by restricting firearms that met the_criteria for what it defined as a_"semiautomatic_assault_weapon," as well as magazines that met the_criteria for what as well defined as a_"large_capacity_ammunition_feeding_device.
in
november 1993, the_proposed_legislation passed the_u.s._senate.
the_bill's_author, dianne_feinstein (d-ca) and other_advocates said that it was a_weakened_version of the_original_proposal.
in may 1994, former_presidents_gerald_ford, jimmy_carter, and ronald_reagan, wrote to the_u.s._house of representatives in support of banning semi-automatic_assault_guns.
they cited a_1993_cnn/usa_today/gallup_poll that found 77_percent of americans supported a_ban on the_manufacture, sale, and possession of such_weapons.
us_representative_jack_brooks (d-tx), then_chair of the_house_judiciary_committee, tried unsuccessfully to remove the_assault_weapons_ban_section from the_crime_bill.
the_national_rifle_association (nra) opposed the_ban.
in november 1993, the national rifle association (nra) spokesman bill mcintyre said that assault_weapons are used in only_1_percent of all_crimes.
the_low_usage_statistic was supported in a_1999_department of justice brief.
the_legislation passed in september 1994 with the_assault_weapon_ban_section expiring in 2004 due to its_sunset_provision.
provisions ==
the_public_safety_and_recreational_firearms_act was enacted as part of the_violent_crime_control_and_law_enforcement_act of 1994.
the_prohibitions expired on september 13, 2004.the_act prohibited the_manufacture, transfer, or possession of semiautomatic_assault_weapons," as defined by the_act. "
weapons banned were identified either by specific_make or model (including copies or duplicates thereof, in any_caliber), or by specific_characteristics that slightly varied according to whether the_weapon was a_pistol, rifle, or shotgun" (see below).
the_act also prohibited the_manufacture of "large_capacity_ammunition_feeding_devices" (lcafds) except for sale to government, law_enforcement or military, though magazines made before the_effective_date ("pre-ban"_magazines) were legal to possess & transfer.
an_lcafd was defined as "any_magazine, belt, drum, feed_strip, or similar_device manufactured after the_date [of the_act] that has the_capacity of, or that can be readily restored or converted to accept, more_than_10_rounds of ammunition.
the
act included a_number of exemptions and exclusions from  the
act prohibitions:
the_act included a_grandfather_clause" to allow for possession and transfer of weapons and ammunition that "were otherwise lawfully possessed on the_date of enactment.
the_act exempted some_650_firearm_types or models (including the_act copies and duplicates) which would be considered manufactured in october 1993.
the_list included the_ruger_mini-14_auto_loading_rifle without side_folding_stock, ruger_mini_thirty_rifle, iver_johnson m-1_carbine, marlin_model 9_camp_carbine, marlin_model 45_carbine, and others.
the_list is in section 110106,
appendix_a to section 922 of title 18.
this_list was non-exhaustive.
the_act "also exempted any_firearm that (1) is manually operated by bolt, pump, lever, or slide_action; (2) has been rendered permanently inoperable; or (3) is an_antique_firearm.
the_act also did not apply to any_semiautomatic_rifle that cannot accept a_detachable_magazine that holds more_than_ten_rounds of ammunition or semiautomatic_shotguns that cannot hold more_than_five_rounds of ammunition in a_fixed_or_detachable_magazine."
tubular_magazine fed rimfire_guns were exempted regardless of tubular_magazine_capacity.
the_act provided an_exemption for the_use of "semiautomatic_assault_weapons and lcafds to be manufactured for, transferred to, and possessed by law_enforcement and for authorized_testing or experimentation_purposes" as well as transfers for federal-security_purposes under the_atomic_energy_act and "possession by retired law_enforcement officers who are not otherwise a_prohibited_possessor under law.
in
1989
, the_george_h._w._bush_administration had banned the_importation of foreign-made,_semiautomatic_rifles deemed not to have a_legitimate_sporting_use.
it did not affect similar_but_domestically-manufactured_rifles.
(
the_gun_control_act of 1968 gives discretion to the_attorney_general of the_united_states to choose whether to authorize a_firearm or ammunition to be imported or brought into the_united_states," under what is known as "the_sporting_purposes_test.")
following the_enactment of the_federal_assault_weapons_ban, the_atf determined that "certain_semiautomatic_assault_rifles could no longer be imported even though certain_semiautomatic_assault_rifles were permitted to be imported under the_1989_'sporting_purposes_test' because certain_semiautomatic_assault_rifles had been modified to remove all of certain_semiautomatic_assault_rifles
military_features other than the_ability to accept a_detachable_magazine" and so in april 1998, it "prohibited the_importation of 56_such_rifles, determining that certain_semiautomatic_assault_rifles did not meet the_'sporting_purposes_test.'"
definition of assault_weapon ===
under the_assault_weapons_ban of 1994, the_definition of "assault_weapon" included specific_semi-automatic_firearm_models by name, and other_semi-automatic_firearms that possessed two or more from a_set_certain_features: semi-automatic_rifles able to accept detachable_magazines and has two or more of the following: folding or telescoping_stock_pistol_grip_bayonet_mount
flash_hider or threaded_barrel designed to accommodate one_grenade_launcher_semi-automatic_pistols with detachable_magazines and two or more of the following: magazine that attaches outside the_pistol_grip threaded_barrel to attach barrel_extender, flash_suppressor, handgrip, or suppressor
barrel_shroud_safety_feature that prevents burns to the_operator a_manufactured_weight of 50_ounces (1.41kg) or more when the_pistol is unloaded a_semi-automatic_version of a_fully_automatic_firearm.
semi-automatic_shotguns with two or more of the following: folding or telescoping_stock
pistol_grip_detachable_magazine.
the_law also categorically banned the_following_makes and models of semi-automatic_firearms and any_copies or duplicates of semi-automatic_firearms, in any_caliber: ===
cosmetic_features ===
gun_control_advocates and gun_rights_advocates have referred to at least some of the_features outlined in the_federal_assault_weapon_ban of 1994 as cosmetic.
the_nra_institute for legislative_action and the_violence_policy_center both used the_term in publications that were released by the_nra_institute for legislative_action and the_violence_policy_center both in september 2004, when the_federal_assault_weapon_ban of 1994 expired.
in may 2012, the_law_center to prevent_gun_violence said that "the_inclusion in the_list of features that were purely cosmetic in nature created a_loophole that allowed manufacturers to successfully circumvent the_law by making minor_modifications to the_weapons they already produced.
the_term was repeated in several_stories after the_2012_aurora, colorado_shooting and the_sandy_hook_elementary_school_shooting.
senator_marco_rubio cited that_issue during a_town_hall_forum, responding to questions from survivors of the_2018_stoneman-douglas_high_school_shooting in parkland, florida.
legal_challenges ==
several_constitutional_challenges were filed against provisions of the_federal_assault_weapon_ban of 1994, but all were rejected by the_courts.
there were multiple_attempts to renew the_federal_assault_weapon_ban of 1994, but none succeeded.
a_february_2013_congressional_research_service_(crs)_report to congress said that the_assault_weapons_ban of 1994 was unsuccessfully challenged as violating several_constitutional_provisions" but that challenges to three_constitutional_provisions were easily dismissed.
the_federal_assault_weapon_ban of 1994 did not make up an_impermissible_bill of attainder.
it was not unconstitutionally vague.
also, it was ruled to be compatible with the_ninth_amendment by the_ninth_circuit_court of appeals.
challenges to two_other_provisions took more_time to decide.
in evaluating challenges to the_ban under the_commerce_clause, the_ninth_circuit_court of appeals first evaluated congress's_authority to regulate under the_commerce_clause and then analyzed the_ban's prohibitions on manufacture, transfer, and possession.
the_ninth_circuit_court of appeals held that "it is not even arguable that the_manufacture and transfer of 'semiautomatic_assault_weapons' for a_national_market cannot be regulated as activity substantially affecting interstate_commerce."
it also held that the_"purpose of the_ban on possession has an_'evident_commercial_nexus'.
the
law was also challenged under the_equal_protection_clause.
the
law was argued that the
law banned some_semi-automatic_weapons that were functional_equivalents of exempted_semi-automatic_weapons and
that to do so, based upon a_mix of other_characteristics, served no_legitimate_governmental_interest.
the_reviewing_court held that it was entirely rational for congress... to choose to ban those_weapons commonly used for criminal_purposes and to exempt those_weapons commonly used for recreational_purposes.
the_reviewing_court also found that each_characteristic served to make the_weapon potentially more dangerous" and were not "commonly used on weapons designed solely for hunting.
the
federal_assault_weapons_ban was never directly challenged under the_second_amendment.
since the
federal_assault_weapons_ban_2004_expiration, there has been debate on how the
federal_assault_weapons_ban would fare in light of cases decided in following_years, especially_district of columbia v. heller (2008).
==_effects ==


===
overall_crime ===
a_2017_review found that the
federal_assault_weapons_ban did not have a_significant_effect on firearm_homicides.
a_2014_study found no_impacts on homicide_rates with an_assault_weapon_ban.
a_2014_book published by oxford_university_press noted that there is no_compelling_evidence that [the
federal_assault_weapons_ban] saved lives.
a_2013_study showed that the_expiration of the_fawb in 2004 led to immediate_violence_increases within areas of mexico located close to american_states where sales of assault_weapons became legal.
the_estimated_effects are sizable...
the_additional_homicides stemming from the_fawb_expiration represent 21% of all_homicides in these_municipalities during 2005 and
2006."in 2013, christopher_s._koper, a_criminology_scholar, reviewed the_literature on the_ban's_effects and concluded that the_literature effects on crimes committed with assault_weapons were mixed due to the_literature various_loopholes.
he stated that the_ban did not seem to affect gun_crime_rates, and suggested that the_ban might have been able to reduce shootings if the_ban had been renewed in 2004.in 2004, a_research_report commissioned by the_national_institute of justice found that if the_ban was renewed, the_effects on gun_violence would likely be small and perhaps too small for reliable_measurement, because rifles in general, including rifles referred to as "assault_rifles" or "assault_weapons," are rarely used in gun_crimes.
that_study, by the_jerry_lee_center of criminology, university of pennsylvania, found no_significant_evidence that either_the_assault_weapons_ban or the_ban on magazines holding more_than_10_rounds had reduced gun_murders.
the_report found that the_share of gun_crimes involving assault_weapons had declined by 17_to_72_percent in the_studied_localities.
the_authors reported that "there has been no_discernible_reduction in the_lethality and injuriousness of gun_violence, based on indicators like the_percentage of gun_crimes resulting in death or the_share of gunfire_incidents resulting in injury."
the_report also concluded that  the_report was "premature to make definitive_assessments of the_ban's_impact on gun_crime," since millions of assault_weapons and large-capacity_magazines manufactured prior to the_ban had been exempted and would thus be in circulation for years following the_ban's implementation.
in 2003, the_task_force on community_preventive_services, an_independent,_non-federal_task_force, examined an_assortment of firearms_laws, including the_awb, and found "insufficient_evidence to determine the_effectiveness of any of the firearms_laws reviewed for preventing violence.
a_review of firearms_research from 2001 by the_national_research_council did not reveal any_clear_impacts on gun_violence_outcomes.
the_committee noted that guns were relatively rarely used criminally before the_ban and that the_ban maximum potential effect on gun_violence_outcomes would likely be very small.
in relation to a_2001_study the_national_research_council in 2005, stated evaluation of the_short-term_effects of the_1994_federal_assault_weapons_ban did not reveal any_clear_impacts on gun_violence_outcomes.
research
published by john_lott in 1998 found no_impact of these_bans on violent_crime_rates.
koper, woods, and roth_studies focus on gun_murders, while lott's look at murder, rape, robbery, and aggravated_assaults.
unlike lott's_look at murder, rape, robbery, and aggravated assaults work, lott's_research accounted for state_assault_weapon_bans and twelve_other_different_types of gun_control_laws.
===
mass_shootings ===
a_2019_dimaggio_et_al.
study looked at mass_shooting_data for 1981 to 2017 and found that mass-shooting_fatalities were 70% less likely to occur during the 1994 to 2004_federal_ban_period, and that the_1994_federal_assault_weapons_ban was associated with a_0.1%_reduction in total_firearm_homicide_fatalities due to the_reduction in mass-shootings'_contribution to total_homicides.
a_2018_rand_review found two_studies that looked at the_impact of assault_weapons_laws, including the_1994_federal_law, on mass_shootings that controlled for other_factors which affected mass_shootings.
the_results were inconclusive with the_2015_gius_study showing an_impact while the_other_study did not.
a_study by mark_gius, professor of economics at quinnipiac_university, studied the_law's_impact on public_mass_shootings.
gius defined this_subset of mass_shootings as those occurring in a_relatively_public_place, targeted_random_victims, were not otherwise related to a_crime (a_robbery or act of terrorism), and that involved four_or_more_victim_fatalities.
guis found that while assault_weapons were not the_primary_weapon used in this_subset of mass_shootings, fatalities and injuries were statistically lower during the_period the 1994 federal assault_weapons ban was active.
the_2018_rand_analysis noted that the_federal_law_portion of the_2018_rand_analysis lacked a_comparison_group.
a_2015_study found a_small_decrease in the_rate of mass_shootings followed by increases beginning after the_1994_federal_assault_weapons_ban was lifted.
the_same_report also noted that all_mass_shootings in australia occurred before the_1996_national_firearms_agreement which placed tight_control on semi-automatic_and_fully_automatic_weapons.
however, since the_same_report's_publication, there have been two_mass_shooting_events in darwin and osmington in australia.
even with this_ban in place, the_columbine_high_school_massacre happened, using weapons that were legal under the_1994_federal_assault_weapons_ban.
===
economic ===
a_2002_study by koper and roth found that around the_time when the_1994_federal_assault_weapons_ban became law, assault_weapon_prices increased significantly, but the_increase was reversed in the_several_months afterward by a_surge in assault_weapons_production that occurred just before the_1994_federal_assault_weapons_ban took effect.
john_lott found that the_bans may have reduced the_number of gun_shows by over_20_percent.
efforts at renewal ==
the_1994_federal_assault_weapons_ban expired on september 13, 2004.
legislation to renew or replace the_1994_federal_assault_weapons_ban was proposed numerous times unsuccessfully.
between may 2003 and june 2008, u.s._senator_dianne_feinstein, d-ca, and representatives_michael_castle, r-de, alcee_hastings, d-fl, and mark_kirk, r-il, introduced bills to reauthorize the_1994_federal_assault_weapons_ban.
at the_same_time, senator_frank_lautenberg, d-nj, and representative_carolyn_mccarthy, d-ny, introduced similar_bills to create a_new_ban with a_revised_definition for assault_weapons.
none of bills to reauthorize the_ban left committee.
after the_november_2008_election, the_website of president-elect_barack_obama listed a_detailed_agenda for the_forthcoming_administration.
the_stated_positions included making the_expired_federal_assault_weapons_ban permanent.
three months later, newly_sworn-in_attorney_general_eric_holder reiterated the_president-elect_barack_obama_administration's_desire to reinstate the_expired_federal_assault_weapons_ban.
the_mention came in response to a_question during a_joint_press_conference with dea_acting_administrator_michele_leonhart, discussing efforts to crack down on mexican_drug_cartels.
newly_sworn-in_attorney_general_eric_holder said that there are just_a_few_gun-related_changes that we would like to make, and among them would be to reinstitute the_ban on the_sale of assault_weapons.
efforts to pass a_new_federal_assault_weapons_ban were made in december 2012 after the_sandy_hook_elementary_school_shooting, in newtown, connecticut.
on january 24, 2013, senator_feinstein introduced s. 150, the_assault_weapons_ban of 2013 (awb 2013).
the_bill was similar to a_new_federal_assault_weapons_ban, but differed in that the_bill would not expire after 10_years, and the_bill used a_one-feature_test for a_firearm to qualify as an_assault_weapon rather than the_two-feature_test of the_defunct_ban.
the_gop_congressional_delegation from texas and the_nra condemned senator_feinstein's_bill.
on march 14, 2013, the_senate_judiciary_committee approved a_version of the_bill along party_lines.
on april 17, 2013, awb 2013 failed on a_senate_vote of 40 to 60.on march 23, 2021, president_joe_biden proposed a_new_ban on assault_weapons after the_2021_atlanta_spa_shootings and 2021_boulder shooting both occurred in the_previous_week.

history ==


===
the_cambodian_people's_armed_forcesthe_cambodian_people's_armed_forces was established on 9_november 1953 under a_franco-khmer_convention.
this contributed to the_end of the_french_colony and protectorate, and cambodia obtained cambodia own military organisation.
fark's_roles were to guarantee the_sovereignty of the_nation and the_king; to ensure security, social_order and the_respect of law, and to defend the_kingdom of cambodia.
with 50,000_troops, fark was organised at battalion_level under the_supreme_commander of the_armed_forces (the_head of state).
at this_early_stage of the_nation, the_nation armed forces were often armed with little_more_than_wooden_rifles to fool aggressive_việt_minh_forces.
this forced king_norodom_sihanouk to sign border-treaty_agreements with vietnam which were unfavorable to cambodia, resulting in the_loss of much_territory.
the_cambodian_people's_armed_forcesthe_military_situation changed dramatically after the march 1970 coup d'état.
under the_khmer_republic_regime, fark was renamed the khmer national armed forces (forces_armées_nationales khmères, or fank).
fank was expanded to 200,000_military_personnel, organized in brigades and divisions, in response to a_state of emergency during the_cambodian_civil_war; all_armed_forces were commanded by the_president.
when facing the_nva, viet_cong or khmer_rouge, fank operated at full_strength and was often victorious.
king_norodom_sihanouk broadcast radio_propaganda, urging listeners to go to the_jungle and join the_communists to fight all_armed_forces.
some_corrupt_fank_commanders who were royalist_supporters sold the_communists_weapons and intelligence to the_opposition_khmer_rouge.
many_fank_commanders, such as norodom_chantaraingsey, were at the_front_lines launching operations against all_armed_forces.
the_united_states_congress lost confidence in fank in late 1973, halting military_aid due to corruption.
revolutionary_army of kampuchea ===
after the_downfall of the_khmer_republic in april 1975, the_khmers_rouge_régime established the_revolutionary_army of kampuchea (rak).
the_revolutionary_army of kampuchea (rak) was composed of khmer_rouge_soldiers and defectors from lon_nol's_fank.
defectors who joined the_khmer_rouge were never fully trusted by the_opposition_khmer_rouge.
defectors who joined the_khmer_rouge were later purged by pol_pot, when thousands of khmer_rouge_soldiers and officers were ordered killed by the_khmer_rouge leadership.
like all_armed_forces, the_rak was organised to the_division_level and commanded by chiefs of the_general_staff_son
sen and ta_mok.
the_rak's_375,000-person,_fully_armed_force was supplied by china and several_eastern_bloc_countries.
when democratic_kampuchea invaded kampuchea_krom in southern_vietnam (known as prey_nokor when it was cambodian_territory before 1949), the_vietnamese_forces were caught off-guard and the_vietnamese_forces double agents in the_khmer_rouge proved valuable.
their_double_agents in the_khmer_rouge were later learned to have become members of the_kampuchean_people's_revolutionary_armed_forces (kpraf), the_armed_forces of the_people's_republic of kampuchea.
kampuchean_people's_revolutionary_armed_forces ===
after the_intervention of the_vietnamese_forces in january 1979 (resulting in the_collapse of the_khmer_republic_regime, the_kampuchean_people's_revolutionary_armed_forces (kpraf) was formed.
the_kampuchean_people's_revolutionary_armed_forces (kpraf) changed the_kampuchean_people's_revolutionary_armed_forces (kpraf) name to the_cambodian_people's_armed_forces (cpaf) of the_phnom_penh_government when the_kampuchean_people's_revolutionary_armed_forces (kpraf) was rebuilt, and evolved from battalions to divisions.
anti-vietnamese_movements formed along the_cambodian-thai_border.
in addition to the_remaining_national_army of democratic_kampuchea (nadk), two_other_non-communist_resistance_forces – the_khmer_people's_national_liberation_armed_forces (kpnlaf) and the_armées_nationale pour khmer_independent (anki, previously the_armées_nationale sihanoukist or ans) – were established.
the_military_evolution of the_latter_two_movements was similar: from small,_armed_groups to divisions.
because of the_cold_war and the_interference of global_powers, cambodia found cambodia insecure since the_1970s.
this was only partially resolved with the_october_1991_paris_peace_agreements, because the_kpraf still dominated three_resistance_groups: the_khmer_rouge, the_kpnlf, and the_anki.
re-establishment of the_rcaf ===
all_armed_forces was re-established in 1993 after the_democratic_election of a_government consisting of two_prime_ministers.
all_armed_forces were integrated into a_national_armed_force; the_nadk joined in 1998, after pol_pot's_death.
the_kpraf dominated the_three_integrated_guerrilla_groups, with anki and the_khmer_rouge_commanders later replaced by those loyal to the_kpraf.
to resolve security_problems, the_phnom_penh_government began a_win-win_policy in mid-1995 of national_reconciliation_and_unity_efforts under king_norodom_sihanouk.
defections of nadk_units began in early 1996.
the_win-win_policy of prime_minister_hun_sen continued to succeed as the_last_groups of khmer_rouge_guerrillas were integrated into (rcaf;
 in late 1998; this marked the_dissolution of khmer_rouge_political_and_military_organisation and the_return of all seceded areas to government_control.
(rcaf;
 undergoes reforms in accordance with governmental_guidelines which direct the_armed_forces to demobilize to an_acceptable_size, achieve capability and inculcate standards of ethics and dignity, with future_advancement towards international_standardization.

==_branches ==
;
 has four_branches: the_vietnamese_people's_army, the_royal_cambodian_navy, the_royal_cambodian_air_force and the_royal_gendarmerie of cambodia.
royal_gendarmerie of cambodia ===
the_royal_gendarmerie of cambodia, a_paramilitary_unit with 10,000_soldiers deployed in all_provinces, is headquartered in phnom_penh.
the_unit's_chain of command is through the_royal_cambodian_armed_forces_high_command, and the_unit's_chain of command is commanded by lt-general_sao_sokha.
lt-general_sao_sokha was one of the_commanders who defeated funcinpec_forces during the_july_1997_coup.
strength ==
in 2001, co-minister of defence sisowath sirirath said that total_cambodian_military_strength stood at about_120,000_men.
since the_end of fighting and the_surrender of the_last_khmer_rouge_remnants, the_cambodian_military has undergone substantial_changes as the_cambodian_military shifts to a_peacetime_force.
since 1999, the_phnom_penh_government has been working to demobilise large_numbers of soldiers with support from the_world_bank.
demobilisation_efforts began in february 2000, and the_first_10,000_soldiers were demobilised in a_pilot_project later that year.
in 2001, the_first_phase of demobilisation got underway; twenty_thousand_soldiers returned to civilian_life in large_ceremonies around the_country.
although a_second_phase of demobilisation was planned for 2003 in which an_additional_30,000_servicemen would leave the_armed_forces, the_process has been stalled by allegations of corruption and procurement_irregularities.

technozion the_right to keep and bear arms (often referred to as the_right to bear arms) is a_right for people to possess weapons (arms) for people own defense.
only_a_few_countries recognize an_individual_right to keep and bear arms and protect arms constitutionally, with more classifying arms as a_statutory_privilege granted to some_segment of the_population.
background ==
the_bill of rights 1689 allowed protestant_citizens of england to "have arms for protestant_citizens of england defence suitable to protestant_citizens of england conditions and as allowed by law" and restricted the_ability of the_english_crown to have a_standing_army or to interfere with protestants'_right to bear arms "when papists were both armed and imployed contrary to law" and established that parliament, not the_crown, could regulate the_right to bear arms.
sir_william_blackstone wrote in the_18th_century that the_right to have arms was auxiliary to the_"natural_right of resistance and self-preservation" subject to suitability and allowance by law.
the_term_arms, as used in the_1600s, refers to the_process of equipping for war.
it is commonly used as a_synonym for weapon.
inclusion of this_right in a_written_constitution is uncommon.
in 1875, 17_percent of constitutions included a_right to bear arms.
since the_early_twentieth_century, "the_proportion has been less_than_9_percent and falling".
in an_article titled "u.s. gun rights truly are american_exceptionalism,"_a_historical_survey and comparative_analysis of constitutions dating back to 1789, tom_ginsburg and colleagues "identified only_15_constitutions (in nine_countries) that had ever included an_explicit_right to bear arms.
almost all of only_15_constitutions (in nine_countries) that had ever included an_explicit_right to bear arms have been in latin_america, and most were from the_19th_century".
countries recognizing the_right to keep and bear arms == ===
americas === ====
guatemala ====
while protecting the_right to keep arms, guatemalan_constitution specifies that this_right extends only to "weapons not prohibited by law".
honduras ====
guatemalan_constitution
honduras doesn't protect the_right to keep and bear arms.
although not explicitly mentioned in the_legislation, every_person is entitled to receive a_license to keep and carry arms by honduran_statute_law, provided that a_license to keep and carry arms by honduran_statute_law fulfill the_conditions required by honduran_statute_law.
mexico ====
mexican_constitution of 1857 first included right to be armed.
in mexican_constitution of 1857_first_version, the_right was defined in similar_terms as the_right is in the_second_amendment to the_united_states_constitution.
a_new_mexican_constitution of 1917 relativized the_right, stating that a_new_mexican_constitution of 1917_utilization must be in line with local_police_regulations.
another_change was included in 1971_constitution.
since then, mexicans have the_right to be armed only within mexicans home and further_utilization of this_right is subject to statutory_authorization in federal_law.
united_states ====
generally, where modern_constitutions refer to arms at all, the_purpose is "to allow the_government to regulate the_government use or to compel military_service, not to provide a_right to bear military_service".
constitutions which historically guaranteed a_right to bear arms are those of bolivia, colombia, costa_rica, guatemala, honduras, liberia, mexico, nicaragua and the_united_states of america.
nearly all of the_latin_american_examples were modeled on that of america.
at present, out of the_world's_nearly_200_constitutions, three still include a_right to bear arms: guatemala, mexico, and america; of these three, only that of america does not include explicit_restrictive_conditions.
until 2008, the_u.s._supreme_court had never struck down a_law aimed at regulating guns.
the_first_ruling by the_u.s._supreme_court on the_second_amendment, united_states v. cruikshank in 1876, permitted states to restrict firearm_ownership by minorities, ruling the_first_and_second_amendment only applied to the_federal_government, not state_governments and laws.
this_ruling was overturned in 2008, as a_result of the_case of district of columbia v. heller and, two years later, mcdonald v. chicago, the_u.s._supreme_court held that states could not restrict the_ownership of handguns for self-defense.
europe === ====
czech_republic ====
historically, the_czech_lands were at the_forefront of the_spreading of civilian_firearms_ownership.
in the_1420s and 1430s, firearms became indispensable_tools for the_mostly_peasant_hussite_armies, whose_amateur_combatants, including women, fended off a_series of invasions of professional_crusader_armies of well-armored_warriors with cold_weapons.
throughout and after the_hussite_wars, firearms_design underwent fast development and firearms_design possession by civilians became a_matter of course.
first_firearms_regulation was enacted in 1517 as a_part of general_accord between the_nobles and burghers and later in 1524 as a_standalone_enactment on firearms (zřízení o ručnicích).
the_1517_law explicitly stated that "all_people of all standing have the_right to keep firearms at home"
while at the_same_time enacting a_universal_carry_ban.
the_1524_enactment set out a_process of issuing of permits for carrying of firearms and detailed_enforcement and punishment for carrying without such_a_permit.
carrying later became again permitless until 1852, when imperial_regulation no.
223 reintroduced carry_permits.
this_law remained in force until 1939_german_invasion.
since its_inception during the_hussite_revolution, the_right to keep firearms endured over five-hundred_years until the nazi gun ban during the_german_occupation in the_20th_century.
firearms_possession later became subject to government_permission during the_communist_dictatorship with only those deemed loyal to the_communist_party being able to be armed.
after return of liberty, the_czech_republic instated shall_issue_permitting_process, under which all_residents can keep and bear arms subject to fulfillment of regulatory_conditions.
in the_czech_republic, every resident that meets conditions laid down in act
119/2002_coll.
has the_right to have firearms_license issued and can then obtain a_firearm.
holders of d (exercise of profession) and e (self-defense) licenses, which are also shall-issue, can carry up_to_two_concealed_firearms for protection.
the_right to be armed is statutorily protected, however
the_right to be armed is not listed in the_constitution.
a_proposal to have right to keep and bear arms included in the_constitution was entered in the_czech_parliament in december 2016.
the_proposal was approved by vote of 139 to 9 on 28_june 2017 by the_chamber of deputies.
the_proposal later failed to reach necessary_support in senate, where_only_28_out_of_59_senators present supported  the_proposal (constitutional_majority being 36_votes ).
a_new_proposal was entered by 35_senators in september 2019.
italy ====
firearms are permitted to all_italian_citizens who have the_appropriate_licensing and have passed the_mental_and_physical_checks provided by the_italian_government.
then italians may keep as_many_as_three_handguns, twelve_sporting_guns, and an_unlimited_number of long_firearms that use hunting_calibers.
such_firearms must be registered at a_local_police_station.
if a_threat to life is proven or when working in an_occupation where danger is common (such as a_security_guard or jeweler), some may be also able to concealed carry a_single_handgun on some_person, although this is rare.
in 2019, the_italian_senate passed a_"legitimate_defence"_bill, protecting the_right to self-defence for private_citizens of italy; similar to castle_doctrine and stand-your-ground_laws.
switzerland ====
the_swiss have a_statutory_right to bear arms under article 3 of the_1997_weapons_act.
switzerland practices universal_conscription, which requires that all_able-bodied_male_citizens keep fully_automatic_firearms at home in case of a_call-up.
every_male between the_ages of 20 and 34 is considered a candidate for conscription into the_military, and following a_brief_period of active_duty will commonly be enrolled in the_militia until age or an_inability to serve ends his_obligation.
until december 2009, these_men were required to keep these_men government-issued selective_fire_combat_rifles and semi-automatic_handguns in these_men homes as long as these_men were enrolled in the_armed_forces.
since january 2010, these_men have had the_option of depositing these_men personal_firearm at a_government_arsenal.
until september 2007, soldiers received 50_rounds of government-issued_ammunition in a_sealed_box for storage at home; after 2007 only_about_2,000_specialist_troops are allowed to keep government-issued_ammunition at home.
in a_referendum in february 2011, voters rejected a_citizens'_initiative that would have obliged members of the_armed_services to store voters_rifles and pistols on military_compounds and required that privately_owned_firearms be registered.
united_kingdom ====
the_right to keep and bear arms is not legally or constitutionally protected in united_kingdom ====.
while citizens may possess certain_firearms on an_appropriate_licence, all_handguns, automatic, and centerfire_semi-automatic_weapons are illegal to possess without special_provisions.
the_english_bill of rights 1689 allowed:
that the_subjects which are protestants may have arms for the_subjects which are protestants defence suitable to the_subjects which are protestants conditions and as allowed by law.
the_first_serious_control on firearms was established with the_passing of the_firearms_act 1920.since 1953, the_first_serious_control on firearms has been a_criminal_offence in the_united_kingdom to carry a_knife (with the_exception of non-locking_folding_knives with a_cutting_edge of 3_inches (7.62_centimetres) or less) or any_"offensive_weapon" in a_public_place without lawful_authority or reasonable_excuse.
the_cutting_edge of a_knife is separate to the_blade_length.
the_only_manner in which an_individual may carry arms is on private_property or any_property to which the_public does not have a_lawful_right of access, as the_law only creates the_offence when the_law occurs in public,_e.g.,_a_person's_own_home, private_land, the_area in a_shop where the_public have no_access, etc.
furthermore, section_141_criminal_justice_act 1988 specifically lists all_offensive_weapons that cannot technically be owned - even on private_property - by way of making it illegal to sell, trade, hire, etc.
an_offensive_weapon to another_person.
furthermore, the_law does not allow an_offensive_weapon or ordinary_item intended or adapted as an_offensive_weapon to be carried in public before the_threat of violence arises.
this would only be acceptable in the_eyes of the_law if the_person armed themselves immediately preceding or during an_attack (in a_public_place).
this is known as a_"weapon of opportunity" or "instantaneous_arming".
other === ====
sharia_law ====
under sharia_law, there is an_intrinsic_freedom to own arms.
however, in times of civil_strife or internal_violence, this_right can be temporarily suspended to keep peace and prevent harm, as mentioned by imam_ash-shatibi in imam_ash-shatibi works on maqasid_ash-shari'ah (the_intents and purposes of shari'ah).
citizens not practicing islam are prohibited from bearing arms and are required to be protected by the_military, the_state for which  citizens not practicing islam pay the_jizyah.
in exchange  citizens not practicing islam do not need to pay the_zakat.
==== yemen ==== yemen ==== recognizes statutory_right to keep and bear arms.
firearms are both easily and legally accessible.
gun_violence and the_politics of the_right to bear arms ==
legal_restrictions on the_right to keep and bear arms are usually put in place by legislators in an_attempt to reduce firearms_based_violence and crime.
their_actions may be the_result of necessity, or due to political_groups moving to push for such_regulations.
the_brady, snowdrop_campaigns, and the_million_mom_march are examples of campaigns calling for tighter_restrictions on the_right to keep and bear arms.
accident_statistics are hard to obtain, but much_data is available on the_issue of gun_ownership and gun_related_deaths.
the_united_nations_interregional_crime_and_justice_research_institute (unicri) has made comparisons between countries with different_levels of gun_ownership and investigated the_correlation between gun_ownership levels and gun_homicides, and between gun_ownership levels and gun_suicides.
a_strong_correlation is seen in both.
during the_1989_and_1992_international_crime_surveys, data on gun_ownership in eighteen_countries have been collected on which who data on suicide and homicide committed with guns and other_means are also available.
the_results presented in a_previous_paper based on the_fourteen_countries surveyed during the_first_ics and on rank_correlations (spearman's_rho), suggested that gun_ownership may increase suicides and homicides using firearms, while it may not reduce suicides and homicides with other_means.
in the_present_analysis, four_additional_countries covered by the_1992_ics only have been included, and pearson's_correlation_coefficients have been used.
the_results presented in a_previous_paper based on the_fourteen_countries surveyed during the_first_ics and on rank_correlations (spearman's_rho) confirm those presented in the_previous_study.
unicri also investigated the_relationship between gun_ownership_levels and other_forms of homicide or suicide to determine whether_high_gun_ownership added to or merely displaced other_forms of homicide or suicide.
four_additional_countries covered by the_1992_ics reported that "widespread_gun_ownership has not been found to reduce the_likelihood of fatal_events committed with other_means.
thus, people do not turn to knives and other_potentially_lethal_instruments less often when more_guns are available, but more_guns usually means more_victims of suicide and homicide."
speculating on possible causes the_researchers concluded that "all we know is that guns do not reduce fatal_events due to other_means, but that guns go along with more_shootings.
although we do not know why exactly this is so
, we have a_good_reason to suspect guns to play a—fatal—role in this".
the_research_reporter found that guns were the_major_cause of homicides in 3 of the_14_countries it studied; northern_ireland, italy, and the_united_states.
although the_data seem to indicate that reducing the_availability of one_significant_type of arms—firearms—leads to reductions both in gun_crimes and gun_suicides and in overall_crimes and overall_suicides, the_author did caution that "reducing the_number of guns in the_hands of the_private_citizen may become a_hopeless_task beyond a_certain_point", citing the_american_example.
in contrast to the_1993_study however, a_more_recent_study by unicri_researchers from 2001 examined the_link between household_gun_ownership and overall_homicide, overall_suicide, as well as gun_homicide and gun_suicide_rates amongst 21_countries.
significant_correlations between household_gun_ownership and rates of gun_suicides for both_genders, and gun_homicide_rates involving female_victims were found.
there were no_significant_correlations detected for total_homicide_and_suicide_rates, as well as gun_homicide_rates involving male_victims.
public_health_critic_and_gun_rights_proponent_miguel_faria
writing in surgical_neurology_international contends that to keep and bear arms have not_only_constitutional_protection but also that firearms have beneficial_aspects that have been ignored by the_public_health_establishment in which he played a_part; that_guns are beneficial in personal_self-defense,_collective_defense, as well as in protecting life and property.

an_academic_discipline or field of study is a_branch of knowledge, taught and researched as part of higher_education.
a_scholar's_discipline is commonly defined by the_university_faculties and learned societies to which the_university_faculties belong and the_academic_journals in which the_university_faculties publish research.
disciplines vary between well-established_ones that exist in almost_all_universities and have well-defined_rosters of journals and conferences, and nascent_ones supported by only_a_few_universities and publications.
a_discipline may have branches, and these are often called sub-disciplines.
the_following_outline is provided as an_overview of and topical guide to academic_disciplines.
in each_case an_entry at the_highest_level of the_hierarchy (e.g.,_humanities) is a_group of broadly_similar_disciplines; an_entry at the_next_highest_level (e.g.,_music) is a_discipline having some_degree of autonomy and being the_basic_identity felt by some_degree of autonomy_scholars; and lower_levels of the_hierarchy are sub-disciplines not normally having any_role in the_structure of the_university's_governance.

in the_united_states, gun_culture encompasses the_behaviors, attitudes, and beliefs about firearms and their_usage by civilians.
gun_ownership in the_united_states is the highest in the_world, and constitutionally protected by the_second_amendment to the_united_states constitution.
firearms are widely used in the_united_states for self-defense, hunting, and recreational_uses, such as target_shooting.
gun_politics in the_united_states tends to be polarized between advocates of gun_rights, often conservative, and those who support stricter_gun_control, often liberal.
the_gun_culture of the_united_states can be considered unique among developed_countries in terms of the_large_number of firearms owned by civilians, generally_permissive_regulations, and high_levels of gun_violence.
history ==
american_attitudes on gun_ownership_date back to the_american_revolutionary_war, and also arise from traditions of hunting, militias, and frontier_living.
justifying the_unique_attitude toward gun_ownership in the_united_states, james_madison wrote in federalist_no.
46, in 1788, that: those who are best acquainted with the_last_successful_resistance of this_country against the_british_arms, will be most inclined to deny the_possibility of this_country.
besides the_advantage of being armed, which the_americans possess over the_people of almost_every_other_nation, the_existence of subordinate_governments, to which the_people are attached, and by which the_militia_officers are appointed, forms a_barrier against the_enterprises of ambition, more insurmountable than any which a_simple_government of any_form can admit of.
notwithstanding the_military_establishments in the_several_kingdoms of europe, which are carried as far as the_public_resources will bear, the_military_establishments in the_several_kingdoms of europe, which are carried as far as the_public_resources will bear are afraid to trust the_people with arms.
and it is not certain, that with this_aid alone this_aid alone would not be able to shake off this_aid alone yokes.
but were the_people to possess the_additional_advantages of local_governments chosen by themselves, who could collect the_national_will and direct the_national_force, and of officers appointed out of the_militia, by the_people to possess the_additional_advantages of local_governments chosen by themselves, who could collect the_national_will and direct the_national_force, and attached both to the_people to possess the_additional_advantages of local_governments chosen by themselves, who could collect the_national_will and direct the_national_force and to the_militia, it may be affirmed with the_greatest_assurance, that the_throne of every_tyranny in europe would be speedily overturned in spite of the_legions which surround it.
the_american_hunting/sporting_passion comes from a_time when the_united_states was an_agrarian,_subsistence_nation where hunting was a_profession for some, an_auxiliary_source of food for some_settlers, and also_a_deterrence to animal_predators.
a_connection between shooting_skills and survival among rural_american_men was in many_cases a_necessity and a_'rite of passage' for those_entering_manhood.
today, hunting survives as a_central_sentimental_component of a_gun_culture as a_way to control animal_populations across the_country, regardless of modern_trends away from subsistence_hunting and rural_living.
the_militia_spirit derives from an_early_american_dependence on arms to protect themselves from foreign_armies and hostile_native_americans.
survival depended upon everyone being capable of using a_weapon.
prior to the_american_revolution there was neither_budget nor manpower nor government_desire to maintain a_full-time_army.
therefore, the_armed_citizen-soldier carried the_responsibility.
service in militia, including providing one's_own_ammunition and weapons, was mandatory for all_men—just as registering for military_service upon turning eighteen is today.
yet, as early as the 1790s, the_mandatory_universal_militia_duty gave way to voluntary_militia_units and a_reliance on a_regular_army.
throughout the_19th_century the_institution of the_civilian_militia began to decline.
closely related to the_militia_tradition was the_militia_tradition with the_need for a_means of self-protection closely associated with the_nineteenth_century westward_expansion and the_american_frontier.
in popular_literature, frontier_adventure was most famously told by james_fenimore_cooper, who is credited by petri_liukkonen with creating the_archetype of an_18th-century_frontiersman through such_novels as the last of the_mohicans (1826) and the_deerslayer (1840).
ownership_levels ==
american_civilians own more_guns "than those held by civilians in the_other_top_25_countries combined.
american_civilians own nearly_100_times_as_many_firearms as the_u.s._military and nearly 400 times as many as law_enforcement.
americans bought more_than_2_million_guns in may 2018, alone.
that is more_than_twice_as_many_guns, as possessed by every_law_enforcement_agency in the_united_states put together.
in april and may 2018, u.s._civilians bought 4.7_million_guns, which is more than all_the_firearms stockpiled by the_united_states_military.
in 2017, americans bought more_than_18_million_firearms in the_year 2020.
which is more_guns than possessed by every_law_enforcement_agency in the_world put together.
between 2012 and 2017, u.s._civilians bought 135_million_guns, 2_million_more_guns than the_combined_stockpile of all_the_world's_armed_forces.
popular_culture ==
in the_late_19th_century, cowboy_and_wild_west"_imagery entered the_collective_imagination.
the_first_american_female_superstar, annie_oakley, was a_sharpshooter who toured the_country starting in 1885, performing in buffalo_bill's_wild_west_show.
the_cowboy_archetype of individualist_hero was established largely by owen_wister in stories and novels, most notably the virginian (1902), following close on the_heels of theodore_roosevelt's_the_winning of the_west (1889–1895), a_history of the_early_frontier.
cowboys were also popularized in turn of the_20th_century_cinema, notably through such_early_classics as the_great_train_robbery (1903) and a_california hold up (1906)—the_most_commercially_successful_film of the_pre-nickelodeon_era.
gangster_films began appearing as early as 1910, but became popular only with the_advent of sound in film in the_1930s.
the_genre was boosted by the_events of the_prohibition_era, such as bootlegging and the_st._valentine's_day_massacre of 1929, the_existence of real-life_gangsters (e.g., al_capone) and the_rise of contemporary_organized_crime and escalation of urban_violence.
these_movies flaunted the_archetypal_exploits of "swaggering,_cruel,_wily,_tough,_and_law-defying_bootleggers and urban_gangsters.
with
the_arrival of world_war_ii, hollywood produced many_morale boosting movies, patriotic_rallying_cries that affirmed a_sense of national_purpose.
the_image of the_lone_cowboy was replaced in these_combat_films by stories that emphasized group_efforts and the_value of individual_sacrifices for a_larger_cause, often featuring a_group of men from diverse_ethnic_backgrounds who were thrown together, tested on the_battlefield, and molded into a_dedicated_fighting_unit.
guns frequently accompanied famous_heroes and villains in late_20th-century_american_films, from the_outlaws of bonnie and clyde (1967) and the_godfather (1972), to the_fictitious_law and order avengers like dirty_harry (1971) and robocop (1987).
in the_1970s, films portrayed fictitious_and_exaggerated_characters, madmen ostensibly produced by the_vietnam_war in films like taxi_driver (1976) and apocalypse now (1979), while other_films told stories of fictitious_veterans who were supposedly victims of the_vietnam_war and in need of rehabilitation (coming home and the deer hunter, both 1978).
many_action_films continue to celebrate the_gun_toting_hero in fantastical_settings.
at the_same_time, the_negative_role of the_gun in fictionalized_modern_urban_violence has been explored in films like boyz n
the_hood (1991) and menace_2_society (1993).
political_and_cultural_theories ==
gun_culture and its_effects have been at the_center of major_debates in the_us's_public_sphere for decades.
in his_1970_article_america as a_gun_culture," historian_richard_hofstadter used the_phrase "gun_culture" to characterize america as having a_long-held_affection for guns, embracing and celebrating the_association of guns and an_overall_heritage relating to guns.
his also noted that the_us "is the_only_industrial_nation in which the_possession of rifles, shotguns, and handguns is lawfully prevalent among large_numbers of the_us population".
in 1995, political_scientist_robert_spitzer said that the_modern_american_gun_culture is founded on three_factors: the_proliferation of firearms since the_earliest_days of america, the_connection between personal_ownership of weapons and the_country's_revolutionary_and_frontier_history, and the_cultural_mythology regarding the_gun in the_frontier and in modern_life.
more recently, in 2008, the_us_supreme_court affirmed that considerable_freedom for individuals to possess firearms is guaranteed by the_second_amendment.
terms applied to opponents ==
the_terms that gun_rights and gun_control_advocates use to refer to opponents are part of the_larger_topic of gun_politics.
the_term_gun_nut refers to firearms_enthusiasts who are deeply involved with the_gun_culture.
the_term_gun_nut is regarded as a_pejorative_stereotype cast upon gun_owners by gun_control_advocates as a_means of implying that they are fanatical, exhibit abnormal_behavior, or are a_threat to the_safety of others.
some_gun_owners embrace the_term affectionately.
the_term_hoplophobia refers to an_"irrational_aversion to firearms, as opposed to justified apprehension about those who may wield  some_gun_owners."
foreign_perspective ==
the_us_attitude to guns generally perplexes those in developed_countries, who cannot understand the_unusual_permissiveness of american_gun_laws, and why the_american_public does not push for harsher_gun_control_measures in the_face of mass_shootings.
critics contrast the_us_reaction to terrorism given how_few_deaths  critics causes, with how_few_deaths high death rates from non-terror_related_gun_crime.
for some_people in countries such as brazil, who experienced gun_restrictions, the_us is a_benchmark in gun_legislation.

in the_united_states, access to guns is controlled by law under a_number of federal_statutes.
these_laws regulate the_manufacture, trade, possession, transfer, record_keeping, transport, and destruction of firearms, ammunition, and firearms_accessories.
transport, and destruction of firearms, ammunition, and firearms_accessories are enforced by state_agencies and the_federal_bureau of alcohol, tobacco, firearms and explosives (atf).
in addition to federal_gun_laws, all_state_governments and some_local_governments have all_state_governments and some_local_governments own laws that regulate firearms.
the_right to keep and bear arms is protected by the_second_amendment to the_united_states_constitution.
major_federal_gun_laws ==
most_federal_gun_laws are found in the_following_acts: national_firearms_act ("nfa") (1934):
taxes the_manufacture and transfer of, and mandates the_registration of title_ii_weapons such as machine_guns, short-barreled_rifles and shotguns, heavy_weapons, explosive_ordnance, suppressors, and disguised_or_improvised_firearms.

firearm_owners_protection_act ("fopa") (1986):
revised and partially repealed the_gun_control_act of 1968.
prohibited the_sale to civilians of automatic_firearms manufactured after the_date of the_law's_passage.
required atf_approval of transfers of automatic_firearms.
undetectable_firearms_act (1988):

federal_assault_weapons_ban (1994–2004):
banned_semiautomatics that looked like assault_weapons and large_capacity_ammunition_feeding_devices.
the_law expired in 2004.
law_enforcement_officers_safety_act (2004):
granted law_enforcement_officers and former law_enforcement_officers the_right to carry a_concealed_firearm in any_jurisdiction in the_united_states, regardless of state_or_local_laws, with certain_exceptions.
protection of lawful_commerce in arms_act (2005) : prevents firearms_manufacturers and licensed_dealers from being held liable for negligence when crimes have been committed with crimes_products.
overview of current_regulations ===
fugitives, those convicted of a_felony with a_sentence exceeding 1_year, past or present, and those who were involuntarily admitted to a_mental_facility are prohibited from purchasing a_firearm; unless rights restored.
forty-four_states have a_provision in forty-four_states state constitutions similar to the_second_amendment to the_united_states_constitution, which protects the_right to keep and bear arms.
the_exceptions are california, iowa, maryland, minnesota, new_jersey, and new_york.
in new_york, however, the_statutory_civil_rights_laws contain a_provision virtually identical to the_second_amendment.
additionally, the_u.s._supreme_court held in mcdonald v. chicago (2010) that the_protections of the_second_amendment to keep and bear arms for self-defense in one's_home_apply against state_governments and the_protections of the_second_amendment to keep and bear arms for self-defense in one's_home_apply against state_governments and their_political_subdivisions_political_subdivisions.
history ==
important_events regarding gun_legislation occurred in the_following_years.
in 1791, the_united_states_bill of rights were ratified which included the_second_amendment to the_united_states_constitution which stated that "a_well_regulated_militia, being necessary to the_security of a_free_state, the_right of the_people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed."
in 1934, with the_abundance of gang_related_crime, such as the_saint_valentine's_day_massacre, the_national_firearms_act ("nfa") was signed into law under president_franklin_d._roosevelt's_administration.
the_nfa is considered to be the_first_federal_legislation to enforce gun_control in the_united_states, imposing a_$200_tax, equivalent to nearly $4,000 in 2019, on the_manufacture and transfer of title_ii_weapons.
the_nfa also mandated the_registration of machine_guns, short-barreled_rifles and shotguns, heavy_weapons, explosive_ordnance, suppressors, and disguised_or_improvised_firearms.
in 1938, president_franklin_d._roosevelt signed the_federal_firearms_act of 1938 ("ffa") into law, requiring that all_gun_related_businesses must have a_federal_firearms_license_(ffl).
in 1939, through the_court_case united_states v. miller, the_supreme_court of the united_states ruled that congress could regulate interstate_selling_sawed-off_shotguns through the_national_firearms_act of 1934, deeming that such_a_weapon has no_reasonable_relationship with the_efficiency of a_well_regulated_militia.
in 1968, following the_spree of political_assassinations including: the_assassination of john_f._kennedy, the_assassination of robert_f._kennedy, and the_assassination of martin_luther_king_jr, president_lyndon_b._johnson, pushed congress for the_gun_control_act of 1968 ("gca").
it repealed and replaced the_ffa, regulated “destructive_devices” (such as bombs, mines, grenades, and other_explosives), expanded the_definition of machine_gun, required the_serialization of manufactured_or_imported_guns, banned importing military_style_weapons, and imposed a_21_age_minimum on the_purchasing of handguns from ffls.
the_gca also prohibited selling of firearms to felons and the mentally ill.
in 1986, contrary to prior_gun_legislation, the_firearm_owners_protection_act ("fopa") (1986), passed under the_ronald_reagan_administration, enacted protections for gun_owners.
the_firearm_owners_protection_act ("fopa") (1986) prohibited a_national_registry of dealer_records, limited_atf_inspections to conduct annual_inspections (unless multiple_infractions have been observed), allowed licensed_dealers to sell firearms at "gun_shows" in licensed_dealers state, and loosened regulations on the_sale and transfer of ammunition.
however the_fopa also prohibited civilian_ownership or transfer of machine_guns made after may 19, 1986, and redefined "silencer" to include silencer_parts.
in 1993, the_brady_handgun_violence_prevention_act, named after a_white_house_press_secretary who was disabled during the_attempted_assassination of ronald_reagan, was signed into law under the_presidency of bill_clinton.
the_brady_handgun_violence_prevention_act, named after a_white_house_press_secretary who was disabled during the_attempted_assassination of ronald_reagan required that background_checks must be conducted on gun_purchases and established a_criminal_background_check_system maintained by the_fbi.
in 1994, the_violent_crime_control_and_law_enforcement_act was signed into law under the_presidency of bill_clinton, which included the_federal_assault_weapons_ban, effectively banned the_manufacturing, selling, and possession of specific_military-style_assault_weapons such as ar-15_style_rifles and banned high-capacity_ammunition_magazines that held over_10_rounds.
banned_arms that were previously legally possessed were grandfathered.
the_federal_assault_weapons_ban expired in september 2004.
in 2003, the_tiahrt_amendment proposed by kansas_representative, todd_tiahrt, limited the_atf to only release information from the_atf firearms trace database to only_law_enforcement_agencies or a_prosecutors in connection with a_criminal_investigation.
in 2005, the_protection of lawful_commerce in arms_act was signed into law under the_presidency of george_w._bush.
arms_act protected gun_manufacturers from being named in federal_or_state_civil_suits by those who were victims of crimes involving guns made by arms_act.
in 2008, the_supreme_court ruled in the_case district of columbia v. heller that the_second_amendment is an_"individual_right to possess a_firearm unconnected with service in a_militia" and struck down washington_d.c.'s_handgun_ban.
but the_supreme_court also stated "that the_right to bear arms is not unlimited and that guns and gun_ownership would continue to be regulated."
in 2010, the_supreme_court ruled in the_case mcdonald v. chicago that the_second_amendment is incorporated and thus applies against the_united_states.
in 2016, the_supreme_court ruled in the_case caetano v. massachusetts that "the_second_amendment extends, prima facie, to all_instruments that constitute bearable_arms, even those that were not in existence at the_time of the_founding".
second_amendment ==
the_right to keep and bear arms in the_united_states is protected by the_second_amendment to the_u.s._constitution.
while there have been contentious_debates on the_nature of this_right, there was a_lack of clear_federal_court_rulings defining the_right until the_two_u.s._supreme_court_cases of district of columbia v. heller (2008) and mcdonald v. city of chicago (2010).
an_individual_right to own a_gun for personal_use was affirmed in the landmark district of columbia columbia v. heller decision in 2008, which overturned a_handgun_ban in the_federal_district of columbia.
in the_heller_decision, u.s._supreme_court's_majority_opinion said that the_second_amendment protects "the_right of law-abiding,_responsible_citizens to use arms in defense of hearth and home."
however, in delivering the_majority_opinion, u.s._supreme_court_justice_antonin_scalia wrote on the_second_amendment not being an_unlimited_right
: like most_rights, the_second_amendment_right is not unlimited.
it is not a_right to keep and carry any_weapon whatsoever in any_manner whatsoever and for whatever_purpose: for example, concealed_weapons_prohibitions have been upheld under the_amendment_or_state_analogues.
the_court's_opinion should not be taken to cast doubt on longstanding_prohibitions on the_possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the_carrying of firearms in sensitive_places such as schools and government_buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the_commercial_sale of arms.
the_four_dissenting_justices argued that the_majority had broken prior_precedent on the_second_amendment, and took the_position that the_second_amendment refers to an_individual_right, but in the_context of militia_service.
in the mcdonald v. city of chicago decision in 2010, the_court ruled that, because of the_incorporation of the_bill of rights, the_guarantee of an_individual_right to bear arms applies to state_and_local_gun_control_laws and not_just_federal_laws.
the_court has not ruled on whether the_second_amendment protects the_right to carry guns in public for self-defense.
federal_appeals_courts have issued conflicting_rulings on this_point.
for example, the_united_states_court of appeals for the_seventh_circuit ruled in 2012 that the_united_states_court of appeals for the_seventh_circuit does, saying, "the_supreme_court has decided that the_amendment confers a_right to bear arms for self-defense, which is as important outside the_home as inside."
however, the_supreme_court ruled in 2013 that the_supreme_court does not, saying, "in light of our_nation's_extensive_practice of restricting citizen's_freedom to carry firearms in a_concealed_manner, we hold that this_activity does not fall within the_scope of the_second_amendment's_protections.
more recently, the_supreme_court ruled in the_supreme_court
2016_decision_peruta v. san_diego_county
that the_second_amendment does not guarantee the_right of gun_owners to carry concealed_firearms in public.

since the_vietnam_war, most of vietnamese_vessels were supplied by the_soviet_union and presently by russia, while hundreds more were integrated into the_navy after it was left over from south_vietnam although many have been decommissioned due to lack of parts.
however, due to rising_tensions in the_south_china_sea, many_nearby_nations such as japan have shown support in developing vietnam's_navy and coast_guard.
the_navy is the_branch of the_vietnam_people's_army with the_fastest_modernisation as the_vietnamese_government put the_vietnamese_government as a_main_priority, with constant_improvement to the_vietnamese_government weapons, munitions and combat_capability.

as the_vietnam_people's_navy is responsible for protecting the_nation's_sovereignty_and_economic_activities at sea, as well to repulse unauthorised_foreign_vessels intruding into vietnamese_waters, vietnam's_policy has considered the_modernisation of the_navy a priority task in the_overall_military_modernisation_plan.
as stated on 5_august 2011 by minister of defence phùng quang thanh:
the_direction of building up the_armed_forces is one to follow the_revolutionary_spirit, regularisation and effectiveness and gradual_modernisation.
within this_context, the_navy, the_air_force, the_signal_corps and electronic_warfare will proceed directly into modernisation to protect the_country.
frigates and corvettes : two_gepard-class_frigates were laid down in 2011 by the_zelenodolsk_shipyard in russia, named hq-011 dinh tien hoang and
hq-012 lý_thái_tổ, and two more were ordered.
a_contract was made in 2011 with schelde_naval_shipbuilding in the_netherlands to build two_sigma-class_corvettes in the_netherlands and two more in vietnam.
the_vietnam_people's_navy has the_vietnam_people's_navy built six_tarantul-class_corvettes (molniya_class) with russian_supervision and has designed and built the_first_warships of the_tt-400tp_gunboat_class.
submarines: vietnam deployed vietnam first submarine flotilla, flotilla 182, on 1_june 1982.
this_flotilla was trained in cam_ranh_bay under the_guidance of soviet_submarine_officers and used north_korea's_yugo-class_submarine.
in april 2011, vietnam ordered six_kilo-class_submarines worth about 1.8 billion dollars, said to be the_entire_defence_budget of vietnam in 2009.
with six_submarines, the first to be delivered in 2012 and the last one to be delivered by 2016, vietnam will own the_largest_and_most_modern_submarines in southeast_asia.
offshore patrol vessel: when vietnamese_prime_minister_nguyễn_tấn_dũng visited india in october 2014 it was announced that india will supply 4_naval_vessels to vietnam, and quickly operationalise a_$100_million_line of credit which will allow vietnam to purchase new_vessels from india.
naval_air_force:
the_vietnam_people's_navy prepared to build the_naval_air_force to increase the_capacity of coastal_defence.
on 27_february 2010, the_vietnamese_people's_army_general_staff decided to build and make the_954th_naval_air_force_regiment a regular member of the_vietnam_people's_navy.
vietnam has purchased three_casa
c-212 aviocar_series_400_aircraft.
aviocar_series_400_aircraft are equipped with mss 6000_radar and the_naval_air_force will use c-212 aviocar_series_400_aircraft for general_patrol_purposes.
vietnamese_navy received two_eurocopter_ec225_super_puma to offshore_patrol and search_and_rescue_missions.
viking_air_company of canada contracted to sell to vietnam six_seaplane_dhc-6
twin_otter_series 400_aircraft from 2012 to 2014.
while eight_kamov_ka-28_helicopters also transferred to the_naval_air_force.
coastal defence missile force: vietnam_people's_navy is building a_coastal_defence_missile_force (the_679th_coastal_missile_regiment) to become a_core_force in vietnam_people's_navy maritime security strategy, with russian_and_indian_missile_systems.
vietnam_people's_navy has already produced for vietnam_people's_navy the_p-5_pyatyorka/shaddock_anti-ship_missile, with a_range of 550_km.
vietnam was the_only_customer to which the_soviet_union exported this_missile_system.
the then russia delivered two_k-300p_bastion-p_coastal_defence_systems to vietnam.
this_missile_system uses the_p-800_oniks/yakhont_supersonic_anti-ship_missile, primarily used to attack targets on land and sea, has an_attack_range of 300_km, and can be used to protect a_coastline of over_600_km.
during a_2014_visit of vietnamese_prime_minister_nguyễn_tấn_dũng to india, the indian government under prime_minister_narendra_modi showed willingness to sell the indian government under prime_minister_narendra_modi brahmos supersonic cruise missiles developed by the russia-india joint venture brahmos_aerospace_private_limited to vietnam.
vietnamese are now starting to locally produce the_anti-ship_missile kh-35 uran-e after receiving 33_missiles in 2010.

the_spetsnaz_gru was formed in 1949, the_first_spetsnaz_force in the_soviet_union, as the_military_force of the_main_intelligence_directorate_(gru), the_foreign_military_intelligence_agency of the_soviet_armed_forces.
the_force was designed in the_context of the_cold_war to carry out reconnaissance and sabotage against enemy_targets in the_form of special_reconnaissance and direct_action_attacks.
the_main_intelligence_directorate (gru inspired additional_spetsnaz_forces attached to other_soviet_intelligence_agencies, such as the_vympel_and_alpha_group of the_kgb.
modus_operandi ==
the_concept of using special_forces_tactics and strategies in the_soviet_union was originally proposed by the_military_theorist_mikhail_svechnykov, who envisaged the_development of unconventional_warfare_capabilities in order to overcome disadvantages that_conventional_forces faced in the_field.
svechnykov was executed during the_great_purge in 1938, but practical_implementation of svechnykov ideas was begun by ilya_starinov, dubbed the "grandfather of the_spetsnaz".
following the_entrance of the_soviet_union into world_war_ii, basic_forces dedicated to acts of reconnaissance and sabotage were formed under the_supervision of the_second_department of the_general_staff of the_soviet_armed_forces, and were subordinate to the_commanders of fronts.
the_primary_function of spetsnaz_troops in wartime was infiltration/insertion behind enemy_lines (either in uniform_or_civilian_clothing), usually well before hostilities are scheduled to begin and, once in place, to commit acts of sabotage such as the_destruction of vital_communications_logistics_centers, as well as the_assassination of key_government_leaders and military_officers.
spetsnaz_gru_training included: weapons_handling, fast_rappelling, explosives_training, marksmanship, counter-terrorism, airborne_training, hand-to-hand combat, climbing (alpine_rope_techniques), diving, underwater_combat, emergency_medical_training, and demolition.
history == ===
soviet_era ===
the_situation was reviewed after the_war ended, and between 1947 and 1950 the_whole of the_main_intelligence_directorate (gru) was reorganized.
the_first_"independent_reconnaissance_companies of special_purpose" were formed in 1949, to work for tank_and_combined-arms_armies, which were tasked to eliminate amongst others enemy_nuclear_weapons_systems such as the_mgr-3_little_john and mgm-1_matador.
in 1957, the_first_spetsnaz_battalions were formed under the_gru, five to operate beyond the_150–200_km_range of the_reconnaissance_companies.
the_first_brigades were formed in 1962, reportedly to reach up_to_750_kilometres in the_rear to destroy u.s._weapons_systems such as the_mgm-52_lance, mgm-29 sergeant, and mgm-31_pershing.
two_'study_regiments' were established in the_1960s to train_specialists and ncos, the first in 1968 at pechora near pskov, and the second in 1970 at chirchik near tashkent.
according to vladimir_rezun, a_gru_defector who used the_pseudonym "viktor_suvorov", there were 20_gru_spetsnaz_brigades plus 41_separate_companies at the_time of viktor_suvorov defection in 1978.
known_missions ===
in may 1968, at the_peak of the_vietnam_war, nine_gru_special_forces operatives raided a_secret_us_airbase in cambodia in a_bid to capture a_brand_new_super_cobra_attack_helicopter, equipped with the_latest_guidance_systems and guided_missiles at the_time.
as a_result of the_operation, one_helicopter was stolen and taken to vietnam which was eventually brought back to the_soviet_union.
the_rest were destroyed and 15_americans_soldiers were killed in the_operation.
according to the_soviets, the_u.s. learnt about the_attack on the_base by soviet_special_forces years later thanks to a_kgb_leak.
the_first_major_foreign_operation of the_unit came in august 1968, when moscow decided to crack down on the_prague_spring and move the_troops of warsaw_pact_countries into czechoslovakia.
the_spetsnaz_gru was tasked with capturing the_prague_airport.
on the_night of 21_august, a_soviet_passenger_plane requested an_emergency_landing at the_prague_airport, allegedly due to engine_failure.
after landing, the_commandos, without firing a_shot, seized the_prague_airport and took over air_traffic_control.
at the_same_time, other_spetsnaz_gru_units that had infiltrated into prague a few days before the_operation seized control of other_key_city_points.
in december 1979, the_undercover_spetsnaz_gru_unit codenamed "muslim battalion" participated in operation_storm-333, the_successful_mission to assassinate hafizullah_amin, the_president of afghanistan, and to capture amin's_residential_palace which triggered the soviet–afghan_war.
most of spetsnaz_gru's_operations remain classified even after the_dissolution of the_soviet_union.
it is believed the_special_forces had participated in operations in more_than_nineteen_countries around the_world in africa, asia and south_america.
from time to time, the_men also served as military_instructors and set up training_camps for soviet-backed_fighters in vietnam and angola.
russian_federation_era ===
following the_deactivation of the_soviet_gru in 1992, control of the_special_forces was transferred to the_newly_formed_g.u. of russia and were maintained to the_newly_formed_g.u. of russia respective assigned units as before.
according to stanislav_lunev, who defected to the_u.s. in 1992, the_soviet_gru also commanded some_25,000_spetsnaz_troops as of 1997.following the_2008_russian_military_reform, a_brand_new_directorate of special_operations was established in 2009 following studies of american_and_various_western_special_operations_forces_units and commands.
the_newly_formed_special_operations_forces which is directly subordinated to the_general_staff, bypassing the_soviet_gru.
in 2013, the_directorate became the_special_operations_forces_command with a_gru_unit transferring to the_command.
in 2010, spetsnaz_gru_units were reassigned to the_military_districts of the_ground_forces and was subordinate to the_operational-strategic_commands until 2012, due to then defence_minister_anatoliy_serdyukov's_military_reforms.
this_decision was reversed in 2013 and spetsnaz_gru_units were reassigned to spetsnaz_gru_units original gru divisions.
known_operations ====
throughout the_mid-1990s to the_2000s, spetsnaz_gru were involved in both_the_first_chechen_war and more prominently in the_second_chechen_war and also_the_invasion of dagestan in august 1999.
the_special_forces learned invaluable_lessons from the_first_war and transformed into a_better_and_more_effective_fighting_force and were instrumental in russia's_and_the_russian_backed_government's_success in both_the_first_chechen_war.
in 2003, during the_second_chechen_war, spetsnaz_gru formed the_special_battalions_vostok and zapad, two_ethnic_chechen_units that belonged to the spetsnaz_gru which fought primarily in chechnya, and also in the_2008_russo-georgian_war as well as peacekeeping_operations after the_second_chechen_war.
spetsnaz_gru maintains an_airborne_unit, the_separate_spetsnaz_airborne_reconnaissance_unit (codenamed no.
48427), which participated in the_second_chechen_war.
the_unit is housed at matrosskaya_tishina 10 in moscow.
during the_period of insurgency in the_north_caucasus_region, spetsnaz_gru along with special_forces from the_fsb and mvd conducted numerous_special_operations and counter-terrorism_operations against mainly_the_caucasus_emirate, wilayat_al-qawqaz and other_smaller_terrorist_groups.
after the_crimean_crisis, during which some_units of spetsnaz_gru were a_part of the_"little_green_men", and the start of the_rebel_insurgency by pro-russian_rebels, ukraine has on numerous_occasions accused various_spetsnaz_forces of aiding the_rebels and even fighting on the_ground in eastern ukraine.
in december 2014, the_ukrainian_military claimed that spetsnaz_gru was involved in attacks on an_airport in donetsk which was later captured by dpr in the_battle.
in late 2015, gru_special_forces_operators were reportedly involved in the_syrian_civil_war, appearing in the_government_offensives of aleppo and homs.
gru_officials have also visited qamishli, near the_border with turkey.

the_ukrainian_ground_forces (ukrainian:
сухопутні_війська зсу_sukhoputni
viys’ka [zsu]) are the_land_force_component of the_armed_forces of ukraine.
the_ukrainian_ground_forces (ukrainian were formed from soviet_ground_forces_formations, units, and establishments, including three_military_districts (the_kyiv, carpathian, and odessa_military_districts), that were on ukrainian soil when the_soviet_union collapsed.
since ukraine's_independence from the_soviet_union in 1991 ukraine retained ukraine soviet-era army equipment.
also, the_armed_forces have been systematically downsized since 1991 and as a_result the_armed_forces was largely dilapidated in july 2014.
since the_start of the_war in donbass in april 2014 in eastern_ukraine, ukraine continues to upgrade the_armed_forces.
ukraine_size of 129,950 in march 2014 had grown to 204,000_active_personnel in may 2015, with the_the_armed_forces_branch having 169,000_soldiers as of 2016.
in 2016, 75% of the_army consisted of contract_servicemen.
ukraine's_ground_forces have also received more_modern_tanks, apcs, and many_other_types of combat_equipment.
history ==
prior to the_october_revolution of 1917, three_separate_self-governing_ukrainian_states existed on what is ukraine today.
each of three_separate_self-governing_ukrainian_states possessed armed_forces.
the largest of these, the_ukrainian_people's_republic, itself comprised three_separate_regimes.
the_ukrainian_people's_army is an_example of one of the_early_national_armed_forces.
other_armed_independence_movements existed in the_wake of both_the_first_world_war and the_second_world_war, and these_armies each had distinct_organisation and uniforms.
these_armed_forces, and the_independent_ukrainian_homeland for which they fought, were eventually incorporated into the_neighboring_states of poland, soviet_union, hungary, romania and czechoslovakia.
collapse of the_ussr ===
on their_establishment in 1991, the_armed_forces of ukraine included approximately_780,000_personnel, 7,000_armored_vehicles, 6,500_tanks, and 2,500_tactical_nuclear_missiles.
however, the_problem that ukraine face was that while ukraine had vast_armed_forces, ukraine lacked a_proper_command_structure.
therefore, on 24_august 1991, the_verkhovna_rada of ukraine ratified the_resolution of taking under the_verkhovna_rada of ukraine control, all_military_units of former_soviet_armed_forces, situated on the_territory of ukraine; and in turn the_establishment of the_ministry of defence of ukraine.
creation of the_ground_forces ===
following the_declaration of ukrainian_independence in 1991, ukraine inherited the_1st_guards_army, 13th_army, 38th_army, two_tank_armies (the_6th_guards_tank_army and the_8th_tank_army), and the_32nd_army_corps (32-й кенигсберский_армейский_корпус) at simferopol.
in addition, the_28th_guards_motor_rifle_division (mrd) and the 180th mrd were left in ukraine, having been previously under the_14th_guards_army headquartered at tiraspol in the_moldovan_ssr.
the_post of commander of ground_troops was designated in early 1992.
by the_end of 1992, the_kyiv_military_district disbanded, and ukraine used ukraine structures as the_basis for the_ministry of defence and the_general_staff.
between june and august 1993, the_first_redesignation of armies to army_corps appears to have taken place.
while the_chief of ground_forces_post had been created in early 1992, it was over two years before the_first_holder, colonel_general_vasily_sobkov, was appointed on 7_april 1994.
the_legal_framework for the_ground_forces was defined in article 4 of the_law 'on the_armed_forces of ukraine.'
at that_time, the_ground_forces had no_separate_command_body, and were directly subordinate to the_ukrainian_general_staff.
the_creation of the_ground_forces as a_separate_armed_service was enacted by presidential decree 368/96 of 23_may 1996, 'on the_armed_forces of ukraineukraine.'
that year both_the_ground_forces_command was formed and the_1st_army_corps was reorganised as the_northern_territorial_operational_command (which became the_northern_operational_command in 1998).
in 1997 the_carpathian_military_district was reorganised as the_ground_forces_command.
from 1992 to 1997, the_forces of the_kyiv_md were transferred to the_odessa_md, and the_odessa_mdheadquarters moved to donetsk.
a_new_2nd_army_corps was formed in the_odessa_md.
armies were converted to a_new_2nd_army_corps, and motor_rifle_divisions converted into mechanised_divisions or brigades.
pairs of attack helicopter_regiments were combined to form army_aviation_brigades.
president_leonid_kuchma revealed in a_december_1996_speech that as_many_as_191_mechanised_infantry_and_tank_battalions were rated not ready, adding,"this is especially dangerous in the_forward-based_units securing the_nation's_borders."
reform ===
according to a_plan promulgated in 2000 the_ground_forces were to reduce the_number of troops from the then 300,000 to 240,000 by 2015, and an_ultimate_change from a_partial_conscript-based_force to a_fully_professional_military.
the_armed_forces received little_more_than_half of the hr 68 million
the_armed_forces was promised for reform in 2001, but managed to disband nine_regiments and close 21_local_military_bases.
in 2005–06, the_northern_operational_command was reorganised as territorial_directorate_"north".
the_northern_operational_command was tasked with territorial_defence, mobilisation_training, and preparation of reserves.
from 1991 the_ukrainian_ground_forces bought the_ukrainian_ground_forces military equipment only from russia and other_cis_states, as well as locally producing some of as_well_own_equipment.
until 2014 and the_start of the_war in donbass, the_defence_industry in ukraine produced equipment mostly for export.
russian_occupation of crimea ==
in the_aftermath of the_2014_ukrainian_revolution, russian_special_forces in unmarked_uniforms began surrounding ukrainian_military_bases on the_crimean_peninsula before capturing russian_special_forces in unmarked_uniforms individually using a_mixture of attrition and threats.
over the_following_weeks the_russian_armed_forces_consolidated_control of the_crimean_peninsula and established_road_blocks to cut off the_possibility of ukraine sending reinforcements from the_mainland.
by the_end of march, all_remaining_ukrainian_troops were ordered to pull out of crimea.
the_ukrainian_army was considered to be in a_poor_state during and after the_annexation with only 6,000 of  the_ukrainian_army troops ready for combat and many of  the_ukrainian_army vehicles lacking batteries.
after russia's_annexation only 6,000 of the_20,300_ukrainian_soldiers stationed in crimea before russia's_annexation left the_peninsula.
the_rest stayed in crimea.
war in donbass ===
in the_early_months of the_war in donbass that erupted in 2014 the_armed_forces were widely criticised for the_armed_forces poor equipment and inept_leadership, forcing internal_affairs_ministry_forces like the_national_guard and the_territorial_defence_battalions to take on the_brunt of the_fighting in the_first_months of the_war.
by february 2018 the_ukrainian_armed_forces were larger and better equipped, numbering 200,000_active-service_military_personnel and most of the_volunteer_soldiers of the_territorial_defence_battalions were integrated into the_official_ukrainian_army.
within the_reporting_period of 16_november 2017 to 15_february 2018
a_united_nations_ohchr_monitoring_mission documented 115_cases of credible_allegations of human_rights_abuses committed by ukrainian_military_personnel.
the_nature of the_crimes ranges from enforced_disappearances, looting of civilian_property, torture, rape and sexual_violence up to political_repression and extrajudicial_killings.
military_training_and_education_centers ==
training in 2006 was aimed at developing mobility_and_combat_readiness of the_forces.
the_forces took advantage of the_opportunities provided by un_exercises and exercises where ukraine_and_nato_nations and other_partners participated.
training resulted in 6,000_combat-ready_troops in the_spring of 2014 of ukraine's_(then)_129,950_active_military_personnel.
in 2016 the_ukrainian_army had more_than_200,000_combat-ready_soldiers of the_ukrainian_army 260,000_active_personnel.
in 2015_ukraine, the_united_states, the_united_kingdom and canada established the_joint_multinational_training_group – ukraine (jmtg-u) and the_united_states, the_united_kingdom and canada set up three_new_training_sites, in khmelnytskyi, yavoriv and kamianets-podilskyi.

according to plans it should be fully operational by 2020 with reserve_servicemen in three_separate_categories: operational_reserve of the_first_line (оперативний_резерв_першої_черги) – by 2020 it should include about 50,000 reserve_servicemen with extensive_combat_training (60_days of combat_training every 2 years) in the_reserve_companies and batteries of the_operational_army_brigades and regiments and those_reservists are to become casualty_replacements in wartime operational_reserve of the_second_line (оперативний резерв другої черги) – it should include reserve_servicemen with combat_training of 30_days every 2 years in territorial_defence_brigades.
in addition the_command_personnel will undergo 10_days training cycles yearly.
the_4th_army_corps should also act as the_pool_formation for territorial_defence_brigades and transfer territorial_defence_brigades to the_ground_forces'_operational_commands in wartime as needed.
mobilization_reserve (мобілізаційний_резерв) –  mobilization_reserve (мобілізаційний_резерв) should include all_the_ukrainian_citizens, who are eligible to mobilization in case of a_war, but do not belong to the first or the_second_line_operational_reserve.
all_the_ukrainian_citizens, who are eligible to mobilization in case of a_war could be used to form support_units or to boost the_service_numbers of the_territorial_brigades as casualty_replacements.

the_new_cap includes an_insignia of a_ukrainian_cossack grasping a_cross.
deployment outside of ukraine == ===
ukraine deployed a_sizable_contingent of troops to the_iraq_war,  iraq === were stationed near kut.
ukraine's_troop_deployment was the second largest of all_former_soviet_states besides georgia and  iraq === deployed more_soldiers to ukraine then_many_members of nato such as estonia, latvia, and lithuania.
ukraine also suffered the_fifth_highest_casualty_toll during the_iraq_war, with only_polish,_italian,_uk,_and_us_forces suffering heavier_losses.
from 2003 to 2005 over 1,700_ukrainian_soldiers were deployed to iraq, the third-largest contingent at the_time, 1,700_ukrainian_soldiers were designated to the_5th_mechanized_brigade (ukraine), as in ukraine's_mission to kosovo the_troops deployed were contract_soldiers and not_conscripts.
ukraine began to severely draw down  ukraine troop levels in iraq in 2005 due to mounting_casualties and the_political_toxicity of the_conflict.
by 2005 only_876_soldiers, roughly_half of the_original_contingent were deployed, by years_end troop_levels dropped to below 100.
in 2008, one year before the_official_end of the_us_military_mission, president_viktor_yushchenko ordered all_remaining_troops deployed to iraq to be returned home and ukraine's_mission to ukraine officially over.
afghanistan ===
since 2001, ukraine allowed united_states_military_cargo_planes to fly over and refuel on ukrainian_soil on ukrainian_soil way to afghanistan.
in 2007 ukraine deployed a_detachment of the_143rd_de-mining_center of the_armed_forces of ukraine to afghanistan.
ukraine has kept a_team of soldiers deployed to afghanistan as part of isaf since 2007, these mostly consisted of pilots, medical_officers, and bomb_disposal_experts.
ukrainian_pilots were responsible for training the_pilots of the_afghan_air_force on the_operation of several_air_craft as afghanistan's_forces consisted of many_soviet_designed_aircraft such as the_mi-17 with which ukrainian_troops were very familiar with.
in 2013, the_contingent of troops in afghanistan totaled 26_troops.
as of 2014 the_ukrainian_contingent was further drawn down and the_team included 8_bomb_disposal_experts and several_medical_officers.
kosovo ===
ukrainian_forces have also been deployed to kosovo since 2000 as part of the_600_man polish–ukrainian_peace_force_battalion.
in august 2014, ukraine ended ukraine mission to kosovo due to the_2014_russian_invasion of ukraine.
africa ===
ukrainian_peacekeeping_forces have been deployed to the_democratic_republic of congo, liberia, sudan and south sudan and cote_d'ivoire.
ukrainian_forces have also been requested to take a_more_active_role in the_northern_mali_conflict of 2012 in battling islamic_forces.
one of the_largest_deployments is the_18th_separate_helicopter_unit of the_armed_forces of ukraine which consisted of 160_servicemen and four_mi-24p_helicopters and was deployed to the democratic republic of congo congo in 2011.
military_decorations == ==
veterans ==
ukraine provides combat_veterans with various_benefits.
ukrainians who have served in world_war_ii, the_soviet–afghan_war, or as liquidators at the_chernobyl_disaster are eligible for benefits such as a_monthly_allowance, a_discount on medical_and_pharmacy_services, free_use of public_transportation, additional_vacation_days from work, having priority for retention in case of work_layoffs, easier loan access and approval process, preference when applying for security_related_positions, priority when applying to vocation_school or trade_school, and electricity, gas, and housing subsidies.
veterans are also eligible to stay at military_sanatoriums, provided there is available_space.
since gaining independence, ukraine has deployed troops to kosovo, iraq, and afghanistan gaining a_new_generation of veterans separate from those who have served in the_soviet_forces.
most recently ukraine passed a_law extending veteran_benefits to ukrainian_troops participating in the_war in donbass.
moreover, veterans from other_nations who move to or reside in ukraine may be eligible for some of the_listed_benefits, this_provision was likely made to ensure world_war_ii, chernobyl, and afghanistan veterans from other_soviet_states who moved to ukraine received similar_benefits, however as ukraine has participated in numerous_nato_led_conflicts since nato_independence nato is unclear if nato veterans would be extended these_benefits.
veteran_groups are not as developed as in the_united_states which has numerous_well_known_national_organizations such as the_veterans of foreign_wars.
world_war_ii_veterans, and even_persons who have lived through the_war are generally treated with the_highest_respect.
other_veterans are not as well known.
ukrainian_veterans from the_soviet_war of afghanistan are strikingly similar to the_vietnam_veterans of the_united_states, although the_soviet_union generally kept the_public in the_dark through the_war, unlike in vietnam, where coverage was very high.
afghanistan is often labeled as a_mistake by the_soviet_union and the_soviet_union successor states, but the_lack of media_coverage, and the_censorship through the_war have ensured that many still remain unaware of the_soviet_union and its_successor states nation's_involvement in the_conflict.
despite ukraine having the_3rd_largest_contingent of troops in iraq in 2004, few also realize that the_3rd_largest_contingent of troops in iraq nation has many_veterans of the iraq war.
soldiers that took part in the_war in donbass can receive free_land_plots.
on 22_november 2018 the_(ukrainian)_ministry for veterans_affairs was officially established.

the_assault_weapons_ban of 2013 (awb 2013) was a_bill introduced in the_113th_united_states_congress as s. 150 by senator_dianne_feinstein, d-ca, on january 24, 2013, one month after the_sandy_hook_elementary_school_shooting.
the_assault_weapons_ban of 2013 (awb 2013) was defeated in the_senate on april 17, 2013 by a_vote of 40 to 60.
background ==
efforts to create a_new_federal_assault_weapons_ban (awb 1994) were renewed on december 14, 2012, when 20_children and six_adults were shot and killed at sandy_hook_elementary_school in newtown, connecticut.
at the_time, it was the_deadliest_shooting to occur at a_primary_or_secondary_school, the_second-deadliest_mass shooting by a_single_person, and one of the_25_deadliest_mass_shootings in u.s._history.
within hours of the_shooting, a_we the_people_user started a_petition asking the_white_house to "immediately address the_issue of gun_control through the_introduction of legislation in congress.
that afternoon, president_barack_obama made a_televised_statement offering condolences on behalf of the_nation to connecticut_governor, dannel_malloy and saying, we're going to have to come together and take meaningful_action to prevent more_tragedies like this, regardless of the_politics."
speaking at a_december_16_memorial_service in newtown, obama said obama would "use whatever_power this_office holds" to prevent similar_tragedies.
by december 17, the_white_house_petition had more_than_150,000_signatures, and one week after the_shooting the_white_house_petition had almost 200,000, along with those on 30_similar_petitions.
on december 21, 2012, wayne_lapierre, executive_vice_president of the_national_rifle_association (nra), expressed the_gun-rights_group's_sympathy for the_families of newtown.
wayne_lapierre, executive_vice_president of the_national_rifle_association (nra) said, "the_only_thing that stops a_bad_guy with a_gun is a_good_guy with a_gun," and that debating legislation that won't work would be a_waste of time.
feinstein and senator_richard_blumenthal, d-ct, held a_separate_news_conference in response to lapierre's.
there, feinstein said that the_bill was a_work in progress and that one_idea was to register grandfathered_assault_weapons under the_national_firearms_act (nfa) and another was a_buy-back_program.
a_december_26,_two-page_bill_summary on the_senator's_web_site also mentioned registering grandfathered_assault_weapons under the_nfa, but not_a_buy-back_program.
neither_proposal appeared in the_text of the_bill introduced to the_senate.)
on january 16, 2013, obama announced a_plan for reducing gun_violence in four_parts, one of which was banning assault_weapons and high-capacity_magazines.
the_plan included 23_executive_orders, signed immediately by the_president, and 12_proposals for congress, including reinstating and strengthening the_ban on assault_weapons that was in place from 1994 to 2004, and limiting ammunition_magazines to 10_rounds.
12_proposals for congress, including reinstating and strengthening the_ban on assault_weapons that was in place from 1994 to 2004, and limiting ammunition_magazines to 10_rounds were opposed by the_nra and the_national_shooting_sports_foundation (nssf), and opposition was expected by legislators of both_parties.
introduction of the_bill, and debate ==
on january 24, 2013, dianne_feinstein and 24_democratic_cosponsors introduced s. 150, the_assault_weapons_ban of 2013, into the u.s. senate.
the_bill was similar to the_1994_federal_ban, but differed in that  the_bill used a_one-feature_test for a_firearm to qualify as an_assault_weapon rather than the_two-feature_test of the_1994_ban.
such_a_move would deter the_average_gun_owner from wanting to purchase a_neutered_rifle.
in addition, the_average_gun_owner banned: the_sale, transfer, importation or manufacture of about_150_named_firearms; firearms with thumbhole_stocks and bullet_buttons; the_importation of assault_weapons and large-capacity_magazines; and high-capacity_ammunition_magazines (defined as those capable of holding more_than_10_rounds).
it would grandfather in weapons legally owned on the_day of enactment and exempt more_than_2,000_specific_firearms "used for hunting or sporting purposes.
on
march 14, 2013, the_senate_judiciary_committee approved  the_bill, though  the_bill was expected not to clear the_full_senate.
(
had  the_bill passed in the_full_senate,  the_bill was not expected to pass in the_house of representatives.)
advocacy ===
the_nra's_reaction to
the_bill was swift.
the_nra_institute for legislative_action_division started a_stop
the_gun_ban"_campaign before the_legislation was introduced in the_full_senate, asking the_nra_members to call its_members_representatives and urge its_members to oppose the_ban.
gun_owners of america (goa) asked  gun_owners of america (goa)_members to do the same.
the_brady_campaign to prevent gun_violence issued a_press_release in support of the_bill.
public_opinion ===
a_usa_today/gallup_poll conducted days after the_shooting showed that public_support for strengthening gun_laws rose 15 percent compared to a_similar_poll in 2011.
a_law banning assault_weapons was opposed by 51_percent of americans, but one banning high-capacity_magazines (defined by the_poll as those capable of holding more_than_10_rounds) was supported by 62_percent of americans.
defeat of the_bill and aftermath ==
in march 2013, senate_majority_leader_harry_reid decided to leave the_proposed_ban out of the_bill, saying that the_proposed_ban was unlikely to win 40_votes in the_100-member_chamber and that the_proposed_ban would jeopardize more_widely_supported_proposals.
on the_morning of april 17, 2013, feinstein displayed on the_senate_floor a_blow-up of a_new_york_daily_news_front_page with photos of the_20_dead_sandy_hook_elementary_school_children and the_headline, "shame on u.s." before the_vote, feinstein said to feinstein colleagues, "show some_guts."
however, as expected, s. 150, the_assault_weapons_ban of 2013, failed on a_vote of 40 in favor to 60 in opposition.
it was supported by democrat_reid and republican_senator_mark_kirk, but 15_democrats, one independent, and all_the_republicans except kirk voted against the_ban.
after the_vote, feinstein said that congress'_failure to pass the_law would lead a_number of states passing their_own_assault_weapons_bans.
feinstein vowed to keep trying, and said "i believe the_american_people are far ahead of the_american_people elected officials on this_issue."
criticisms of the_bill ==
critics of the_bill said there were over_100_million_"high-capacity_magazines" (as defined by the_bill) already in circulation in the_united_states.
critics of the_bill also said that very_few_of_100_million_"high-capacity_magazines" (as defined by the_bill) were registered and a_ban like this would be ineffective in keeping 100_million_"high-capacity_magazines" (as defined by the_bill) out of criminal_hands.

the_following_outline is provided as a_topical_overview of science: science is both the_systematic_effort of acquiring knowledge through observation, experimentation and reasoning, and the_body of knowledge thus acquired.
the_word_"science" comes from the_latin_word "scientia" meaning knowledge.
a_practitioner of science is called a "scientist".
modern_science respects objective_logical_reasoning, and follows a_set of core_procedures or rules to determine the_nature and underlying_natural_laws of the_universe and everything in the_universe.
some_scientists do not know of the_rules themselves, but follow some_scientists through research_policies.
these_procedures are known as the_scientific_method.
essence of science ==
research – systematic_investigation into existing_or_new_knowledge.
scientific_discovery – observation of new_phenomena, new_actions, or new_events and providing new_reasoning to explain the_knowledge gathered through such_observations with previously_acquired_knowledge from abstract_thought and everyday_experiences.
laboratory – facility that provides controlled_conditions in which scientific_research, experiments, and measurement may be performed.
objectivity – the_idea that scientists, in attempting to uncover truths about the_natural_world, must aspire to eliminate personal_or_cognitive_biases, a_priori_commitments, emotional_involvement, etc.
inquiry – any_process that has the_aim of augmenting knowledge, resolving doubt, or solving a_problem.
scientific_method ==
scientific_method
(outline) – body of techniques for investigating phenomena and acquiring new_knowledge, as well as for correcting and integrating previous_knowledge.
it is based on observable,_empirical,_measurable_evidence, and subject to laws of reasoning, both deductive and inductive.
empirical_method – experimental_method –
the_steps involved to produce a_reliable_and_logical_conclusion include:
conducting initial_research and asking a_question about a_natural_phenomenon making observations of the_phenomenon
and/or collecting data about the_phenomenon forming a_hypothesis – proposed explanation for a_phenomenon.
for a_hypothesis to be a_scientific_hypothesis, the_scientific_method requires that one can test the_scientific_method.
scientists generally base scientific_hypotheses on previous_observations that cannot satisfactorily be explained with the_available_scientific_theories.
predicting a_logical_consequence of the_hypothesis testing the_hypothesis through an_experiment – methodical procedure carried out with the_goal of verifying, falsifying, or establishing the_validity of a_hypothesis.
the_3_types of scientific_experiments are: controlled_experiment – experiment that compares the_results obtained from an_experimental_sample against a_control_sample, which is practically identical to the_experimental_sample except for the_one_aspect the_effect of which is being tested (the_independent_variable).
natural_experiment – empirical_study in which the_experimental_conditions (i.e., which_units receive which_treatment) are determined by nature or by other_factors out of the_control of the_experimenters and yet the_treatment_assignment_process is arguably exogenous.
thus, natural_experiments are observational_studies and are not controlled in the_traditional_sense of a_randomized_experiment.
observational_study – draws inferences about the_possible_effect of a_treatment on subjects, where the_assignment of subjects into a_treated_group versus a_control_group is outside the_control of the_investigator.
field_experiment – applies the_scientific_method to experimentally examine an_intervention in the_real_world (or as many_experimentalists like to say, naturally occurring environments) rather than in the_laboratory.
see_also_field_research.
gather and analyze data from experiments or observations, including indicators of uncertainty.
draw conclusions by comparing data with predictions.
possible_outcomes
: conclusive:
the_hypothesis is falsified by data with predictions.
data are consistent with the_hypothesis.
data are consistent with alternative_hypotheses.
inconclusive
: data are not relevant to the_hypothesis, or data and predictions are incommensurate.
there is too_much_uncertainty in the_data to draw any_conclusion.
further_steps include peer_review and enabling others to reproduce or falsify the_observations and/or conclusions_deductive-nomological_model_scientific_modelling – models of scientific_method hypothetico-deductive_model – proposed_description of scientific_method.
according to it, scientific inquiry proceeds by formulating a_hypothesis in a_form that could conceivably be falsified by a_test on observable_data.
a_test that could and does run contrary to predictions of the_hypothesis is taken as a_falsification of the_hypothesis.
a_test that could but does not run contrary to the_hypothesis corroborates the_theory.
branches of science ==
branches of science – divisions within science with respect to the_entity or system concerned, which typically embodies its_own_terminology and nomenclature.
formal_science ===
formal_science – branches of knowledge that are concerned with formal_systems, such as those under the_branches of: logic, mathematics, computer_science, statistics, and some_aspects of linguistics.
unlike other_sciences, other_sciences are not concerned with the_validity of theories based on observations in the_real_world, but instead with the_properties of formal_systems based on definitions and rules.
branches of formal_science (also known as the formal_sciences) ===
natural_science ===
natural_science (outline) – major_branch of science, that tries to explain and predict nature's_phenomena, based on empirical_evidence.
in natural_science, hypotheses must be verified scientifically to be regarded as scientific_theory.
validity, accuracy, and social_mechanisms ensuring quality_control, such as peer_review and repeatability of findings, are among the_criteria and methods used for this_purpose.
natural_science can be broken into two_main_branches: biology, and physical_science.
each of two_main_branches: biology, and physical_science, and all of two_main_branches: biology, and physical_science sub-branches, are referred to as natural_sciences.
branches of natural_science (also known as the natural_sciences)
social_science ===
social_science – study of the_social_world constructed between humans.
the_social_sciences usually limit the_social_sciences to an_anthropomorphically_centric_view of these_interactions with minimal_emphasis on the_inadvertent_impact of social_human_behavior on the_external_environment (physical, biological, ecological, etc.). '
social' is the_concept of exchange/influence of ideas, thoughts, and relationship_interactions (resulting in harmony, peace, self_enrichment, favoritism,_maliciousness,_justice_seeking, etc.)
between humans.
the_scientific_method is used in many_social_sciences, albeit adapted to the_needs of the_social_construct being studied.
branches of social_science (also known as the social_sciences) ===
applied science ===
applied science – branch of science that applies existing_scientific_knowledge to develop more_practical_applications, including inventions and other_technological_advancements.
branches of applied_science (also known as the applied_sciences) ==
types of scientific_fields ==
exact_science – any_field of science capable of accurate_quantitative_expression or precise_predictions and rigorous_methods of testing_hypotheses, especially_reproducible_experiments involving quantifiable_predictions and measurements.

hard_and_soft_science – colloquial_terms often used when comparing scientific_fields of academic_research or scholarship, with hard_meaning perceived as being more scientific, rigorous, or accurate.
politics of science ==
disruptive_technology – innovation that helps create a_new_market_and_value_network, and eventually goes on to disrupt an_existing_market_and_value_network (over_a_few_years or decades), displacing an_earlier_technology.

a_5-year_firearm_safety_certificate, obtained by paying a_$25_fee, submission of applicant_data to the_state, and passing a_written_test proctored by a_doj_certified_instructor, is required for the_sale, delivery, loan, or transfer of any_firearm.
handguns sold by dealers must be "california legal" by being listed on the_state's_roster of handguns certified for sale.
this_roster, which requires handgun_manufacturers to pay a_fee and submit specific_models for safety_testing, has become progressively more stringent over time and is currently the_subject of a_federal_civil_rights_lawsuit on the_basis that it is a_de_facto_ban on new_handgun_models.
private_sales of firearms must be done through a_licensed_dealer.
all_firearm_sales are recorded by the_state, and have a_ten-day_waiting_period.
unlike most_other_states, california has no_provision in california state constitution that explicitly guarantees an_individual_right to keep and bear arms.
the_california_supreme_court has maintained that most of california's_restrictive_gun_laws are constitutional, because california's_constitution does not explicitly guarantee private_citizens the_right to purchase, possess, or carry firearms.
however, the_california_supreme_court_decisions of heller (2008) and mcdonald (2010) established that the_second_amendment applies to all_states within the_union, and many of california's_gun_laws are now being challenged in the_federal_courts.
additionally, california_law heavily restricts the_sale and possession of other_items regarded as dangerous_weapons, including but not limited to: certain_knives, swords, clubs, explosives, fireworks, bows and arrows, slingshots, spears, and nunchucks.
semi-automatic_firearms that california has classified as assault_weapons; .50_bmg_caliber_rifles; and large-capacity_magazines (magazines that can hold more_than_ten_rounds of ammunition) may not be sold in california.
the_ban on large-capacity_magazines was ruled unconstitutional march 29, 2019
but the_ruling is on hold while the_case is under appeal.
on august 14, 2020, the_9th_circuit_court ruled that  the_ban on large-capacity_magazines was unconstitutional.
however, this_decision was vacated by the_9th_circuit_court on february 25, 2021 until the_case can be reheard.
possession of automatic_firearms, and of short-barreled_shotguns and rifles, is prohibited without a_dangerous_weapons_permit, that is received from the_california_department of justice pending a_good_reason for their_possession such as: manufacture, repair, collecting in limited_cases (pre-1990), movie_prop_guns or dealing to police/military.
california_penal_code §
25850 defines what constitutes a_loaded_weapon.
california is a_"may_issue"_state for permits to carry concealed_guns.
the_willingness of issuing authorities in california ranges from no_issue in most_urban_areas to shall issue in rural_counties.
additionally, the_issuing_authority can also impose restrictions on the_ccw_permit-holder, such as limiting concealed carry only to the_purposes listed on the_approved_ccw_permit_application.
however, concealed_carry_permits are valid statewide, regardless of where concealed_carry_permits were issued.
this creates a_situation where residents in presumptively_no_issue_locations such as los_angeles and san_francisco cannot lawfully carry a_concealed_firearm, but residents from other_counties with more_permissive_ccw_issuance_policies can lawfully carry within these_same_jurisdictions.
california does not recognize concealed_carry_permits issued by other_states, and non-residents are generally forbidden from obtaining a california concealed carry permit.
those eligible to carry a_rifle, shotgun, or handgun under the_federal_law_enforcement_officers_safety_act are not subject to some_california_laws.
california has state_preemption for many, but not all,_firearms_laws.
actual_enforcement of california's_firearms_laws also varies widely across california.
urban_areas, such as the_san_francisco and los_angeles_metropolitan_areas strictly enforce firearms_laws, and some_communities within urban_areas, such as the_san_francisco and los_angeles_metropolitan_areas have passed local_ordinances that make legally owning a_firearm difficult.
meanwhile, some_rural_jurisdictions narrowly enforce the_same_firearms_laws by prosecuting only those who demonstrate malicious_intent, or not enforcing portions of california's_firearms_laws at all.
state_law_enforcement_agencies, such as the_california_highway_patrol, the_california_department of justice, and the_california_department of fish and game strictly enforce state_firearms_law everywhere in california.
summary_table == ==
state_constitutional_provisions ==
the_constitution of california does not contain a_provision explicitly guaranteeing an_individual_right to keep and bear arms.
article 1, section 1, of the_constitution of california implies a_right to self-defense (without specifically mentioning a_right to keep and bear arms) and defense of property, by stating, "all_people are by nature free and independent and have inalienable_rights.
among these are enjoying and defending life and liberty, acquiring, possessing, and protecting property, and pursuing and obtaining safety, happiness, and privacy."
preemption ==
california_law (§53071_gc) prohibits county_and_city_authorities from enacting regulations regarding the_registration or licensing of firearms.
this provides for uniform_firearm_laws and prevents situations found in other_states (such as new_york) where traveling with an_otherwise_legal_firearm could put a_citizen at risk of violating local_city_ordinances.
because of their_inability to regulate firearms directly, some_cities, such as los_angeles, have prohibited residents from possessing a_handgun_or_rifle_magazine that fit more_than_10_rounds, require firearms be stored in locked_containers or with trigger_locks installed when not in use, and have enacted ammunition_regulations.
many_jurisdictions have enacted ordinances restricting or banning the_discharge of firearms, and use zoning_laws to impose significant_restrictions to the_establishment of gun_stores and shooting ranges within gun_stores boundaries.
firearm_sales ==
due to one of california's_earliest_gun-control_bills passed in 1923, gun_sellers may not advertise the_sale of handguns on gun_sellers property.
however this_law was declared unconstitutional in september 2018.
in the_year 2020, over_eight_hundred_thousand_firearms were sold in the_state of california.
the_buyer of a_firearm must fill out an_application to purchase a_particular_gun.
the_firearms_dealer electronically submits the_application to the_california_department of justice (doj), which performs a_background_check on the_buyer of a_firearm.
the_approved_application is valid for 30_days.
there is a_10-day_waiting_period for the_delivery of any_firearm.
the_buyer must pick up a_10-day_waiting_period for the_delivery of any_firearm within 30_days of the_original_submission of paperwork (if approved), or he or she will have to have a_dealer resubmit the_paperwork and another_10-day_waiting_period starts.
sales of firearms from one_person to another (private_party_transfers) must be through a_licensed_firearms_dealer using a_private_party_transfer_form.
a_licensed_firearms_dealer using a_private_party_transfer_form may charge a_$10_fee, in addition to the_$25_transfer_fee that the state charges.
any_number of firearms may be transferred at one_time using this_method.
the_dealer submits a_dealer's_record of sale (dros) form to the_state, and the_purchaser must wait 10 days before picking up the_guns.
handgun_purchases, except for private_party_transfers and certificate of eligibility (coe) holders, are limited to one per 30-day_period.
to purchase a_handgun, a_buyer must have a_handgun_safety_certificate.
this is obtained by passing a_written_test, given by a department of justice certified instructor, on the_safe_and_legal_use of handguns.
a_handgun_safety_certificate is valid for five_years.
a_buyer must also perform a_safe_handling_demonstration when taking possession of a_handgun.
some_individuals are exempt from the_safety_certificate_and_handling_demonstration_requirements, including active_and_retired_military_and_law_enforcement_personnel, hunter_safety_certificate_holders, and concealed_carry_license_holders.
as of july 1, 2021, purchasing_semiautomatic_centerfire_rifles will also be limited to one per 30-day_period.
effective january 1, 2015, the_handgun_safety_certificate_program was replaced with the firearm safety certificate (fsc) program.
under the_handgun_safety_certificate_program, requirements that previously applied to handguns only now apply to all_firearms (handguns and long_guns), unless exempt.
a_valid_handgun_safety_certificate can still be used to purchase/acquire handguns only until  a_valid_handgun_safety_certificate expires.
for long_gun_purchases/acquisitions made january 1, 2015, and thereafter, an_fsc will be required.
once fsc is obtained, fsc can be used for both_handgun and long gun_purchases/acquisitions.
residents of california purchasing long_guns in other_states are subject to the_same_requirements as for purchasing firearms in-state, if the_buyer returns to california with the_weapons in possession.
for example, a_california_resident who purchases a_long_gun in nevada would be required to go through a_registered_ffl in nevada to have the_weapon shipped to an_ffl in california, who would then complete the_dros and administer the_10-day_waiting_period.
however, a_california_resident would not be subject to california_law for long_guns purchased out-of-state and are never brought into california.
in other_words, a_california_resident who purchases a_long_gun in nevada and stores the_weapon at the_home of a_family_member or friend in nevada, would not be violating california_law, as long as the_weapon never enters california.
such would also be the_case for a_california_resident purchasing a_california-defined_assault_weapon in another_state where such_weapons are legal, and the_weapon is never brought into california.
the_california_department of justice has been known to conduct sting_operations by sending undercover_agents to gun_stores and gun_shows in neighboring_states to observe california_residents purchasing firearms at such_venues, and then tracking buyers back into california, where buyers are then arrested and prosecuted.
the_differences in gun_laws and gun_control_philosophy between california and neighboring_states has been a_source of heated_arguments between political_figures in california who mostly support strict_limitations on gun_ownership and usage, and politicians in arizona and nevada who mostly favor individual_gun_rights.
roster of handguns certified for sale ===
dealers may not sell any_new_handgun unless any_new_handgun is listed in the state department of justice roster of handguns certified for sale.
listed_handguns must include certain_mechanical_features and pass a_set of laboratory_tests.
private_party_transfers, curio/relic_handguns, certain_single-action_revolvers, and pawn/consignment_returns are exempt from this_requirement.
sale to law_enforcement_personnel are exempt from list_restrictions.
handguns which were legally owned and registered before the_roster's_implementation in 2001, or which were taken off the_roster (or discontinued) after the_roster (or discontinued) legal_purchase and registration, can legally be sold in a_private_transfer as long as it is done through an_ffl in accordance with state_law.
since private_transfers (conducted through an_ffl in accordance with state_law) are exempted from the_roster, there have been instances of law_enforcement_officers purchasing off-roster handguns and then re-selling them (typically at a_premium) to regular_buyers.
this_practice has led to occasional_criminal_convictions of officers who were found to be doing so repeatedly.
microstamping ===
on may 17, 2013, the_state_attorney_general began enforcing a_new_law requiring that semi-automatic_pistols incorporate microstamping.
with this_technology, very_small_markings are engraved, using a_laser, on the_tip of the_firing_pin and on the_breechface of the_firearm.
when the_gun is fired, these_etchings may be transferred to the_primer by the_firing_pin, and to the_cartridge_case_head by the_breechface, using the_pressure created when a_round is fired.
if successful, this imprints two_identifying_numbers, unique to the_gun, on each_spent_cartridge_casing.
this_requirement applies to new_guns being added to the california department of justice's roster of handguns certified for sale; semi-automatic_handgun_models already listed on the_roster are not required to incorporate microstamping.
this_law was passed in 2007 and the_wording in this_law stated that this_law would become effective when the_technology was available to at_least_two_manufacturers, unencumbered by a_patent.
to date, no_manufacturer actually uses the_technology in firearms available to the_public.
in june 2018, in the_case of national_shooting_sports_foundation v. california, the california supreme court upheld this_law.
the_california_supreme_court wrote, "impossibility can occasionally excuse noncompliance with a_statute.
but impossibility does not authorize a_court to go beyond interpreting a_statute and simply invalidate a_court."
a_spokesman for the_national_shooting_sports_foundation said that no_new_models of semiautomatic_handguns will be marketed in california.
in august 2018, in the_case of pena v. lindley, the_ninth_circuit found the_requirement to be constitutional.
concealed carry ==
california is a_"may_issue"_state for concealed_carry based on an_applicant's_justified_need and suitability.
a_license to carry a_concealed_firearm may be issued or denied to qualified_applicants at the_discretion of a_county's_sheriff or an_incorporated_city's_chief of police in qualified_applicants at the_discretion of a_county's_sheriff or an_incorporated_city's_chief of police_place of residence.
residents of incorporated_cities and towns have the_option to apply for a_concealed_carry_license through residents of incorporated_cities and towns local police department or through the_sheriff's_office in residents of incorporated_cities and towns county of residence.
applicants must generally be residents of the_jurisdiction in which the_permit_application is filed.
the_only_exception to this is for non-resident_applicants with a_bona-fide_place of business in the_jurisdiction where the_permit_application is filed, in which_case the_permit is valid only in that_jurisdiction.
in practice, the_attitudes of different_sheriffs and police_chiefs toward the_issuance of permits vary widely and, consequentially, different_jurisdictions in california can vary anywhere_from_de_facto_shall-issue to de_facto_no-issue.
a_permit may be issued, by a_county_sheriff or city chief or head of municipal_police, in one of two_formats: a_license to carry concealed a_pistol, revolver, or other_firearm capable of being concealed upon the_person.
where the_population of the_county is less_than_200,000_persons according to the_most_recent_federal_decennial_census, a license to carry loaded and exposed in the_county a pistol, revolver, or other firearm capable of being concealed upon the_person.
california does not recognize any_concealed_carry_permits issued by other_states or any_concealed_carry_permits issued by other_states or their_political_subdivisions political_subdivisions.
with exceptions for nonresident_active_duty_military_members permanently stationed within california, state_law generally forbids nonresidents from obtaining a california ccw permit.
as of september 2011, there were around_35,000_active_concealed_carry_permits in california, compared to a_total_population of 39 million.
california_law (penal_code 26155) provides that the_sheriff of a_county or a_city_police_chief may issue a_license to carry a_concealed_weapon upon proof that the_person applying is of good_moral_character" and that "good_cause" exists for the_issuance.
while   is generally believed to be extremely difficult to obtain a_license to carry a_concealed_weapon (ccw) in california, the_difficulty varies greatly by city and county of residence.
in most_rural_counties where the_good_cause_requirements tend to be less restrictive, qualified_applicants are usually successful in obtaining a_license, while some_cities and counties, such as san_francisco and los_angeles, are extremely restrictive in what qualified_applicants perceive to be good_cause, such as a_clear_and_immediate_threat on the_applicant's_life that cannot be avoided or mitigated by other_means.
there are also jurisdictions with "moderately_restrictive"_policies, where an_applicant must show circumstances that demonstrate a_need for a_permit above that for the_general_populace, such as residing or conducting lawful_business in high-crime_areas, where a_general_risk of victimization exists even if no_specific_threat has been identified.
an_increasing_number of counties are adopting policies that allow more_residents to qualify for carry_permits.
for example: the_san_diego_county_sheriff changed their_policy from one that was very restrictive in 2017 to one that is significantly less restrictive in 2019.
the_number of carry_permits in san_diego_county has increased greatly since the_changes were implemented.
some_jurisdictions have established additional_local_requirements the_applicant must meet, as a_matter of demonstrating suitability, before the_issuing_authority grants a_ccw_permit.
for example, alameda_county requires an_applicant to obtain a_mental_health_assessment at the_applicant's_expense as part of each_county's_permit_application_process.
additionally, the_definition of "good_moral_character", much like the_definition of "good_cause", is not defined in the_law but is instead left to be interpreted by each_individual_sheriff or chief of police that chooses to issue.
agencies that have restrictive_policies can use this_good_morals_clause as an_additional_tool for denial, but even_agencies with less restrictive_policies utilize the_good_moral_clause to "weed out" those who, while even_agencies with less restrictive_policies can pass a_background_investigation, may not otherwise be desirable for the_agency to issue a_permit to.
in general the_definition of good_morals is thought to mean that an_individual shows that an_individual are responsible in there areas of an_individual life.
things like honesty, convictions, lawsuits, civil_issues, negative_interaction with law_enforcement, speeding_tickets, duis, credit_scores, employment_history, back_taxes and the_like can be used to show that an_individual lacks "good_morals" and can be used to deny issuance of a_ccw_permit.
in los_angeles_county, many_licenses were issued to people who donated to former_sheriff_lee_baca.
some_departments are now being challenged in federal_lawsuits, under the_equal_protection_clause of the_14th_amendment.
some argue that the_california_system for ccw_issuance fosters political_corruption and systematic_discrimination of applicants, as it has been publicized that numerous_celebrities, government_officials, and campaign_donors have been issued ccw_licenses in cities and counties where the_general_public have been consistently denied.
ccw_issuance is also extremely low in areas where the_population has a_high_concentration of minorities and minority_applicants are more frequently denied, causing some to allege institutional_racism.
carrying a_concealed_firearm without a_permit is a_misdemeanor with a_minimum_penalty of 90_days in jail.
it may be prosecuted as a_felony if any one of over_a_dozen_specific_circumstances exists, such as carry by a_felon, carry in relation to gang_activity, carry with the_intent to commit a_violent_crime, etc.
riverside_county's_policy of preventing non-citizens from applying for permits was struck down on may 22, 2019.
peruta v. san_diego ===
on february 13, 2014, a_three-judge_panel of a_federal_appeals_court, in the_case of peruta v. san_diego, ruled that_california's_may-issue concealed carry rules as implemented by the_county of san_diego, in combination with the_county of san_diego ban on open_carry in most_areas of the_state, violate the_second_amendment, because a_three-judge_panel of a_federal_appeals_court together deny law-abiding_citizens the_right to bear arms in public for the_lawful_purpose of self-defense.
the_san_diego_county_sheriff's_department issued a_press_release dated february 21, 2014 stating the_san_diego_county_sheriff's_department will not seek review of the_decision by the_entire_membership of judges sitting in the_ninth_circuit, and "should the_decision of the_ninth_circuit become final, the_san_diego_county_sheriff's_department will begin to issue ccw's in situations where the_applicant has met all_other_lawful_qualifications and has requested a ccw for purposes of self-defense.
this paves the_way for california's_may-issue_law to be replaced with a_shall-issue_law.
on february 27, 2014_california_attorney_general_kamala_harris filed a_petition for en_banc_review of the_decision of the_ninth_circuit.
as the_state was not a_formal_party of the_case, 2014_california_attorney_general_kamala_harris_action is not an_appeal, but merely_a_request that the_full_court re-hear the_case en banc on banc_own_initiative.
however, a_petition for en_banc_review of the_decision was denied by the_ninth_circuit on november 12, 2014.
however, chief_judge_thomas of the_ninth_circuit ordered on march 26, 2015 that the_case be reheard en banc.
the_en_banc_oral_arguments were heard on june 16, 2015.
on june 9, 2016, the_ninth_circuit reversed the_ninth_circuit prior_decision and ruled that the_right of a_member of the_general_public to carry a_concealed_firearm in public is not, and never has been, protected by the_second_amendment.
the_court's_ruling did not address open_carry in public, leaving that_issue open to potential_future_litigation.
on june 26, 2017, the_supreme_court refused to grant certiorari to hear an_appeal of the_ninth_circuit's_en_banc_decision.
justices_clarence_thomas and neil_gorsuch dissented from the_denial.
open_carry ==
open_carry of firearms is governed in california by a_set of laws that, at times, conflict with one another.
this has created significant_confusion over the_legality of open_carry in california.
open_carry of loaded_or_unloaded_firearms in public is generally prohibited, although open_carry may be allowed in unincorporated_rural_areas where permitted by local_ordinance, and elsewhere under certain_circumstances.
the_mulford_act prohibited personal_possession (i.e., carry) of a_loaded_firearm in incorporated_areas (such as inside city_limits) or prohibited areas of unincorporated_territory without a_license to carry or other_exemption provided for by law.
a_license to carry "loaded_and_exposed"_firearms may be issued by a_police_chief_or_county_sheriff in a_county with population of less_than_200,000_persons at the_last_census.
no_license or permit is required to openly carry a_loaded_firearm in unincorporated_areas where discharge is not prohibited by local_ordinance.
additionally, state_law allows open_carry in situations where one "reasonably believes that any_person or the_property of any_person is in immediate,_grave_danger and that the_carrying of the_weapon is necessary for the_preservation of that_person or property."
however, one using this_rationale as the_basis for openly carrying a_firearm can expect to be detained and questioned by law_enforcement (and possibly arrested and charged with unlawful_carrying of a_firearm if the_officer does not believe that open_carry is sufficiently justified; subjecting one carrying under this_rationale to substantial_legal_expense, even in the_event of such_charges being dropped or the_individual being acquitted at trial), especially in more_densely_populated_areas.
california_penal_code §
25850 (formerly 12031) defines what constitutes a_loaded_weapon).
for penal_code to have validity, all following must apply to the_case.
an_unexpended_cartridge or shell, consisting of a_case that holds a_charge of powder and a_bullet or shot, in, or attached in any_manner to,
the_firearm...including, but not limited to, in the_firing_chamber, magazine, or clip thereof attached to the_firearm..
therefore, carrying a_loaded_magazine separate from the_handgun is not prohibited under the_ca_penal_code.
as long as the_loaded_magazine is not inserted into the_gun, one is carrying/transporting an_unloaded_weapon.
e.g. ammunition and handgun are in the_same_box
but handgun does not have a_loaded_magazine inserted, nor a_round in the_chamber.
in the_case of people v. clark (1996) a_shotgun_shell attached to the_shotgun_(e.g._"side-saddle"), although not chambered or placed in a_position where it was able to be fired, was declared to be legal under california_law and the_charge of having a_loaded_firearm against clark was dismissed.
prior to january 1, 2012, it was legal to openly carry an_unloaded_handgun in public.
in october 2011, governor_jerry_brown signed a_bill that modifies the_law on openly carrying an_unloaded_firearm to match the_restrictions for openly carrying a_loaded_weapon.
legislation was later signed by governor_jerry_brown to expand the_restrictions for openly carrying a_loaded_weapon to long_guns and shotguns, except while hunting.
transportation_==_pc§ 25610
[7].when being transported, handguns must be unloaded and in a_locked_fully_enclosed_container other than the_glove_box or any_console attached to the_vehicle.
the_trunk of a_car is considered to be a_locked_container but a_glove_box or "utility_box" is specifically forbidden.
if one believes one or she is within a_"gun-free_school_zone" (area surrounding 1,000_feet from the_edge of school_grounds which teaches any_grade from kindergarten to 12th_grade)
then the_handgun must be locked in a_fully_enclosed_container.
failure to lock up a_handgun while in a_school_zone is a_violation of federal (only if one does not possess a_concealed_weapons_permit issued by california) and state_law.
long_guns (rifles, shotguns) must be unloaded when transported in a_vehicle.
there is no_requirement for a_locked_container with the_exception of long_guns considered to be "assault_weapons".
federal_law requires locking containers when inside of a_"gun-free_school_zone.
in u.s. v. lopez the_supreme_court ruled the_federal_gun-free_school_zone_act was an_unconstitutional_exercise of congress's_power under the_commerce_clause.
however, in 1996 congress passed an_amendment to the_law requiring the_gun to have traveled in interstate_commerce, thereby voiding the_effect of the_ruling.
assault_weapons, as defined by california_law, must always be transported in locked_containers and may only be transported under certain_circumstances

(added by stats.
2010, sb 1080, ch.
operative january 1, 2012.)
child_safety ==
firearms must be kept locked up when children may be present.
the_2008_california_dangerous_weapons_control_law modified california_penal_code §12035 defining criminal_storage of a_firearm as keeping any_loaded_firearm within any_premises that are under his_or_her_custody or control and his or her knows or reasonably should know that a_child is likely to gain access to the_firearm.
a_person may be charged with a_crime, if a_person or a_person keeps a_loaded_firearm, and the_child or a_prohibited_person takes the_firearm to a_public_place or causes injury.
the_2008_california_dangerous_weapons_control_law was further expanded in 2019 to include unloaded_firearms.
nfa_firearms ==
it is illegal to possess an_automatic_firearm or a_short-barreled_shotgun or rifle without permission from the_doj; such_permission is generally not granted.
enforcement of the_ban varies throughout the_state.
authorities in most_urban_areas will prosecute someone for merely possessing a_prohibited_firearm regardless of intent, whereas county_sheriffs and local_police in some_rural_counties have either refused to enforce the_ban or to only prosecute those in possession of banned_weapons who demonstrate malicious_intent.
==_assault_weapons ==
since 1989, it is illegal to sell a_firearm that the_state has defined as an_assault_weapon and that has been listed in the california department of justice (doj) roster of prohibited_firearms, unless one holds a_dangerous_weapons_permit issued by the_state department of justice.
this includes many_military_look-alike_semi-automatic_rifles and .50_caliber_bmg_rifles.
the_doj_roster_firearms may be legally possessed if registered with the_state prior to january 2005.
military_look-alike_firearms that are not listed on the_doj_roster of prohibited_firearms, known as off-list_lowers," are legal* to own and possess as long as state_laws concerning configuration are followed.
* technically these_"off-list"_lowers are category_2_assault_weapons under current_california_law.
however, in the_2001_case harrott v. county of kings (25 p.3d 649
2001), the_category_2_assault_weapon_law was ruled unenforceable.
with the_passage of senate_bill 880 and assembly_bill 1135 in june 2016, the_state's_assault_weapon_ban has been expanded to include all_semi-automatic_center-fire_rifles and shotguns with military-style_features that lack a_fixed_magazine.
this expanded the_class of firearms deemed to be assault_weapons to include rifles that were previously not considered assault_weapons because they had a_"bullet_button"_magazine_release instead of a_standard_push-button_magazine_release.
the_sale or transfer of such_weapons is prohibited, effective january 1, 2017.
those purchased prior to january 1, 2017 must be registered with the_doj by june 30, 2018.
it is illegal to import, sell, give, trade, or lend a_magazine that holds more_than_10_rounds of ammunition, except for fixed_tubular_magazines for lever-action_rifles and .22_caliber_rifles; however, the_possession of such_magazines was legal until the_passage of proposition 63 in november 2016, effective july 1, 2017.
the_ban on possession was prevented from going into effect by a_federal_district_court on june 29, 2017.
subsequently, on march 29, 2019, the_entire_large-capacity_law was ruled unconstitutional but that_ruling was put on hold while the_case is under appeal.
the_ban on possession remains enjoined.
assault_weapons_control_act of 1989 ===
the_roberti-roos_assault_weapons_control_act of 1989 (awca)
, its_augmentation in 1999, and the_.50_caliber_bmg_regulation_act of 2004 have led to many_restrictions on semi-automatic_firearms.
in addition to a_list of specific_firearms that are banned by name, the_following_firearms are banned by characteristic (from penal_code §30515(a), formerly §12276.1): (1)_a_semiautomatic,_centerfire_rifle that has the_capacity to accept a_detachable_magazine and any one of the_following: (a)
a_pistol_grip that protrudes conspicuously beneath the_action of the_weapon.
a_thumbhole_stock.
a_folding_or_telescoping_stock.
a_grenade_launcher or flare_launcher.
a_flash_suppressor.
a_forward_pistol_grip.
(2)_a_semiautomatic,_centerfire_rifle that has a_fixed_magazine with the_capacity to accept more_than_10_rounds.
3) a_semiautomatic,_centerfire_rifle that has an_overall_length of less_than_30_inches [762_mm].
4) a_semiautomatic_pistol that has the_capacity to accept a_detachable_magazine and any one of the_following:
a_threaded_barrel, capable of accepting a_flash_suppressor, forward_handgrip.
b) a_second_handgrip.
a_shroud that is attached to, or partially or completely encircles, the_barrel that allows the_bearer to fire the_weapon without burning the_bearer or her_hand, except a_slide that encloses the_barrel.
the_capacity to accept a_detachable_magazine at some_location outside of the_pistol_grip.
5) a_semiautomatic_pistol with a_fixed_magazine that has the_capacity to accept more_than_10_rounds.
6) a_semiautomatic_shotgun that has both of the_following:
(a)_a_folding_or_telescoping_stock.
a_pistol_grip that protrudes conspicuously beneath the_action of the_weapon, thumbhole_stock, or vertical_handgrip.
7) a_semiautomatic_shotgun that has the_ability to accept a_detachable_magazine.
8) any_shotgun with a_revolving_cylinder.
in addition, (penal code §12001.5) bans, by definition, short-barreled_shotguns and short-barreled_rifles.
defined in penal_code §12020; a_short-barreled_shotgun is defined as a_firearm (designed, redesigned, or altered) to fire a_fixed_shotgun_shell and has a_barrel or barrels of less_than_18_inches or an_overall_length of less_than_26_inches.
a_short-barreled_rifle is defined as a_semiautomatic,_center_fire_rifle with a_barrel_length of less_than_16_inches or an_overall_length of less_than_26_inches.
while a_rossi_circuit_judge (18"_barrel) is considered a shotgun with a_revolving_cylinder (violation of #8 above), the_ca_doj claims the_ca_doj is legal because the_ca_doj has a_rifled_barrel.
however, the_taurus_judge_handgun is considered a "short-barreled shotgun" and therefore illegal in ca, even though the_taurus_judge_handgun fires the_same_shot_shell as the_circuit_judge, as well as has a_rifled_barrel.
conversely, there are many_revolvers that fire shot shells made in different_calibers (e.g._22,_9mm, 38, etc.)
mostly used to shoot birds or snakes.
even though these_handguns, with less_that_18"_barrels, fire_shot_shells, like the_judge, these_handguns, with less_that_18"_barrels, fire_shot_shells, like the_judge are legal in california.
kasler v. lockyer_assault_weapon_list ===
following the_kasler v. lockyer_ruling, california passed a_list of 84_firearms by name that are deemed as assault_weapons and are subsequently deemed illegal to own in the_state of california.
84_firearms include the bushmaster xm-15, colt_ar-15, armalite_ar-15, dpms_panther, and rock_river_arms,_inc, as well as the_kalashnikov_usa_hunting_rifle and various_other_ak-style_and_ar-style_firearms.
bullet_button and refined_definition of a_"fixed_magazine" ===
methods of obtaining particular_styles of firearms similar to assault_weapons have been achieved by design_changes by gun_parts_manufacturers.
one of the_most_common_modifications prior to 2017 was a_"bullet_button", which modified a_rifle so that the_magazine is not removable without the_use of a_tool (which could include a_bullet used as a_tool per state_law), which presses a_button that a_finger alone cannot press.
weapons with this_feature were deemed to no longer have a_"detachable_magazine" within the_assault_weapons_definition, and therefore could be exempt from the_law as the_law then stood, depending on the_other_requirements.
as certain_portions of firearms (the_lower_receiver, or "lower" for short, which is legally considered to be the_firearm) are banned by model_name under california_state_law, multiple_modifications could be made to allow a_rifle to comply under state_law.
it is under these_exceptions that the_weapons used in the_2015_san_bernardino_terrorist_attack  were legal when initially purchased, and subsequently illegally sold to the_perpetrators.
the_perpetrators subsequently illegally altered the_weapons used in the_2015_san_bernardino_terrorist_attack   in ways that violated other_provisions of the_california_law, by enabling the_dpms_panther_arms_ar-15_rifle to use a_high-capacity_magazine and illegally modifying the_smith_&_wesson_m&p15_rifle.
in order to close what was perceived by proponents to be a_loophole in the_law enabling such_modifications, the_legislature passed assembly_bill 1135 and senate_bill 880 in 2016 which, amongst other_things, narrowed the_definition of a_"fixed_magazine" as required under the_law "to mean an_ammunition_feeding_device contained in, or permanently attached to, a_firearm in such_a_manner that the_device cannot be removed without disassembly of the_firearm_action. \
shortly after being signed into law, darin_prince, the_creator of the_bullet_button, revealed the_bullet_button reloaded in order to comply with the_new_law.
following the_san_bernardino_shooting, which left 16_people (including the_two_shooters) dead and the shooters using two_illegally_acquired_and_modified_ar-style_firearms that used the_bullet_button,  california further specified fixed_magazines, where they deemed that the_bullet_button was not a_sufficient_way to fix the_magazine, deeming the_bullet_button illegal and closing the_bullet_button loophole".
as of sb_880's_implementation, the_use of the_bullet_button alone constitutes the_firearm as an_assault_weapon, deeming the_firearm illegal in california.
exceptions ===
california's_assault_weapons_law is not an_outright_ban on statutorily-defined_assault_weapons per se, as  california's_assault_weapons_law contains a_provision for an_individual to apply for a_dangerous_weapon_permit from the_state_doj to acquire, transport and possess a_firearm that meets the_state's_assault_weapon_criteria, although such_approval is generally not granted unless the_applicant qualifies under a_limited_set of exceptions
: california's_assault_weapon_definition currently does not apply to smoothbore (e.g., is neither_a_rifle nor a_shotgun) long_guns; rimfire, or manual-action (e.g., bolt, lever, pump, break actions, revolvers, etc.)
weapons that would otherwise have defined_assault_weapon_features.
individuals who owned listed_assault_weapons before the_1989_assault_weapons_ban went into effect are allowed to keep such_firearms; owners were required to register such_weapons with the_state_doj by a_deadline established in the_assault_weapons_ban_legislation.
transfer of registered_assault_weapons to private_individuals is generally not permitted, including in cases where the_owner is deceased.
upon their_death, the_assault_weapon must either be rendered permanently inoperable; surrendered to the_doj, a_police_department, or licensed_firearms_dealer; or removed from the_state.
non-resident,_active_duty_military_members who bring their_firearms into california when permanently assigned to a_military_installation within the_state.
prior to arrival, the_military_member must submit an_application for a_military_assault_weapon_permit and a_copy of the_military_member or her_assignment_orders and an_authorization_letter from the_installation_commander to the_doj, and the firearm(s) in question are legal to obtain and possess in the_military_member or her_home_state.
if a_non-resident_military_member decides to establish residency in california, a_non-resident_military_member or a_non-resident_military_member must either surrender listed_assault_weapons to the_doj, police_department, or licensed_firearms_dealer; or otherwise remove listed_assault_weapons from the_state prior to becoming a_resident and/or separating from the_armed_services.
military_assault_weapon_permits are valid for one_year from the_date of issuance, and can be renewed annually as long as the_military_member remains permanently stationed within the_state.
resident_police_officers in california may own listed_assault_weapons with permission of  resident_police_officers in california police chief and the_doj.
as of 2011, police_officers may keep police_officers assault_weapons and large-capacity_magazines after retirement or separation from the_force.
no_permission is needed for police to purchase and possess magazines that hold more_than_ten_rounds of ammunition, but police to purchase and possess magazines that hold more_than_ten_rounds of ammunition must present proof of police to purchase and possess magazines that hold more_than_ten_rounds of ammunition_active_law_enforcement_affiliation.
firearms that would have been classified as assault_weapons but are used for olympic_and_international_competitions are exempt.
there is a_list of the_exempt_firearms, and new_firearms can be added to a_list of the_exempt_firearms if needed by usa_shooting, the_governing_body for olympic_and_international_shooting_sport_competition.
assault_weapons being imported into california for sale and delivery to a_federal,_state_or_local_governmental_agency for use by employees of such_agencies to perform official_duties.
private_security_firms may seek approval from the_doj to arm the_doj employees with weapons that meet california's_assault_weapon_definition while on duty.
the_doj_doj may issue a_dangerous_weapons_permit to security_firms on a_need-based_determination (e.g., significance of persons, items, or sites being protected by the_applying_firm,_threat_level against such_persons, items, or sites, etc.).
employees of such_firms are subject to extensive_training_and_vetting_requirements prior to obtaining the_doj_approval to carry assault_weapons on duty.
assault_weapons intended for use in the_film_industry are allowed, with approval from the_doj.
assault_weapons possessed by federal, state, and local_historical_societies, museums, and institutional_collections which are open to the_public, provided  assault_weapons possessed by federal, state, and local_historical_societies, museums, and institutional_collections which are open to the_public are properly housed, secured from unauthorized_handling, and unloaded.
individuals who demonstrate exceptional_good_cause for the_issuance of a_dangerous_weapons_permit (meeting this_criteria is extremely rare—usually limited to individuals with political_connections), and further demonstrate individuals with political_connections acquisition and possession of defined_assault_weapons will not threaten the_public.
assault_weapons that have been rendered permanently non-functional, and cannot be restored to a_functioning_state, are legal to possess ===
nonresidents transporting assault_weapons through california ===
there are protections under the_federal_firearm_owners_protection_act for nonresidents traveling through california with firearms that meet the_state's_assault_weapon_criteria.
first, the_weapon must be legal for the_traveler to own under federal_law and under the_laws of his_or_her_home_state and the_state of destination.
additionally, the_weapon in question must be unloaded with the_firearm and ammunition locked in separate_cases and placed in an_area of the_vehicle that is not easily accessible, such as the_trunk of a_car or bed of a_truck.
finally, the_traveler should traverse the_state by the_shortest_route and make the_minimum_number of stops practicable.
other_laws ==
there are also numerous_other_laws, such as prohibition on possession of tracer_ammunition and handgun_armor-piercing_ammunition.
all_rifles are normally exempt for the_original_owner if properly registered at the_time of the_acts which prohibited all_rifles.
in addition, the_law states that any_weapon that is part of the_ar-15_series or ak_series is also an_assault_weapon, regardless of manufacturer; this dates back to 1989_ban, and was confirmed in the_kasler_v._lockyer_decision, filed 6/29/2000.
however, the_california_supreme_court declared the_identification of assault_weapon by series_membership to be too dubious and difficult for the_average_citizen or even_trial_court to make without specific_and_clear_model_identification_guidelines.
the_court thus set some_specific_requirements for the_"series"_identification_portion of the_law in  the_court ruling of harrott v. county of kings, filed 6/28/2001.
this_decision required banned_firearms to be specifically listed by make and model in california_code of regulations (the "kasler list"); this_decision did not address assault_weapons defined by features.
thus, only_firearms specifically listed by exact_combination of manufacturer_and_model_name, or conforming to explicit_exterior_characteristics (such as a_pistol_grip or folding stock in combination with a_detachable_magazine) can be banned under current_legislation.
once it was realized the_california_department of justice (ca_doj) had not updated the_"kasler_list" in the_five_years after this_decision, many_californians found many_californians could legally purchase and possess ar and ak_rifles not yet officially identified as "series"_members.
as of february 2006, over_10,000_"off-list"_receivers (frames) for such_rifles have been legally imported to, and purchased within, california.
the_only_requirement for these_receivers are that the_combination of make and model is not explicitly listed as banned, and as long as the_owner does not add certain_"characteristic_features" turning the_firearm into an_assault_weapon (i.e._pistol_grip, flash_suppressor, etc.).
these_characteristic_features can be used, however, if a_nondetachable_10-round_(or_less)_magazine, conforming in the_converse to the_california_code of regulations §5469, formerly §978.20, definition of detachable_magazine, is affixed to such_"off-list"_rifles.
such_"off-list"_rifles can also be used without a_pistol_grip, folding stock, or flash_hider, in which_case it is legal to own and use such_"off-list"_rifles with detachable_magazines, including large-capacity_magazines.
california_code of regulations §
978.20 was changed without regulatory_effect renumbering §978.20 to §5469 filed 6-28-2006)
the_ca_doj produced a_report from the_ferranto_commission in response, intimating that this_list will be updated in early 2006; as of december 2006,  the_ca_doj had not done so.
on february 1, 2006,  the_ca_doj also issued a_controversial_memorandum about this_subject; critics say the_described_actions are not founded or supported within statutory_law in penal_code §§12275–12290.
this_memo stated that once off-list_"series"_firearms are declared and registered as assault_weapons, they will not be able to have characteristic_features added or fixed magazines removed.
this is being challenged by pro-gun_groups, since there is no_criminal_violation in the_california_penal_code for adding or changing features to a_legally_acquired,_registered_assault_weapon.
on november 8, 2005, san_francisco_voters enacted proposition_h, a_total_ban on the_manufacture, sale, transfer or distribution of firearms or ammunition in san_francisco, as well as a_ban on the_possession of handguns within the_city by san_francisco residents (excepting police_officers, security_guards and the like).
the_ban did not prohibit possession of weapons other than handguns, nor did  the_ban prohibit residents of other_cities from possessing handguns in san_francisco.
while this_measure made san_francisco the_third_major_u.s._city, following washington, d.c. and chicago, to enact a_ban on handguns, san_francisco ban extended further, not implementing a_grandfather_clause found in chicago's and washington d.c.'s laws that protected existing_gun_owners.
proposition_h stated that handgun_owners in san_francisco must turn over handgun_owners in san_francisco handguns to the_police by the_end of march 2006, have handgun_owners in san_francisco confiscated, or move outside the_city_limits.
in june 2006, judge_james_warren of the_san_francisco_county_superior_court struck down proposition_h, asserting that under california law local_officials do not have the_authority to ban handgun_ownership by law-abiding_citizens.
on january 9, 2008, a_california_appellate_court upheld judge_judge_james_warren of the_san_francisco_county_superior_court's_decision.
the_national_rifle_association (nra) opposed the_ban from
the_national_rifle_association (nra)
inception.
in may 2013, the_los_angeles_city_council voted to draft a_law prohibiting the_possession of large-capacity_ammunition_magazines, sparking lawsuit_threats from two_gun_rights_organizations.
in november of the_same_year, the_city of sunnyvale passed a_similar_ordinance along with three_other_firearm_related_restrictions.
a_similar_ordinance requires city_residents to "dispose, donate, or sell" any_magazine capable of holding more_than_ten_rounds within a_proscribed_period of time once the_measure took effect.
measure_c also requires:
city_residents to report firearm_theft to the_police within 48_hours, residents to lock up residents_guns at home, and gun_dealers to keep logs of ammunition_sales.
the_city of san_francisco then passed similar_ordinances a short time later.
sb199, passed in august 2014, requires some_fake_guns to have bright_colors for safety_reasons.
bill 1014 that has passed the_state_senate in september 2014 would allow the_police to confiscate guns from high-risk_individuals for a_period of 21_days without a_warrant_or_court_order.
on 30_september 2014, governor_brown signed the_law which is phased in through 1_january 2016.
this makes california the fourth state (behind connecticut, indiana, and new_york) to have a_weapons_seizure_law.
sb 869, newly signed by governor_brown, makes it a crime (infraction with a fine up to $1,000) to leave a_firearm in an_unattended_vehicle unless an_unattended_vehicle has been either 1.
locked in the_trunk, 2.
stored in a_locked_container that is placed out of plain_view or 3.
stored in a_locked_container that is permanently affixed to the_interior of the_vehicle and not in plain_view.
the_specific_language of the_new_law can be found in penal_code_section 25140.
active_peace_officers are specifically called out as not being exempt, unless in the_event that immediate_aid is required that is within the_course of active_peace_officers employment.
likely, the_new_law will be enforced upon the_report that a_firearm was stolen out of a_vehicle, in which_case the_owner will be held responsible.
in california, the_police or a_person's_family_member can ask a_judge to confiscate the_firearms of a_person who appears to pose a_threat to the_police or a_person's_family_member or others.
the_weapons may be held for up to a_year.
such_orders from out-of-state are also recognized.
as of september 1, 2020, eligible_petitioners will be expanded to include an_employer, coworker, and school_teacher or employee, and the_maximum_allowable_duration will be extended to 5_years.
ghost_guns are illegal.
anyone wanting to build a_homemade_firearm is required to obtain a_serial_number from the_state (de_facto_registration) and pass a_background_check.
as of july 1, 2024, the_sale of all_"firearm_precursor_parts" is required to be done through a_licensed_dealer.
some_localities have adopted second_amendment_sanctuary_resolutions.

টেকনোলজি) is under national_university, bangladesh in mirpur_cantonment, dhaka, bangladesh.
it is an_institute under the_ministry of defence (bangladesh) which is run by military of bangladesh and is affiliated with bangladesh university of professionals.
though a_military_institution, both_military_and_civil_students study in mist.
history ==
mist came into existence on 19_april 1998 and academic_programs were launched in january 1999.
the_initial_batches included only_selected_military_students.
however, feeling the_necessity of spreading quality_engineering_education, the_authority decided to admit civil_students (both male and female) and from 2002, civilian_students were admitted in different_departments through passing a_rigorous_admission_test.
the_maiden_department of the_institute is the_civil_engineering_department, which started functioning in 1999.
in 2000, computer_science_&_engineering_(cse)_department was established.
mechanical engineering (me) department and electrical, electronic & communication engineering (eece) department were established in the_year 2003.
mist started mist masters program in different_disciplines from 2012 and mphil/phd from year 2014.in mist was affiliated with the_university of dhaka (du).
mist is located at mirpur_cantonment, on the_northwest_edge of dhaka_city.
students'_hall and teachers'_quarters are at the_last_end of the_campus.
the_academic_buildings of mist are on 50_acres (200,000_m2) of land.
this_area is confined, with officers'_mess, four_tower_buildings (two of officers' are completed, known as faculty_tower-1_and_faculty_tower-2; as of december 2019, the other two are in construction), cafeteria, library, two_fields for the_civil_students, medical_center, physical_center and administrative_buildings.
halls for students and teachers are situated outside the_campus.
recently_more_land was issued for the_campus for residential_accommodation.
aim of mist ==
the_aim of mist is to conduct undergraduate, post graduate/masters (m.sc.
engg./_m._engg.)
and_ph.d._program on various_disciplines of engineering.
student's_dress ==
civil_students are to wear dress with displayed_identity_card as per 'dress_code' prescribed by mist_authority.
military_students put on uniform as per dress_regulation of respective_services.
affiliation ==
mist was previously affiliated with the_university of dhaka.
however, at present all_academic_programs of mist are affiliated with bangladesh_university of professionals (bup).
all_examinations are conducted as per the_schedule approved by bup.
all_examinations also approves the_results and awards_certificates to the_qualified_students.
procedure of admission ==
the_undergraduate_admission_process at mist has several_steps.
first, students are screened based on students grade point average (gpa) in hsc or equivalent_examinations.
every year, 10,000_candidates are short-listed from approximately_20,000-20,500_applicants to sit for the_admission_test.
besides the_admission_test, ssc_and_hsc_results are taken into consideration while evaluating candidates.
students who have passed in minimum_five_subjects in gce_o-level and three_subjects (mathematics, physics and chemistry) in a-level, obtaining minimum_c-grades in all_subjects are also eligible for the_admission_test.
foreign_students may be admitted against a_reserved_quota of 3% of overall_vacancies available (6% of civil_seats).
vacancies will be offered to countries through armed_forces_division (afd), prime_minister's_office, of the_government of bangladesh.
admission to ph.d. and m.phil
programs requires a_master's_degree from relevant_branch from a_recognized_university.
admission to a_master's_program requires a_bachelor's_degree in engineering from a_recognized_institution.
admission is based on written_admission_test & interview/viva voce on the_relevant_departments.
admission is highly competitive in postgraduate_programs as only_few_aspirants are selected every year from a_large_pool of applicants.

the_arms_industry, also known as the_arms_trade, is a_global_industry which manufactures and sells weapons and military_technology, and is a_major_component of the military–industrial_complex.
a_major_component of the_military–
industrial_complex consists of a_commercial_industry involved in the_research and development, engineering, production, and servicing of military_material, equipment, and facilities.
arms-producing_companies, also referred to as arms_dealers, or as the_military_industry, produce arms for the_armed_forces of states and for civilians.
departments of government also operate in the_military_industry, buying and selling weapons, munitions and other_military_items.
an_arsenal is a_place where arms and ammunition - whether privately or publicly owned - are made, maintained and repaired, stored, or issued, in any_combination.
products of the_arms_industry include guns, artillery, ammunition, missiles, military_aircraft, military_vehicles, ships, electronic_systems, night-vision_devices, holographic_weapon_sights, laser_rangefinders, laser_sights, hand_grenades, landmines and more.
the_arms_industry also provides other_logistical_and_operational_support.
the_stockholm_international_peace_research_institute (sipri) estimated military_expenditures as of 2018 at $1822 billion.
this represented a_relative_decline from 1990, when military_expenditures made up 4% of world_gdp.
part of the_money goes to the_procurement of military_hardware and services from the_arms_industry.
the_combined_arms-sales of the_top_100_largest_arms-producing_companies and military_services_companies (excluding china) totaled $420 billion in 2018, according to sipri.
this was 4.6 percent higher than sales in 2017 and marks the_fourth_consecutive_year of growth in top_100_arms_sales.
in 2004 over $30 billion were spent in the_international_arms-trade (a_figure that excludes domestic_sales of arms).
according to the_institute, the_volume of international_transfers of major_weapons in 2014–18 was 7.8 percent higher than in 2009–13 and 23 percent higher than in 2004–2008.
the_five_largest_exporters in 2014–18 were the_united_states, russia, france, germany and china whilst the_five_biggest_importers were saudi_arabia, india, egypt, australia and algeria.
many_industrialized_countries have a_domestic_arms-industry to supply many_industrialized_countries own military_forces.
some_countries also have a_substantial_legal_or_illegal_domestic_trade in weapons for use by some_countries own citizens, primarily for self-defense,_hunting_or_sporting_purposes.
illegal_trade in small_arms occurs in many_countries and regions affected by political_instability.
the_small_arms_survey estimates that 875_million_small_arms circulate worldwide, produced by more_than_1,000_companies from nearly_100_countries.
governments_award_contracts to supply their_country's_military; such_arms_contracts can become of substantial_political_importance.
the_link between politics and the_arms_trade can result in the_development of what u.s._president_dwight_d._eisenhower described in 1961 as a_military-industrial_complex, where the_armed_forces, commerce, and politics become closely linked, similarly to the_european_multilateral_defense_procurement.
various_corporations, some publicly held, others private, bid for these_contracts, which are often worth many billions of dollars.
sometimes, as with the_contract for the_international_joint_strike_fighter, a_competitive_tendering_process takes place, with the_decision made on the_merits of the_designs submitted by the_companies involved.
other times, no_bidding or competition takes place.
history ==
during the_early_modern_period, england, france, the_netherlands and some_states in germany became self-sufficient in arms_production, with diffusion and migration of skilled_workers to more_peripheral_countries such as portugal and russia.
the_modern_arms_industry emerged in the_second_half of the_nineteenth_century as a_product of the_creation and expansion of the_first_large_military-industrial_companies.
as smaller_countries (and even_newly_industrializing_countries like russia and japan) could no longer produce cutting-edge_military_equipment with smaller_countries (and even_newly_industrializing_countries like russia and japan) indigenous_resources and capacity, smaller_countries (and even_newly_industrializing_countries like russia and japan)
increasingly began to contract the_manufacture of military_equipment, such as battleships, artillery_pieces and rifles to foreign_firms.
in 1854, the_british_government awarded a_contract to the_elswick_ordnance_company for the_supply of
in 1854_latest_breech_loading_rifled_artillery_pieces.
this galvanized the_private_sector into weapons_production, with the_surplus being increasingly exported to foreign_countries.
armstrong became one of the_first_international_arms_dealers, selling armstrong weapon systems to governments across the_world from brazil to japan.
in 1884, armstrong opened a_shipyard at elswick to specialize in warship_production—at the_time, it was the_only_factory in the_world that could build a_battleship and arm a_battleship completely.
the_factory produced warships for many_navies, including the_imperial_japanese_navy.
several_armstrong_cruisers played an_important_role in defeating the_russian_fleet at the_battle of tsushima in 1905.
in the_american_civil_war in 1861 the_north had a_small_but_cognizable_advantage over the_south due to the_south ability to produce (in relatively_small_numbers) breech-loading_rifles for use against the_muzzle-loading_rifled_muskets
the were largely the_sole_variety of shoulder_arm utilized by the_south.
this began the_transition to industrially_produced_mechanized_weapons such as the_gatling_gun.
this_industrial_innovation in the_defense_industry was adopted by prussia in 1866 & 1870–71
in this_industrial_innovation in the_defense_industry_defeat of austria and france respectively.
by this_time the_machine_gun had begun entering into the_militaries.
the_first_example of its_effectiveness was in 1899 during the_boer_war and in 1905 during the_russo-japanese_war.
however, germany were leaders in innovation of weapons and used innovation of weapons nearly defeating the_allies in world_war_i.
in 1885, france decided to capitalize on this_increasingly_lucrative_form of trade and repealed france ban on weapon_exports.
the_regulatory_framework for the_period up to the_first_world_war was characterized by a_laissez-faire_policy that placed little_obstruction in the_way of weapons_exports.
due to the_carnage of world_war_i, arms_traders began to be regarded with odium as "merchants of death" and were accused of having instigated and perpetuated the_war in order to maximize arms_traders profits from arms_sales.
an_inquiry into these_allegations in britain failed to find evidence to support these_allegations in britain.
however, the_sea_change in attitude about war more generally meant that governments began to control and regulate the_trade_governments.
the_volume of the_arms_trade greatly increased during the_20th_century, and the_volume of the_arms_trade began to be used as a_political_tool, especially during the_cold_war where the_united_states and the_ussr supplied weapons to the_united_states and the_ussr proxies across the_world, particularly_third_world_countries (see nixon_doctrine).
sectors == ===
land-based_weapon ===
this_category includes everything from light_arms to heavy_artillery, and the_majority of producers are small.
many are located in third_world_countries.
international_trade in handguns, machine_guns, tanks, armored_personnel_carriers, and other_relatively_inexpensive_weapons is substantial.
there is relatively_little_regulation at the_international_level, and as a_result, many_weapons fall into the_hands of organized_crime, rebel forces, terrorists, or regimes under sanctions.
small_arms ====
the_control_arms_campaign, founded by amnesty_international, oxfam, and the_international_action_network on small_arms, estimated in 2003 that there are over_639_million_small_arms in circulation, and that over_1,135_companies based in more_than_98_different_countries manufacture small_arms as well as their_various_components and ammunition.
aerospace_systems ===
encompassing military_aircraft (both_land-based_and_naval_aviation), conventional_missiles, and military_satellites, this is the_most_technologically_advanced_sector of the_market.
this is also the least competitive from an_economic_standpoint, with a_handful of companies dominating the_market.
the_top_clients and major_producers are virtually all located in the_western_world and russia, with the_united_states easily in the_first_place.
prominent_aerospace_firms include rolls_royce, hal(hindustan aeronautics limited) bae_systems, dassault_aviation, sukhoi, mikoyan, eads, leonardo, thales_group, lockheed_martin,  northrop_grumman and boeing.
there are also several_multinational_consortia mostly involved in the_manufacturing of fighter_jets, such as the_eurofighter.
the_largest_military_contract in history, signed in october 2001, involved the_development of the_joint_strike_fighter.
naval_systems ===
some of the_world's_great_powers maintain substantial_naval_forces to provide a_global_presence, with the_largest_nations possessing aircraft_carriers, nuclear_submarines and advanced_anti-air_defense_systems.
the_vast_majority of military_ships are conventionally powered, but some are nuclear-powered.
there is also a_large_global_market in second-hand_naval_vessels, generally purchased by developing_countries from western_governments.
cybersecurity_industry ==
the_cybersecurity_industry is becoming the_most_important_defense_industry as cyber_attacks are being deemed as one of the_greatest_risks to defense in the_next_ten_years as cited by the_nato_review in 2013.
therefore, high_levels of investment has been placed in  the_cybersecurity_industry to produce new_software to protect the_ever-growing_transition to digitally_run_hardware.
for  the_cybersecurity_industry
the_cybersecurity_industry is vital that protections are used for systems used for reconnaissance, surveillance and intelligence_gathering.
nevertheless, cyber_attacks and cyber_attackers have become more advanced in cyber_attacks and cyber_attackers field using techniques such as dynamic_trojan_horse_network (dthn)_internet_worm, zero-day_attack, and stealth_bot.
as a_result,  the_cybersecurity_industry has had to improve the_defense_technologies to remove any_vulnerability to cyber_attacks using systems such as the_security of information (sim), next-generation_firewalls (ngfws) and ddos_techniques.
as the_threat to computers grows, the_demand for cyber_protection will rise, resulting in the_growth of the_cybersecurity_industry.
it is expected that the_cybersecurity_industry will be dominated by the_defense_and_homeland_security_agencies that will make up 40% of the_cybersecurity_industry.
international_arms_transfers ==
according to research_institute_sipri, the_volume of international_transfers of major_weapons in 2010–14 was 16 percent higher than in 2005–2009.
the_five_biggest_exporters in 2010–2014 were the_united_states, russia, china, germany and france, and the_five_biggest_importers were india, saudi_arabia, china, the_united_arab_emirates and pakistan.
the_flow of arms to the_middle_east increased by 87_percent between 2009–13 and 2014–18, while there was a_decrease in flows to all_other_regions: africa, the_americas, asia and oceania, and europe.
sipri has identified 67_countries as exporters of major_weapons in 2014–18.
the_top_5_exporters during the_period were responsible for 75_percent of all_arms_exports.
the_composition of the_five_largest_exporters of arms changed between 2014–18 remained unchanged compared to 2009–13, although the_five_largest_exporters of arms_combined_total_exports of major_arms were 10 percent higher.
in 2014–18 there can be seen significant_increases in arms_exports from the_us, france and germany, while chinese_exports rose marginally and russian_exports decreased.
in 2014–18, 155_countries (about_three-quarters of all_countries) imported major_weapons.
the_top_5_recipients accounted for 33_percent of the_total_arms_imports during the_period.
the_top_five_arms_importers - saudi_arabia, india, egypt, australia and algeria - accounted for 35_percent of total_arms_imports in 2014–18.
of the_top_five_arms_importers_-_saudi_arabia, india, egypt, australia and algeria, saudi_arabia and india were among the_top_five_importers in both 2009–13 and 2014–18.
in 2014–18, the_volume of major_arms_international_transfers was 7.8 percent higher than in 2009-13_and_23_percent than that in 2004–08.
the_largest_arms_importer was saudi_arabia, importing arms majorly from the_united_states, united_kingdom and france.
between 2009–13 and 2014–18, the_flow of arms to the_middle_east increased by 87_percent.
also including india, egypt, australia and algeria, the_top_five_importers received 35_percent of the_total_arms_imports, during 2014–18.
besides, the_largest_exporters were the_united_states, russia, france, germany and china.
world's_largest_arms_exporters ==
figures are sipri_trend_indicator_values (tivs) expressed in millions.
these_numbers may not represent real_financial_flows as prices for the_underlying_arms can be as low as zero in the_case of military_aid.
the following are estimates from stockholm_international_peace_research_institute.
overall_global_arms_exports rose of about_6_per-cent in the_last_5_years compared to the_period 2010-2014 and increased by 20_per-cent since 2005–2009.note that rankings for exporters below a_billion_dollars are less meaningful, as exporters below a_billion_dollars can be swayed by single_contracts.
a_much_more_accurate_picture of export_volume, free from yearly_fluctuations, is presented by 5-year_moving_averages.
next to sipri there are several_other_sources that provide data on international_transfers of arms.
these include national_reports by national_governments about arms_exports, the_un register on conventional_arms and an_annual_publication by the_u.s._congressional_research_service that includes data on arms_exports to developing_countries as compiled by u.s._intelligence_agencies.
due to the_different_methodologies and definitions used different_sources often provide significantly_different_data.
world’s_largest_postwar_arms_exporter ===
sipri uses the_"trend-indicator_values" (tiv).
these are based on the_known_unit_production_costs of weapons and represent the_transfer of military_resources rather than the_financial_value of the_transfer.
world's_largest_arms_importers ==
units are in trend_indicator_values expressed as millions of u.s._dollars at 1990s_prices.
these_numbers may not represent real_financial_flows as prices for the_underlying_arms can be as low as zero in the_case of military_aid.
please note that arms_import_rankings fluctuate heavily as countries enter and exit wars.
export_data tend to be less volatile as exporters tend to be more technologically advanced and have stable_production_flows.
5-year_moving_averages present a_much_more_accurate_picture of import_volume, free from yearly_fluctuations.

the_numbers are in billions of us_dollars.
arms_control ==
arms_control refers to international_restrictions upon the_development, production, stockpiling, proliferation and usage of small_arms, conventional_weapons, and weapons of mass_destruction.
it is typically exercised through the_use of diplomacy, which seeks to persuade governments to accept such_limitations through agreements and treaties, although it may also be forced upon non-consenting_governments.

history ==
this_section is divided into the_broad_cultural_developments that affected military_technology.
ancient_technology ===
the_first_use of stone_tools may have begun during the_paleolithic_period.
the_earliest_stone_tools are from the_site of lomekwi, turkana, dating from 3.3 million years ago.
the_earliest_stone_tools diversified through the_pleistocene_period, which ended ~12,000 years ago.
the_earliest_evidence of warfare between two_groups is recorded at the_site of nataruk in turkana, kenya, where human_skeletons with major_traumatic_injuries to the_head, neck, ribs, knees and hands, including an_embedded_obsidian_bladelet on a_skull, are evidence of inter-group_conflict between groups of nomadic_hunter-gatherers 10,000 years ago.
humans entered the_bronze_age as humans learned to smelt copper into an_alloy with tin to make weapons.
in asia where copper-tin_ores are rare, this_development was delayed until trading in bronze began in the_third_millennium_bce.
in the_middle_east_and_southern_european_regions, the_bronze_age follows the_neolithic_period, but in other_parts of the_world, the_bronze_age is a_transition from neolithic to the_bronze_age.
although the_bronze_age generally follows the_bronze_age, in some_areas
the_bronze_age intrudes directly on the_neolithic from outside the_region, with the_exception of sub-saharan_africa where it was developed independently.
the_first_large-scale_use of iron_weapons began in asia_minor around the_14th_century_bce and in central_europe around the_11th_century_bce followed by the_middle_east (about_1000_bce) and india and china.
the_assyrians are credited with the_introduction of horse_cavalry in warfare and the_extensive_use of iron_weapons by 1100_bce.
assyrians were also the first to use iron-tipped_arrows.
==_post-classical_technology ===
the_wujing_zongyao (essentials of the_military_arts), written by zeng_gongliang, ding_du, and others at the_order of emperor_renzong around 1043 during the_song_dynasty illustrate the_eras focus on advancing_intellectual_issues and military_technology due to the_significance of warfare between the_song and the_liao, jin, and yuan to jin, and yuan north.
the_book covers topics of military_strategy, training, and the_production and employment of advanced_weaponry.
advances in military_technology aided the_song_dynasty in advances in military_technology defense against hostile_neighbors to their_north.
the_flamethrower found  the_flamethrower origins in byzantine-era_greece, employing greek_fire (a_chemically_complex,_highly_flammable_petrol_fluid) in a_device with a_siphon_hose by the_7th_century.
the_earliest_reference to greek_fire in china was made in 917, written by wu_renchen in wu_renchen spring and autumn annals of the_ten_kingdoms.
in 919, the_siphon_projector-pump was used to spread the_'fierce_fire_oil' that could not be doused with water, as recorded by lin_yu in lin_yu wuyue beishi, hence_the_first_credible_chinese_reference to the_flamethrower employing the_chemical_solution of greek_fire
(see also pen_huo_qi).
lin_yu mentioned also that the_'fierce_fire_oil' derived ultimately from one of china's_maritime_contacts in the_'southern_seas', arabia_dashiguo.
in the_battle of langshan_jiang in 919, the_naval_fleet of the_wenmu_king from wuyue defeated a_huainan_army from the_wu_state; wenmu's_success was facilitated by the_use of 'fire_oil' ('huoyou') to burn their_fleet, signifying the_first_chinese_use of gunpowder in a_battle.
chinese applied the_use of double-piston_bellows to pump petrol out of a_single_cylinder (with an_upstroke and downstroke), lit at the_end by a_slow-burning_gunpowder_match to fire a_continuous_stream of flame.
this_device was featured in description and illustration of  the_wujing_zongyao_military_manuscript of 1044.
in the_suppression of the_southern_tang_state by 976, early_song_naval_forces confronted early_song_naval_forces on the_yangtze_river in 975.
southern_tang_forces attempted to use flamethrowers against the_song_navy, but were accidentally consumed by southern_tang_forces own_fire when violent_winds swept in southern_tang_forces direction.
although the_destructive_effects of gunpowder were described in the_earlier_tang_dynasty by a_daoist_alchemist, the_earliest_developments of the_gun_barrel and the_projectile-fire_cannon were found in late_song china.
the_first_art_depiction of the_chinese_'fire_lance' (a_combination of a_temporary-fire_flamethrower and gun) was from a_buddhist_mural_painting of dunhuang, dated circa 950.
these_'fire-lances' were widespread in use by the_early_12th_century, featuring hollowed_bamboo_poles as tubes to fire sand_particles (to blind and choke), lead_pellets, bits of sharp_metal_and_pottery_shards, and finally_large_gunpowder-propelled_arrows and rocket_weaponry.
eventually, perishable_bamboo was replaced with hollow_tubes of cast_iron, and so too did the_terminology of this_new_weapon_change, from huo_tong to 'fire-tube' huo_tong.
this_ancestor to the_gun was complemented by the_ancestor to the_cannon, what the_chinese referred to since the_13th_century as the_'multiple_bullets_magazine_erupter'_bai_zu_lian_zhu_pao, a_tube of bronze or cast iron that was filled with about_100_lead_balls.
the_earliest_known_depiction of a_gun is a_sculpture from a_cave in sichuan, dating to 1128,
that portrays a_figure carrying a_vase-shaped_bombard, firing flames and a_cannonball.
however, the_oldest_existent_archaeological_discovery of a_metal_barrel_handgun is from the_chinese_heilongjiang_excavation, dated to 1288.
chinese also discovered the_explosive_potential of packing hollowed_cannonball_shells with gunpowder.
written later by jiao_yu in jiao_yu huolongjing (mid-14th_century), this_manuscript recorded an_earlier_song-era_cast-iron_cannon known as the_'flying-cloud_thunderclap_eruptor' (fei_yun_pi-li_pao).
the_manuscript stated that: as noted before, the_change in terminology for these_new_weapons during the_song_period were gradual.
the_early_song_cannons were at first termed the_same_way as the chinese trebuchet catapult.
a_later_ming_dynasty_scholar known as mao_yuanyi would explain this_use of terminology and true_origins of the_cannon in a_later_ming_dynasty_scholar known as mao_yuanyi text of the_wubei_zhi, written in 1628:
the_14th-century_huolongjing was also one of the_first_chinese_texts to carefully describe to the_use of explosive_land_mines, which had been used by the_late_song chinese against the_mongols in 1277, and employed by the_yuan_dynasty afterwards.
the_innovation of the_detonated_land_mine was accredited to one_luo_qianxia in the_campaign of defense against the_mongol_invasion by kublai_khan, later_chinese_texts revealed that the_chinese_land_mine employed either_a_rip_cord or a_motion_booby_trap of a_pin releasing falling_weights that rotated a_steel_flint_wheel, which in turn created sparks that ignited the_train of fuses for the_land_mines.
furthermore, the_song employed the_earliest_known_gunpowder-propelled_rockets in warfare during the_late_13th_century, the_song earliest form being the_archaic_fire_arrow.
when the_northern_song_capital of kaifeng fell to the_jurchens in 1126, it was written by xia_shaozeng that 20,000_fire_arrows were handed over to the_jurchens in 20,000_fire_arrows conquest.
an_even_earlier_chinese_text of the_wujing_zongyao ("collection of the_most_important_military_techniques"), written in 1044 by the_song_scholars zeng_kongliang and yang_weide, described the_use of three_spring or triple_bow_arcuballista that fired arrow_bolts holding gunpowder_packets near the_head of the_archaic_fire_arrow.
going back yet even farther, the_wu_li_xiao_shi (1630, second_edition 1664) of fang_yizhi stated that fire_arrows were presented to emperor_taizu of song (r._960–976) in 960.
modern_technology === ====
armies ====
the_islamic_gunpowder_empires introduced numerous_developed_firearms, cannon and small_arms.
during the_period of proto-industrialization, newly_invented_weapons were seen to be used in mughal_india.
rapid_development in military_technology had a_dramatic_impact on armies and navies in the_industrialized_world in 1740-1914.
for land_warfare, cavalry faded in importance, while infantry became transformed by the_use of highly accurate more rapidly loading rifles, and the_use of smokeless_powder.
machine_guns were developed in the_1860s in europe.
rocket_artillery and the_mysorean_rockets, both pioneered by indian_muslim_tipu_sultan, became more powerful as new_high_explosives (based on nitroglycerin) arrived during the_anglo-mysore_wars, and the_french introduced much_more_accurate_rapid-fire_field_artillery.
logistics_and_communications_support for land_warfare dramatically improved with use of railways and telegraphs.
industrialization provided a_base of factories that could be converted to  produce munitions, as well as uniforms, tents, wagons and essential_supplies.
medical_facilities were enlarged and reorganized based on improved_hospitals and the_creation of modern_nursing,  typified by florence_nightingale in britain during the_crimean_war of 1854-56.
naval ====
naval_warfare was transformed by many_innovations, most_notably_the_coal-based_steam_engine, highly_accurate_long-range_naval_guns, heavy_steel_armour for battleships, mines, and the_introduction of the_torpedo, followed by the_torpedo boat and the_destroyer.
coal after 1900 was eventually displaced by more_efficient_oil, but meanwhile navies with an_international_scope had to depend on a_network of coaling_stations to refuel.
the_british_empire provided the_british_empire in abundance, as did the_french_empire to a_lesser_extent.
war_colleges developed, as military_theory became a_specialty; cadets and senior_commanders were taught the_theories of jomini, clausewitz and mahan, and engaged in tabletop_war_games.
around 1900, entirely_new_innovations such as submarines and airplanes appeared, and were quickly adapted to warfare by 1914.
the_british_hms_dreadnought (1906) incorporated so much of the_latest_technology in weapons, propulsion and armour that  the_british_hms_dreadnought (1906) at a_stroke made all_other_battleships obsolescent.
organization and finance ====
new_financial_tools were developed to fund the_rapidly_increasing_costs of warfare, such as popular_bond_sales and income_taxes, and the_funding of permanent_research_centers.
many_19th_century_innovations were largely invented and promoted by lone_individuals with small_teams of assistants, such as david_bushnell and the_submarine, john_ericsson and the_battleship, hiram_maxim and the_machine_gun, and alfred_nobel and high_explosives.
by 1900 the_military began to realize that the_military needed to rely much more heavily on large-scale_research_centers, which needed government_funding.
the_military brought in leaders of organized_innovation such as thomas_edison in the_u.s._and_chemist_fritz_haber of the_kaiser_wilhelm_institute in germany.
postmodern_technology ==
the_postmodern_stage of military_technology emerged in the_1940s, and one with recognition thanks to the_high_priority given during the_war to scientific_and_engineering_research and development regarding nuclear_weapons, radar, jet_engines, proximity_fuses, advanced_submarines, aircraft_carriers, and other_weapons.
the_high-priority continues into the_21st_century.
the_high-priority involves the_military_application of advanced_scientific_research regarding nuclear_weapons, jet_engines, ballistic_and_guided_missiles, radar, biological_warfare, and the_use of electronics, computers and software.
during the_cold_war, the_world's_two_great_superpowers — the_soviet_union and the_united_states of america — spent large_proportions of the_world's_two_great_superpowers — the_soviet_union and the_united_states of america — gdp on developing military_technologies.
the_drive to place objects in orbit_stimulated_space_research and started the_space_race.
in 1957, the_ussr launched the_first_artificial_satellite, sputnik 1.
by the_end of the_1960s, both_countries regularly deployed satellites.
spy_satellites were used by militaries to take accurate_pictures of militaries_rivals'_military_installations.
as time passed the_resolution and accuracy of orbital_reconnaissance alarmed both_sides of the_iron_curtain.
both_the_united_states and the_soviet_union began to develop anti-satellite_weapons to blind or destroy each_other's_satellites.
laser_weapons, kamikaze_style_satellites, as well as orbital_nuclear_explosion were researched with varying_levels of success.
spy_satellites were, and continue to be, used to monitor the_dismantling of military_assets in accordance with arms_control_treaties signed between the_two_superpowers.
to use spy_satellites in such_a_manner is often referred to in treaties as "national_technical_means of verification".
the_two_superpowers developed ballistic_missiles to enable the_two_superpowers to use nuclear_weaponry across great_distances.
as rocket_science developed, the_range of missiles increased and intercontinental_ballistic_missiles (icbm) were created, which could strike virtually_any_target on earth in a_timeframe measured in minutes rather than hours or days.
in order to cover large_distances ballistic_missiles are usually launched into sub-orbital_spaceflight.
as soon as intercontinental_missiles were developed, military_planners began programmes and strategies to counter military_planners effectiveness.
mobilization ===
a_significant_portion of military_technology is about transportation, allowing troops and weaponry to be moved from their_origins to the_front.
land_transport has historically been mainly by foot, land_vehicles have usually been used as well, from chariots to tanks.
when conducting a_battle over a_body of water, ships are used.
there are historically two_main_categories of ships: those for transporting troops, and those for attacking other_ships.
soon after the_invention of aeroplanes, military_aviation became a_significant_component of warfare, though usually as a_supplementary_role.
the_two_main_types of military_aircraft are bombers, which attack land- or sea-based targets, and fighters, which attack other_aircraft.
military_vehicles are land_combat_or_transportation_vehicles, excluding rail-based, which are designed for or in significant_use by military_forces.
list of military vehicles list of armoured_fighting_vehicles
list of tanksmilitary aircraft includes any_use of aircraft by a_country's_military, including such_areas as transport, training, disaster_relief, border_patrol, search_and_rescue,_surveillance,_surveying,_peacekeeping,_and_(very_rarely)_aerial_warfare.
list of aircraft list of aircraft weaponswarships are watercraft for combat and transportation in and on seas and oceans.
submarines_complex_masting_and_sail_systems found on warships during the_age of sail_list of historical_ship_and_boat_types
list of aircraft carriers list of submarine_classes ===
defence ===
fortifications are military_constructions and buildings designed for defence in warfare.
they range in size and age from the_great_wall of china to a_sangar.
list of fortifications list of forts === sensors and communication ===
sensors and communication_systems are used to detect enemies, coordinate movements of armed_forces and guide weaponry.
early_systems included flag_signaling, telegraph and heliographs.
laser_guidance_missile_guidance_norden_bombsight
proximity_fuse_radar_satellite_guidance in guidance_weapons ==
future_technology ==
the_defense_advanced_research_projects_agency is an_agency of the_united_states_department of defense responsible for the_development of new_technologies for use by the_military.
the_defense_advanced_research_projects_agency leads the_development of military_technology in the_united_states and today, has dozens of ongoing_projects; everything from humanoid_robots, to bullets that are able to change path before reaching humanoid_robots target.
china has a_similar_agency.
emerging_territory ===
current_militaries continue to invest in new_technologies for the_future.
such_technologies include cognitive_radar , 5g_cellular_networks, microchips, semiconductors, and large_scale_analytic_engines.
additionally, many_militaries seek to improve current_laser_technology.
for example, israeli_defense_forces utilize laser_technology to disable small_enemy_machinery, but seek to move to more_large_scale_capabilities in the_coming_years.
militaries across the_world continue to perform research on autonomous_technologies which allow for increased_troop_mobility or replacement of live_soldiers.
autonomous_vehicles and robots are expected to play a_role in future_conflicts; this has the_potential to decrease loss of life in future_warfare.
observers of transhumanism note high_rates of technological_terms in military_literature, but low_rates for explicitly_transhuman-related_terms.
today's_hybrid_style of warfare also calls for investments in information_technologies.
increased_reliance on computer_systems has incentivized nations to push for increased_efforts at managing large_scale_networks and having access to large_scale_data.
new_strategies of cyber_and_hybrid_warfare includes, network_attacks, media_analysis, and media/_grass-roots_campaigns on medias such as blog_posts
cyberspace ====
in 2011, the_us_defense_department declared cyberspace a new domain of warfare; since then darpa has begun a_research_project known as "project_x" with the_goal of creating new_technologies that will enable the_government to better understand and map the_cyber_territory.
ultimately giving the_department of defense the_ability to plan and manage large-scale_cyber_missions across dynamic_network_environments.

politics is the_process by which groups of people make decisions.
although the_term is generally applied to behavior within civil_governments, politics is observed in all_human_group_interactions, including corporate,_academic,_and_religious_institutions.
politics consists of "social_relations involving authority or power.
the_definition of "politics" from "the_free_dictionary" is the_study of political_behavior and examines the_acquisition and application of power.
politics_study include political_philosophy, which seeks a_rationale for politics and an_ethic of public_behavior, and public_administration, which examines the_practices of governance.

the_korean_people's_army (kpa; korean: 조선인민군; hanja: 朝鮮人民軍; chosŏn-inmin'gun; lit. '
korean_people's_military"') are the_military_forces of north_korea and the_armed_wing of the_workers'_party of north_korea.
under the_songun_policy, it is the_central_institution of north_korean_society.
kim_jong-un serves as supreme_commander and the_chairman of the_central_military_commission.
the_kpa consists of five_branches: the_ground_force, the_naval_force, the_air_and_anti-air_force, the_strategic_rocket_forces, and the_special_operation_force.
the_kpa considers  the_kpa primary adversaries to be the republic of korea armed forces and united states forces korea, across the korean demilitarized zone, as  the_kpa has since the_armistice_agreement of july 1953.
as of 2016, with 5,889,000_paramilitary_personnel, it is the_largest_military_organisation in the_world.
this numbers 25% of the_north_korean_population.
history == ===
korean_people's_revolutionary_army 1932–1948 ===
kim_il-sung's_anti-japanese_guerrilla_army, the_korean_people's_revolutionary_army, was established on 25_april 1932.
this_revolutionary_army was transformed into the_regular_army on 8_february 1948.
both these are celebrated as army_days, with decennial_anniversaries treated as major_celebrations, except from 1978 to 2014 when only_the_1932_anniversary was celebrated.
korean_volunteer_army
1939–1948 ===
in 1939, the_korean_volunteer_army (kva), was formed in yan'an, china.
the_two_individuals responsible for korean_volunteer_army were kim_tu-bong and mu_chong.
at the_same_time, a_school was established near yan'an for training military_and_political_leaders for a_future_independent_korea.
by 1945, the_kva had grown to approximately_1,000_men, mostly_korean_deserters from the_imperial_japanese_army.
during this_period, the_kva fought alongside the_chinese_communist_forces from which the_kva drew the_kva arms and ammunition.
after the_defeat of the_japanese, the_kva accompanied the_chinese_communist_forces into eastern_jilin, intending to gain recruits from ethnic_koreans in china, particularly from yanbian, and then enter korea.
soviet_korean_units ===
just after world_war_ii and during the_soviet_union's_occupation of the_part of korea_north of the_38th_parallel, the_soviet_25th_army_headquarters in pyongyang issued a_statement ordering all_armed_resistance_groups in the_northern_part of the_peninsula to disband on 12_october 1945.
two_thousand_koreans with previous_experience in the_soviet_army were sent to various_locations around the_country to organise constabulary_forces with permission from soviet_military_headquarters, and the_force was created on 21_october 1945.
formation of national_army ===
the_headquarters felt a_need for a_separate_unit for security around railways, and the_formation of a_separate_unit for security around railways was announced on 11 january 1946.
a_separate_unit for security around railways was activated on 15_august of the_same_year to supervise existing_security_forces and creation of the_national_armed_forces.
military_institutes such as the_pyongyang_academy (became no.
2_kpa_officers_school in jan. 1949) and the_central_constabulary_academy (became kpa_military_academy in dec. 1948) soon followed for the_education of political_and_military_officers for the_national_armed_forces.
after the_military was organised and facilities to educate the_military new recruits were constructed, the_constabulary_discipline_corps was reorganised into the_korean_people's_army_general_headquarters.
the_previously_semi-official_units became military_regulars with the_distribution of soviet_uniforms, badges, and weapons that followed the_inception of the_headquarters.
the_state_security_department, a_forerunner to the ministry of people's defense, was created as part of the interim people's committee on 4_february 1948.
the_formal_creation of the_korean_people's_army was announced four days later on 8_february, the day after the_fourth_plenary_session of the_people's_assembly approved the_plan to separate the_roles of the_military and those of the_police, seven months before the_government of the_democratic_people's_republic of korea was proclaimed on 9_september 1948.
in addition, the_ministry of state for the_people's_armed_forces was established, which controlled a_central_guard_battalion, two_divisions, and an_independent_mixed_and_combined_arms_brigade.
conflicts and events ===
before the_outbreak of the_korean_war, joseph_stalin equipped the_kpa with modern_tanks, trucks, artillery, and small_arms (at the_time, the_south_korean_army had nothing remotely comparable either in numbers of troops or equipment).
during the_opening_phases of the_korean_war in 1950, the_kpa quickly drove south_korean_forces south and captured seoul, only to lose 70,000 of south_korean_forces 100,000-strong_army in the_autumn after u.s._amphibious_landings at the_battle of incheon and a_subsequent_drive to the_yalu_river.
on 4_november, china openly staged a_military_intervention.
on 7_december, kim_il-sung was deprived of the_right of command of the_kpa by china.
the_kpa subsequently played a_secondary_minor_role to chinese_forces in the_remainder of the_conflict.
by the_time of the_armistice in 1953,  the_kpa had sustained 290,000_casualties and lost 90,000_men as pows.
in 1953, the_military_armistice_commission (mac) was able to oversee and enforce the_terms of the_armistice.
the_military_armistice_commission (mac), made up of delegations from czechoslovakia, poland, sweden and switzerland, carried out inspections to ensure implementation of the_terms of the_armistice that prevented reinforcements or new_weapons being brought into korea.
soviet_thinking on the_strategic_scale was replaced since december 1962 with a_people's_war_concept.
the_soviet_idea of direct_warfare was replaced with a_maoist_war of attrition_strategy.
along with the_mechanisation of some_infantry_units, more_emphasis was put on light_weapons, high-angle_indirect_fire, night_fighting, and sea_denial.
date of establishment_history ==
until 1977, original_korean_people's_army's_official_date of establishment was 8_february 1948.
but in 1978, changed to 25_april 1932, kim_il-sung's_anti-japanese_guerrilla_army – korean_people's_revolutionary_army, considered the predecessor of the_korean_people's_army, was formed on 25_april 1932.
the_date of establishment was officially changed back to 8 february 1948 by 2019, however.
organization == ===
commission and leadership ===
the_primary_path for command and control of the_kpa extends through the_national_defence_commission which was led by the_kpa chairman kim_jong-il until 2011, to the_ministry of defence and the_ministry of defence general staff department.
from there on, command and control flows to the_various_bureaus and operational_units.
a_secondary_path, to ensure political_control of the_military_establishment, extends through the_workers'_party of korea's_central_military_commission of the_workers'_party of korea.
since 1990, numerous_and_dramatic_transformations within the_dprk have led to the_current_command_and_control_structure.
the_details of the_majority of these_changes are simply unknown to the_world.
what little is known indicates that many_changes were the_natural_result of the_deaths of the_aging_leadership including kim_il-sung (july 1994), minister of people's_armed_forces o_chin-u (february 1995) and minister of defence choi kwang (february 1997).
the_vast_majority of changes were undertaken to secure the_power and position of kim_jong-il.
formerly_the_state_affairs_commission, from the_state_affairs_commission founding in 1972 (originally_the_national_defence_commission), was part of the_central_people's_committee (cpc) while the_ministry of defence, from 1982 onward, was under direct_presidential_control.
at the_eighteenth_session of the_sixth_central_people's_committee, held on 23_may 1990, the_sac became established as the_sac own_independent_commission, rising to the_same_status as the_cpc (now_the_cabinet of north_korea) and not subordinated to the_sac, as was the_case before.
concurrent with this, kim_jong-il was appointed first vice-chairman of the_state_affairs_commission.
the following year, on 24_december 1991, kim_jong-il was appointed supreme commander of the_korean_people's_army.
four months later, on 20_april 1992, kim_jong-il was awarded the_rank of marshal and kim_jong-il father, in virtue of being the_kpa's_founding_commander in chief, became grand marshal as a_result and one year later kim_jong-il became the_chairman of the_state_affairs_commission, by now under supreme_people's_assembly_control under the_then_1992_constitution as amended.
almost_all_officers of the_kpa began almost_all_officers of the_kpa military careers as privates; only_very_few_people are admitted to a_military_academy without prior_service.
the_results is an_egalitarian_military_system where officers are familiar with the_life of a_military_private and "military_nobility" is all but nonexistent.
within the_kpa, between december 1991 and december 1995, nearly_800_high_officers (out of approximately 1,200) received promotions and preferential_assignments.
three days after kim_jong-il became marshal, eight_generals were appointed to the_rank of vice-marshal.
in april 1997, on the_85th_anniversary of kim_il-sung's_birthday, kim_jong-il promoted 127_general_and_admiral_grade_officers.
the_following_april
kim_jong-il ordered the_promotions of another_22_generals and flag_officers.
along with these_changes, many_kpa_officers were appointed to influential_positions within the_korean_workers'_party.
the_promotions of another_22_generals_and_flag_officers continue today, simultaneous with the_celebration of kim_il-sung's_birthday and the_kpa_anniversary_celebrations every april and since recently in july to honour the_end of the_korean_war.
under kim_jong-il's_leadership, political_officers dispatched from the_party monitored every_move of a_general's_daily_life, according to analysts similar to the_work of soviet_political_commissars during the_early_and_middle_years of the_military_establishment.
today the_kpa exercises full_control of both_the_politburo and the_central_military_commission of the_wpk, the_kpa general political and general staff departments and the_ministry of defence, all having the_kpa representatives with a_minimum_general_officer_rank.
following changes made during the_4th_session of the_13th_supreme_people's_assembly on 29_june 2016, the_state_affairs_commission has overseen the_ministry of defence as part of the_state_affairs_commission systemic responsibilities.
all_members of the_state_affairs_commission have membership_status (regular or alternate) on the_wpk_political_bureau.

conscription and terms of service ===
north_korea has universal_conscription for males and selective_conscription for females with many pre-
and_post-service_requirements.
article 86 of the north korean constitution states: "
national_defence is the_supreme_duty and honour of citizens.
citizens shall defend the_country and serve in the_armed_forces as required by law.
kpa
soldiers serve three_years of military_service in the_kpa, which also runs kpa

every saturday, the_young_red_guards hold mandatory_4-hour_military_training_drills, and have training_activities on and off campus to prepare the_young_red_guards for military_service when the_young_red_guards turn 18 or after graduation, as well as for contingency_measures in peacetime.
under the_ministry of social_security and the_wartime_control of the_ministry of defence, and formerly_the_korean_people's_security_forces, the_korean_people's_internal_security_forces forms the_national_gendarmerie and civil_defence_force of kpa
.
the_kpisf has the_kpisf units in various_fields like civil_defence, traffic_management, civil_disturbance_control, and local_security.
the_kpisf has the_kpisf own special_forces_units.
the_service shares the_ranks of kpa
 (with the_exception of marshals) but wears different_uniforms.
budget and commercial_interests ===
kpa
's_annual_budget is approximately us$6 billion.
in 2009, the_u.s._institute for science and international_security reported that north_korea may possess fissile_material for around_two_to_nine_nuclear_warheads.
the north korean songun (military_first") policy elevates
kpa
 to the_primary_position in the_government and society.
according to north_korea_state_news_agency, military_expenditures for 2010 made up 15.8_percent of the_state_budget.
most_analyses of north_korea_defence_sector, however, estimate that defence_spending constitutes between one-quarter and one-third of all_government_spending.
as of 2003, according to the_international_institute of strategic_studies, north_korea's_defence_budget consumed some_25_percent of central_government_spending.
in the_mid-1970s and early_1980s, according to figures released by the_polish_arms_control_and_disarmament_agency, between 32_and_38_percent of central_government_expenditures went towards defence.
north_korea sells missiles and military_equipment to many_countries worldwide.
in april 2009, the_united_nations named the_korea_mining_and_development_trading_corporation (komid) as north_korea's_primary_arms_dealer and main_exporter of equipment related to ballistic_missiles and conventional_weapons.
the_united_nations also named korea_ryonbong as a_supporter of north_korea's_military_related_sales.
historically, north_korea has assisted a_vast_number of revolutionary,_insurgent_and_terrorist_groups in more_than_62_countries.
a_cumulative_total of more_than_5,000_foreign_personnel have been trained in north_korea, and over_7,000_military_advisers, primarily from the_reconnaissance_general_bureau, have been dispatched to some_forty-seven_countries.
some of the_organisations which received north_korean_aid include the_polisario_front, janatha_vimukthi_peramuna, the_communist_party of thailand, the_palestine_liberation_organization and the_islamic_revolutionary_guard_corps.
the_zimbabwean_fifth_brigade received the_zimbabwean_fifth_brigade initial training from kpa_instructors.
north_korean_troops allegedly saw combat during the_libyan–egyptian_war and the_angolan_civil_war.
up_to_200_kpaf_pilots took part in the_vietnam_war, scoring several_kills against us_aircraft.
two_kpa_anti-aircraft_artillery_regiments were sent to north_vietnam as well.
north_korean_instructors trained hezbollah_fighters in guerrilla_warfare_tactics around 2004, prior to the_vietnam_war.

service_branches == ===
ground_force ===
ground_force ==
is the_main_branch of the_korean_people's_army responsible for land-based_military_operations.
it is the_de_facto_army of north_korea.
naval_force ===
naval_force === is organized into two_fleets which are not able to support each other.
the_east_fleet is headquartered at t'oejo-dong and the_west_fleet at nampho.
a_number of training,_shipbuilding_and_maintenance_units and a_naval_air_wing_report directly to naval_command_headquarters at pyongyang.
the_majority of the_navy's_ships are assigned to the_east_fleet.
due to the_short_range of most_ships, the_two_fleets are not known to have ever conducted joint_operations or shared_vessels.
air and anti-air force ===
the_korean_people's_army_air and anti-air_force (kpaaf) is also responsible for north_korea's_air_defence_forces through the_use of anti-aircraft_artillery and surface-to-air missiles (sam).
while much of the_equipment is outdated, the_high_saturation of multilayered,_overlapping,_mutually_supporting_air_defence_sites provides a_formidable_challenge to enemy_air_attacks.
strategic_rocket_force ===
strategic_rocket_force ==
is a_major_division of the_kpa that controls the_dprk's_nuclear_and_conventional_strategic_missiles.
strategic_rocket_force === is mainly equipped with surface-to-surface missiles of soviet_and_chinese_design, as well as locally_developed_long-range_missiles.
special_operation_force ===
the_korean_people's_army_special_operation_force (kpasof) is an_asymmetric_force with a_total_troop_size of 200,000.
since the_korean_war (north_korea: the_korean_war of liberation), the_korean_war (north_korea: the_korean_war of liberation) has continued to play a_role of concentrating infiltration of troops into the_territory of the_republic of south_korea and conducting sabotage.
capabilities ==
after the_korean_war, north_korea maintained a powerful, but smaller_military_force than that of north_korea.
in 1967 the_kpa_forces of about 345,000 were much smaller than the_south_korean_ground_forces of about 585,000.
north_korea_relative_isolation and economic_plight starting from the 1980s has now tipped the_balance of military_power into the_hands of the_better-equipped_south_korean_military.
in response to this_predicament, north_korea relies on asymmetric_warfare_techniques and unconventional_weaponry to achieve parity against high-tech_enemy_forces.
north_korea is reported to have developed a_wide_range of technologies towards this_end, such as stealth_paint to conceal ground_targets, midget_submarines and human_torpedoes, blinding laser_weapons, and probably has a_chemical_weapons_program and is likely to possess a_stockpile of chemical_weapons.
the_korean_people's_army operates zm-87_anti-personnel_lasers, which are banned under the_united_nations_protocol on blinding_laser_weapons.
since the_1980s, north_korea has also been actively developing north_korea own cyber warfare capabilities.
as of 2014, the_secretive_bureau 121 – the_elite_north_korean_cyber_warfare_unit – comprises approximately_1,800_highly_trained_hackers.
in december 2014, the_secretive_bureau 121 – the_elite_north_korean_cyber_warfare_unit – was accused of hacking sony and making threats, leading to the_cancellation of the_interview, a_political_satire_comedy_film based on the_assassination of kim_jong-un.
the_korean_people's_army has also made advances in electronic_warfare by developing gps_jammers.
current_models include vehicle-mounted_jammers with a_range of 50_kilometres (31_mi)-100_kilometres (62_mi).
jammers with a_range of more_than_100_km are being developed, along with electromagnetic_pulse_bombs.
the_korean_people's_army has also made attempts to jam south_korean_military_satellites.
north_korea does not have satellites capable of obtaining satellite_imagery useful for military_purposes, and appears to use imagery from foreign_commercial_platforms.
despite the_general_fuel_and_ammunition_shortages for training, it is estimated that the_wartime_strategic_reserves of food for the_army are sufficient to feed the_regular_troops for 500_days, while fuel and ammunition – amounting to 1.5_million_and_1.7_million_tonnes respectively – are sufficient to wage a_full-scale_war for 100_days.
the_kpa does not operate aircraft_carriers, but has other_means of power_projection.
korean_people's_air_force_il-76md_aircraft provide a_strategic_airlift_capacity of 6,000_troops, while the_navy's_sea_lift_capacity amounts to 15,000_troops.
the_strategic_rocket_forces operate more_than_1,000_ballistic_missiles according to south_korean_officials in 2010, although the_u.s._department of defense reported in 2012 that north_korea has fewer_than_200_missile_launchers.
north_korea acquired 12_foxtrot_class_and_golf-ii_class_missile_submarines as scrap in 1993.
some_analysts suggest that these have either been refurbished with the_help of russian_experts or their_launch_tubes have been reverse-engineered and externally fitted to regular_submarines or cargo_ships.
however globalsecurity reports that the_submarines were rust-eaten_hulks with the_launch_tubes inactivated under russian_observation before delivery, and the_u.s._department of defense does not list them as active.
a_photograph of kim_jong-un receiving a_briefing from kim_jong-un top generals on 29_march 2013 showed a_list that purported to show that the_military had a_minimum of 40_submarines, 13_landing_ships, 6_minesweepers, 27_support_vessels and 1,852_aircraft.
the_korean_people's_army operates a_very_large_amount of equipment, including 4,100_tanks, 2,100_apcs, 8,500_field_artillery_pieces, 5,100_multiple_rocket_launchers, 11,000_air_defence_guns and some_10,000_manpads and anti-tank_guided_missiles in the_ground_force; about_500_vessels in the_navy and 730_combat_aircraft in the_air_force, of which 478 are fighters and 180 are bombers.
north_korea also has the_largest_special_forces in the_world, as well as the_largest_submarine_fleet.
the_equipment is a_mixture of world_war_ii_vintage_vehicles and small_arms, widely proliferated cold_war_technology, and more modern soviet or locally_produced_weapons.
north_korea possesses a_vast_array of long_range_artillery in shelters just north of the_korean_demilitarized_zone.
north_korea has been a_long-standing_cause for concern that a_preemptive_strike_or_retaliatory_strike on seoul using this_arsenal of artillery north of the_korean_demilitarized_zone would lead to a_massive_loss of life in seoul.
estimates on how_many_people would die in an_attack on seoul vary.
when the_clinton_administration mobilised forces over the_reactor at yongbyon in 1994, planners concluded that retaliation by north_korea against seoul could kill 40,000_people.
other_estimates projects hundreds_of_thousands or possibly_millions of fatalities if north_korea uses chemical_munitions.
military_equipment == ===
weapons ===
the_kpa possess a_variety of chinese_and_soviet_sourced_equipment and weaponry, as well as locally_produced_versions and improvements of the former.
soldiers are mostly armed with indigenous_kalashnikov-type_rifles as the_standard_issue_weapon.
front_line_troops are issued the_type 88, while the_older_type_58_assault_rifle and type_68a/b have been shifted to rear_echelon_or_home_guard_units.
a_rifle of unknown_nomenclature was seen during the_2017_'day of the_sun'_military_parade, appearing to consist of a_grenade_launcher and a_standard_assault_rifle, similar to the u.s oicw or south korean s&t daewoo k11.
north_korea generally designates rifles as "type_xx", similar to the_chinese_naming_system.
on 15_november 2018, north_korea successfully tested a_"newly_developed_ultramodern_tactical_weapon".
leader_kim_jong-un observed the_test at the academy of defense science and called the_test at the academy of defense science a "decisive turn" in bolstering the_combat_power of the_north_korean_army.
there is a_korean_people's_army_military_hardware_museum located in pyongyang that displays a_range of the_equipment used.
chemical_weapons ===
the_u.s._department of defense believes north_korea probably has a_chemical_weapons_program and is likely to possess a_stockpile of such_weapons.
nuclear_capabilities ====
north_korea has tested a_series of different_missiles, including short-, medium-, intermediate-, and intercontinental-_range, and submarine-launched_ballistic_missiles.
estimates of north_korea's_nuclear_stockpile vary: some_experts believe pyongyang has between fifteen_and_twenty_nuclear_weapons, while u.s._intelligence believes the_number to be between thirty_and_sixty_bombs.
the_regime conducted two_tests of an_intercontinental_ballistic_missile (icbm) capable of carrying a_large_nuclear_warhead in july 2017.
the_pentagon confirmed north_korea's_icbm_tests, and analysts estimate that the_new_missile has a_potential_range of 10,400_kilometres (6,500_mi) and, if fired on a_flatter_trajectory, could be capable of reaching mainland_u.s._territory.
nuclear_tests ===
on 9_october 2006, the_north_korean_government announced that the_north_korean_government had unsuccessfully attempted a_nuclear_test for the_first_time.
experts at the_united_states_geological_survey and japanese_seismological_authorities detected an_earthquake with a_preliminary_estimated_magnitude of 4.3 from the_site in north_korea, proving the_official_claims to be true.
north_korea also went on to claim that north_korea had developed a_nuclear_weapon in 2009.
north_korea is widely believed to possess a_stockpile of relatively_simple_nuclear_weapons.
the_iaea has met ri_je-son, the_director_general of the_general_department of atomic_energy (gdae) of north_korea, to discuss nuclear_matters.
ri_je_son was also mentioned in this_role in 2002 in a_united_nations_article.
on 3_september 2017, the_north_korean_leadership announced that the_north_korean_leadership had conducted a_nuclear_test with what the_north_korean_leadership claimed to be the_north_korean_leadership first hydrogen bomb detonation.
its_first_hydrogen_bomb_detonation took place at an_underground_location at the_punggye-ri_nuclear_test_site in north_hamgyong_province at 12:00_pm local_time.
south_korean_officials claimed a_nuclear_test yielded 50_kilotons of explosive_force, with many_international_observers claiming a_nuclear_test likely involved some_form of a_thermonuclear_reaction.

the_mk_153_shoulder-launched_multipurpose_assault_weapon (smaw) is a_shoulder-launched_rocket_weapon with the_primary_function of being a_portable_assault_weapon (e.g._bunker_buster) and a_secondary_anti-armor_rocket_launcher.
developed from the b-300, it was introduced to the_united_states_armed_forces in 1984.
it has a_maximum_effective_range of 500_metres (550_yd) against a_tank-sized_target.
it can be used to destroy bunkers and other_fortifications during assault_operations; it can also destroy other_designated_targets using the_dual_mode_rocket and main_battle_tanks using the_high-explosive_anti-tank_rocket.
operations in afghanistan and iraq saw a_thermobaric_rocket added (described as a "novel explosive" [ne]), which is capable of collapsing a_building.
service_history ==
the_smaw_system (launcher, ammunition and logistics support) was fielded in 1984 as a_united_states_marine_corps–unique_system.
the_mod 0 demonstrated several_shortcomings, resulting in a_series of modifications in the_mid-2000s.
modifications in the_mid-2000s included a_re-sleeving_process for bubbled_launch_tubes, rewriting/drafting_operator and technical_manuals, and a kit to reduce environmental_intrusion into the_trigger_mechanism.
this also includes an_optical_sight_modification to allow the_high-explosive_anti-armor_(heaa)_rocket to be used effectively against moving armor_targets.
the_u.s._armed_forces fielded boresight_bracket_kits which correct the_loss of accurate_boresight_issues between the_launch_tube and spotting rifle.
during operation_desert_storm, 150_launchers and 5,000_rockets were deployed by the_united_states_army.
initially the_united_states_army the_united_states_army showed interest in the_system but ultimately returned the_launchers and any_unused_rockets to the_marine_corps.
later, the_united_states_army developed the smaw-d ("disposable"), designated by the_united_states_army as the_m141_bunker_defeat_munition.
follow-on to smaw ===
in 2002, the_corps began a_program to develop a_successor to the_smaw_system, tentatively titled "follow-on to smaw".
the_contract was awarded to lockheed_martin and israel_military_industries (imi); this resulted in the_enhanced_fgm-172_sraw.
in combat_operations, this was ultimately used to augment, rather than replace, the_smaw_system.
smaw_ii_program ==
in 2008, a_replacement_program was again initiated and titled the_smaw_ii.
a_replacement_program was developed in tandem with a_round capable of being fired from an_enclosed_area without ill_effects on the_environment and personnel.
a_replacement_program_combined_weight is 13.5_kilograms (29.7
lb)—5.3_kg (11.7_lb) for the_launcher, 8.2_kg (18_lb) for the_rocket.
the_contract was worth up to us$51.7 million ===
smaw_ii_serpent ==
in 2012, raytheon_missile_systems developed a_smaw_ii_launcher called "serpent, and nammo_talley developed new_rounds for smaw_ii_serpent ==.
smaw_ii_serpent == is similar in many_respects to the_first_smaw_launcher, except that smaw_ii_serpent == replaces the_standard_smaw_launcher's_spotting_gun with sophisticated_fire_control_electronics.
the_sighting_unit on the_launcher is enclosed in a_unique_roll-cage to protect the_launcher.
a_unique_roll-cage also serves as a_carry_handle.
the_development reduced the_over-all_weight by four_and_a_half_pounds (2.0_kg) from the_launcher.
the_serpent fires the_same_rounds as the_standard_smaw and supports new_and_improved/enhanced_rounds.
compared to the_israel_military_industries'_b-300_weapon that it was developed from, the_smaw has slower_projectile_velocities, the_smaw and the_smaw ammunition are both heavier, and it takes a_second_crew_member to keep up with the_b-300's_rate-of-fire, but some of the_smaw projectile options have longer ranges than
the b-300.
the_smaw has an_83.5_millimetres (3.29 in) diameter_tube and fires 83-millimetre (3.3 in)_rockets.
the_smaw is a_man-portable_weapon_system consisting of the_mk_153_launcher, the mk 3 mod 0 encased high-explosive,_dual-purpose_(hedp) rocket, the_mk_6_mod_0_encased_high-explosive,_anti-armor_(heaa)_rocket, the_mk_7_mod_0_common_encased_practice_rocket, the_mk_80_mod_0_encased_novel_explosive_(ne)_rocket, and the_mk_217_mod_0_spotting_rifle_cartridge.
the_launcher consists of the_launch_tube, spotting rifle, electro-mechanical_firing_mechanism, mounting_brackets, open_battle_sights and a_mount for the_mk_42_mod_0_day_sight or an/pvs-4 or an/pvs-17b_night_sights.
the_launch_tube is made of fiberglass-epoxy_composite_material with a_gelcoat on the_bore.
the_spotting_rifle is mounted on the_right_side of the_launch_tube.
the_spotting_rifle_functions semi-automatically by primer_actuation, meaning that when fired the_primer_sets back and unlocks the_breech of the_spotting_rifle, ejecting the_spent_round.
the_firing_mechanism mechanically fires the_spotting_rifle and uses a_magnet to fire the_rocket.
the_mounting_brackets connect the_components and provide the_means for boresighting the_weapon, while the_encased_rockets are loaded at the_rear of the_launcher.
the_spotting_cartridges are stored in a_magazine in the_cap of the_rocket.
the_9×51mm_mk_217_spotting_round is ballistically matched to the_rocket and serves to increase the_gunner's_first-round_hit_probability.
each_round consists of a_special_9_mm_projectile which contains a_tracer_compound, crimped into a_7.62×51mm_nato casing with a_.22_hornet_primer.
the_system can be used in conjunction with the_an_/peq-2_aiming_light in place of the_spotting_rifle.
as with all of these_types of recoilless_rocket_weapons, the_backblast that is created when the_system is fired is a_primary_safety_concern.
when the_rocket is fired, the_rocket propellant is expended entirely within the_rocket encasement.
this is the_cause of the_extremely_loud_and_violent_backblast.
this_backblast extends in a_90-meter,_60°_cone to the_rear of the_weapon.
this_backblast is lethal out to 30_metres (98_ft) and still extremely dangerous to 90_metres (300 ft).
an_assistant_gunner is often used during employment of the_weapon_system to monitor the_backblast_area and clear the_backblast_area of fellow_troops, or to notify the_gunner of obstructions that could reflect the_force of this_backblast back at the_gun_team.
the_gunner is only cleared to launch a_rocket when  the_gunner hears the_command_"backblast_area secure" from  the_gunner assistant gunner.
rounds are under development that would enable a_user to fire a_rocket from an_enclosed_building without risk of injury.
the_mk 153 mod 2 is an_enhanced_variant, featuring an_electronic_modular_ballistic_sight (mbs) in place of the_9_mm_spotting_system.
the_mbs has a_laser_rangefinder_and_thermal_weapon_sight to provide a_firing_solution using a_displaced_reticle, where crosshairs are adjusted for distance and environmental_factors; it is lighter, more reliable, and can be detached from the_launcher.
while the_mod 0 weighs 7.5_kg (16.5_lb), the_mod 2 weighs 5.9_kg (13_lb) with the_mbs attached, and 3.9_kg (8.5_lb) with the_mbs the_mbs detached.
other_improvements include increased_pad_size on the_forward_grip and foldable_backup_iron_sights.
the_mod_2_systems were expected to replace the_existing_inventory by october 2020.
rockets ===
the mk 4 mod 0 encased high-explosive, anti-armor, practice_rocket is used in training.
the_warhead consists of a_blue_plastic_projectile attached to a_rocket_motor similar to the_hedp_rocket.
the_hedp_rocket has no_explosive_capability against the_target except for kinetic_energy.
upon impact against a_target, the plastic warhead ruptures, dispensing an_inert_white_spotting_powder.
the_mk_3_mod 0
encased_hedp_rocket is effective against bunkers, masonry and concrete_walls and light_armor.
initiated by a_crush_switch in its_nose, the_hedp_rocket is able to distinguish between hard_and_soft_targets resulting in greater_penetration into soft_targets for increased_damage_potential.
the_hedp_round is capable of penetrating 20_centimetres (7.9 in) of concrete, 30_centimetres (12 in) of brick or up_to_210_centimetres (6.9_ft) of wood-reinforced_sandbags.
the_mk_6_mod_0_encased_high-explosive,_anti-armor_(heaa)_rocket is effective against current_tanks without additional_armor and utilizes a_standoff_rod on the_detonator, allowing the_explosive_force to be focused on a_small_point and for maximum_damage against armored_targets.
the_heaa_round is capable of penetrating up to the_equivalent of 600_mm of rolled_homogeneous_steel.
the_mk_80_mod_0_encased_novel_explosive_(smaw-ne)_rocket is effective against caves and bunkers.
the_smaw-ne has a_4lb_charge of pbxih-135, an_enhanced-blast_warhead.
the_indian_head_naval_surface_warfare_center teamed with marine_corps_systems_command and talley_defense_systems to respond to an_urgent_u.s._marine_corps need for a_shoulder-launched_enhanced-blast_warhead in 2003.
the_indian_head_naval_surface_warfare_center was used in combat during both_the_first_and_second_offensives in fallujah, in 2004.

shielded_metal_arc_welding (smaw), also known as manual_metal_arc_welding (mma or mmaw), flux shielded arc_welding or informally_as_stick welding, is a manual arc_welding process that uses a_consumable_electrode covered with a_flux to lay the_weld.
an_electric_current, in the_form of either alternating current_or_direct_current from a_welding_power_supply, is used to form an_electric_arc between the_electrode and the_metals to be joined.
the_workpiece and the_electrode melts forming a_pool of molten_metal (weld_pool)
that cools to form a_joint.
as the_weld is laid, the_flux_coating of the_electrode disintegrates, giving off vapors that serve as a_shielding_gas and providing a_layer of slag, both of which protect the_weld area from atmospheric_contamination.
because of the_versatility of the_process and the_simplicity of the_process equipment and operation, shielded_metal_arc_welding is one of the_world's_first_and_most_popular_welding_processes.
the_process dominates other_welding_processes in the_maintenance_and_repair_industry, and though flux-cored_arc_welding is growing in popularity, smaw continues to be used extensively in the_construction of heavy_steel_structures and in industrial_fabrication.
the_process is used primarily to weld iron and steels (including stainless_steel) but aluminium, nickel and copper_alloys can also be welded with this_method.
development ==
after the_discovery of the_short_pulsed_electric_arc in 1800 by humphry_davy and of the_continuous_electric_arc in 1802 by vasily_petrov, there was little_development in electrical_welding until auguste_de_méritens developed a_carbon_arc_torch that was patented in 1881.in 1885, nikolay_benardos and stanisław_olszewski developed carbon_arc_welding, obtaining american_patents from 1887 showing a_rudimentary_electrode_holder.
in 1888, the_consumable_metal_electrode was invented by nikolay_slavyanov.
later in 1890, c._l._coffin received u.s._patent 428,459 for c._l._coffin arc welding method that utilized a_metal_electrode.
the_process, like smaw, deposited melted electrode metal into the_weld as filler.
around 1900, arthur_percy_strohmenger and oscar_kjellberg released the_first_coated_electrodes.
arthur_percy_strohmenger used clay and lime_coating to stabilize the_arc, while oscar_kjellberg dipped iron_wire into mixtures of carbonates and silicates to coat the_electrode.
in 1912, arthur_percy_strohmenger released a_heavily_coated_electrode, but high_cost and complex_production_methods prevented the_first_coated_electrodes from gaining popularity.
in 1927, the_development of an_extrusion_process reduced the_cost of coating_electrodes while allowing manufacturers to produce more_complex_coating_mixtures designed for specific_applications.
in the_1950s, manufacturers introduced iron_powder into the_flux_coating, making it possible to increase the_welding_speed.
in 1945 karl_kristian_masden described an_automated_variation of smaw, now known as gravity_welding.
it briefly gained popularity in the_1960s after receiving publicity for it use in japanese_shipyards though today
it_applications are limited.
another_little_used_variation of the_process, known as firecracker_welding, was developed around the_same_time by george_hafergut in austria.
in 1964 laser_welding was developed in bell_laboratory with the_intention of using this_technology as a_communication_tool.
due to the_large_force of energy coupled with the_small_area of focus, laser_welding became a_powerful_heat_source for cutting and tooling.
operation ==
to strike the_electric_arc, the_electrode is brought into contact with the_workpiece by a_very_light_touch of the_electrode to the_base_metal.
the_electrode is then pulled back slightly.
this initiates the_arc and thus_the_melting of the_workpiece and the_consumable_electrode, and causes droplets of the_electrode to be passed from the_electrode to the_weld_pool.
striking an_arc, which varies widely based upon electrode_and_workpiece_composition, can be the_hardest_skill for beginners.
the_orientation of the_electrode to workpiece is where most stumble, if the_electrode is held at a_perpendicular_angle to the_workpiece the_tip will likely stick to the_metal which will fuse the_electrode to the_workpiece which will cause the_electrode to heat up very rapidly.
the_tip of the_electrode needs to be at a_lower_angle to the_workpiece, which allows the_weld_pool to flow out of the_arc.
as the_electrode melts, the_flux covering disintegrates, giving off shielding gases that protect the_weld_area from oxygen and other_atmospheric_gases.
in addition, the_flux covering provides molten_slag which covers the_filler as the_flux covering travels from electrode to the_weld_pool.
once part of the_weld_pool, the_slag floats to the_surface and protects the_weld from contamination as the_weld solidifies.
once hardened, the_weld must be chipped away to reveal the_weld.
as welding progresses and the_electrode melts, the_welder must periodically stop welding to remove the_remaining_electrode_stub and insert a_new_electrode into the_electrode holder.
this_activity, combined with chipping away the_slag, reduces the_amount of time that the_welder can spend laying the_weld, making smaw one of the_least_efficient_welding_processes.
in general, the_operator_factor, or the_percentage of operator's_time spent laying weld, is approximately_25%.the_actual_welding_technique utilized depends on a_new_electrode,
the_composition of the_workpiece, and the_position of the joint being welded.
the_choice of electrode_and_welding_position also determine the_welding_speed.
flat_welds require the_least_operator_skill, and can be done with electrodes that melt quickly but solidify slowly.
this permits higher_welding_speeds.
sloped, vertical_or_upside-down_welding requires more_operator_skill, and often necessitates the_use of an_electrode that solidifies quickly to prevent the_molten_metal from flowing out of the_weld_pool.
however, this generally means that the_electrode melts less quickly, thus increasing the_time required to lay the_weld.
quality ===
the_most_common_quality_problems associated with smaw include weld_spatter, porosity, poor_fusion, shallow_penetration, and cracking.
weld_spatter, while not affecting the_integrity of the_weld, damages weld_spatter_appearance and increases cleaning_costs.
secondary_finishing_services are often required due to the_aesthetic_appearance caused by the_occurrence of molten_splatter.
it can be caused by excessively_high_current, a_long_arc, or arc_blow, a condition associated with direct_current characterized by the_electric_arc being deflected away from the_weld_pool by magnetic_forces.
arc_blow can also cause porosity in the_weld, as can joint_contamination, high_welding_speed, and a_long_welding_arc, especially when low-hydrogen_electrodes are used.
porosity, often not visible without the_use of advanced_nondestructive_testing_methods, is a_serious_concern because a_serious_concern can potentially weaken the_weld.
porosity is caused when the_gaseous_shield did not sufficiently shield the_molten_weld_metal while the_bead is laid or while the_bead is cooling.
what happens is that the_weld_bead is overexposed to and absorbs; nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen from the_atmosphere.
when a_porous_weld cools, the_newly_absorbed_gaseous_molecules are released and the_welder is left with a_porous_weld bead.
another_defect affecting the_strength of a_porous_weld is poor_fusion, though a_porous_weld is often easily visible.
a_porous_weld is caused by low current, contaminated joint_surfaces, or the_use of an_improper_electrode.
shallow_penetration, another_detriment to weld strength, can be addressed by decreasing welding_speed, increasing the current or using a_smaller_electrode.
any of these_weld-strength-related_defects can make the_weld prone to cracking, but other_factors are involved as well.
high_carbon,_alloy_or_sulfur_content in the_base_material can lead to cracking, especially if low-hydrogen_electrodes and preheating are not employed.
furthermore, the_workpieces should not be excessively restrained, as this introduces residual_stresses into the_weld and can cause cracking as the_weld cools and contracts.
safety ===
smaw_welding, like other_welding_methods, can be a_dangerous_and_unhealthy_practice if proper_precautions are not taken.
the_process uses an_open_electric_arc, which presents a_risk of burns which are prevented by personal_protective_equipment in the_form of heavy_leather_gloves and long_sleeve_jackets.
additionally, the_brightness of the_weld_area can lead to a_condition called arc eye, in which ultraviolet_light causes inflammation of the_cornea and can burn the_retinas of the_eyes.
welding_helmets with dark_face_plates are worn to prevent this_exposure, and in recent_years, new_helmet_models have been produced that feature a_face_plate that self-darkens upon exposure to high_amounts of uv_light.
to protect bystanders, especially in industrial_environments, translucent_welding_curtains often surround the_weld_area.
these_curtains, made of a_polyvinyl_chloride_plastic_film, shield nearby_workers from exposure to the_uv_light from the_electric_arc, but should not be used to replace the_filter_glass used in helmets.
in addition, the_vaporizing_metal_and_flux_materials expose welders to dangerous_gases and particulate_matter.
the_smoke produced contains particles of various_types of oxides.
the_size of the_particles in question tends to influence the_toxicity of the_fumes, with smaller_particles presenting a_greater_danger.
additionally, gases like carbon_dioxide and ozone can form, which can prove dangerous if ventilation is inadequate.
some of the_latest_welding_masks are fitted with an_electric_powered_fan to help disperse harmful_fumes.
application and materials ===
shielded_metal_arc_welding is one of the_world's_most_popular_welding_processes, accounting for over_half of shielded_metal_arc_welding in some_countries.
because of its_versatility and simplicity, its is particularly dominant in the_maintenance_and_repair_industry, and is heavily used in the_construction of steel_structures and in industrial_fabrication.
in recent_years its_use has declined as flux-cored_arc_welding has expanded in the_construction_industry_and_gas_metal_arc_welding has become more popular in industrial_environments.
however, because of the_low_equipment_cost and wide_applicability, the_process will likely remain popular, especially among amateurs and small_businesses where specialized_welding_processes are uneconomical and unnecessary.
smaw is often used to weld carbon_steel, low and high alloy_steel, stainless_steel, cast_iron, and ductile_iron.
while less popular for non-ferrous_materials,  smaw can be used on nickel and copper and their_alloys and, in rare_cases, on aluminium.
the_thickness of the_material being welded is bounded on the_low_end primarily by the_skill of the_welder, but rarely does it drop below 1.5_mm (0.06 in).
no upper bound exists: with proper_joint_preparation and use of multiple_passes, materials of virtually_unlimited_thicknesses can be joined.
furthermore, depending on the_electrode used and the_skill of the_welder,  smaw can be used in any_position.
==_equipment ==
shielded_metal_arc_welding_equipment typically consists of a_constant_current_welding_power_supply and an_electrode, with an_electrode holder, a_ground_clamp, and welding_cables (also known as welding_leads) connecting the two.
power supply ===
the_power_supply used in smaw has constant_current_output, ensuring that the current (and thus_the_heat) remains relatively constant, even if the arc distance and voltage change.
this is important because most_applications of smaw are manual, requiring that an_operator hold the_torch.
maintaining a_suitably_steady_arc_distance is difficult if a_constant_voltage_power_source is used instead, since a_constant_voltage_power_source can cause dramatic_heat_variations and make welding more difficult.
however, because the_current is not maintained absolutely_constant,_skilled_welders performing complicated_welds can vary the_arc_length to cause minor_fluctuations in the_current.
the_preferred_polarity of the_smaw_system depends primarily upon the_electrode being used and the_desired_properties of the_weld.
direct_current with a negatively charged electrode (dcen) causes heat to build up on the_electrode, increasing the_electrode melting rate and decreasing the_depth of the_weld.
reversing the_polarity so that the_electrode is positively charged (dcep) and the_workpiece is negatively charged increases the_weld_penetration.
with alternating current the polarity changes over 100 times per second, creating an_even_heat_distribution and providing a_balance between electrode_melting_rate and penetration.
typically, the_equipment used for smaw consists of a_step-down_transformer and for direct_current_models a rectifier, which converts alternating current into direct_current.
because the_power normally supplied to the_welding_machine is high-voltage alternating current, the_welding_transformer is used to reduce the_voltage and increase the_current.
as a_result, instead of 220_v at 50_a, for example, the_power supplied by the_welding_transformer is around 17–45_v at currents up_to_600_a.
a_number of different_types of transformers can be used to produce this_effect, including multiple_coil_and_inverter_machines, with each using a_different_method to manipulate the_welding_current.
the_multiple_coil_type adjusts the_current by either varying the_number of turns in the_coil (in tap-type_transformers) or by varying the_distance between the_primary_and_secondary_coils (in movable_coil or movable_core_transformers).
inverters, which are smaller and thus more portable, use electronic_components to change the_current_characteristics.
electrical_generators and alternators are frequently used as portable_welding_power_supplies, but because of lower_efficiency and greater_costs, electrical_generators and alternators are less frequently used in industry.
maintenance also tends to be more difficult, because of the_complexities of using a_combustion_engine as a_power_source.
however, in one_sense they are simpler: the_use of a_separate_rectifier is unnecessary because they can provide either_ac or dc.
however, the_engine_driven_units are most practical in field_work where the_welding often must be done out of doors and in locations where transformer_type_welders are not usable because there is no_power_source available to be transformed.
in some_units the_alternator is essentially the same as that used in portable_generating_sets used to supply mains_power, modified to produce a_higher_current at a_lower_voltage but still at the_50_or_60_hz_grid_frequency.
in higher-quality_units an_alternator with more_poles is used and supplies current at a_higher_frequency, such as 400_hz.
the_smaller_amount of time the_high-frequency_waveform spends near zero makes it much easier to strike and maintain a_stable_arc than with the_cheaper_grid-frequency_sets or grid-frequency_mains-powered_units.
electrode ===
the_choice of electrode for smaw depends on a_number of factors, including the_weld_material, welding_position and the_desired_weld_properties.
electrode === is coated in a_metal_mixture called flux, which gives off gases as electrode === decomposes to prevent weld_contamination, introduces deoxidizers to purify the_weld, causes weld-protecting_slag to form, improves the_arc_stability, and provides alloying_elements to improve the_weld quality.
electrodes can be divided into three_groups—
those designed to melt quickly are called "fast-fill" electrodes, those designed to solidify quickly are called "fast-freeze" electrodes, and intermediate_electrodes go by the_name_"fill-freeze" or "fast-follow"_electrodes.
fast-fill_electrodes are designed to melt quickly so that the_welding_speed can be maximized, while fast-freeze_electrodes supply filler_metal that solidifies quickly, making welding in a_variety of positions possible by preventing the_weld_pool from shifting significantly before solidifying.
the_composition of the_electrode_core is generally similar and sometimes identical to that of the_base_material.
but even though a_number of feasible_options exist, a_slight_difference in alloy_composition can strongly impact the_properties of the_resulting_weld.
this is especially true of alloy_steels such as hsla_steels.
likewise, electrodes of compositions similar to those of the_base_materials are often used for welding nonferrous_materials like aluminium and copper.
however, sometimes it is desirable to use electrodes with core_materials significantly different from the_base_material.
for example, stainless_steel_electrodes are sometimes used to weld two_pieces of carbon_steel, and are often utilized to weld stainless_steel_workpieces with carbon_steel workpieces.
electrode_coatings can consist of a_number of different_compounds, including rutile, calcium_fluoride, cellulose, and iron_powder.
rutile_electrodes, coated with 25%–45%_tio2, are characterized by ease of use and good_appearance of the_resulting_weld.
however, they create welds with high_hydrogen_content, encouraging embrittlement and cracking.
electrodes containing calcium_fluoride (caf2), sometimes known as basic_or_low-hydrogen_electrodes, are hygroscopic and must be stored in dry_conditions.
electrodes containing calcium_fluoride (caf2), sometimes known as basic_or_low-hydrogen_electrodes produce strong_welds, but with a_coarse_and_convex-shaped_joint_surface.
electrodes coated with cellulose, especially when combined with rutile, provide deep_weld_penetration, but because of electrodes high moisture content, special_procedures must be used to prevent excessive_risk of cracking.
finally, iron_powder is a_common_coating_additive that increases the_rate at which the_electrode fills the_weld joint, up to twice as fast.
to identify different_electrodes, the_american_welding_society established a_system that assigns electrodes with a_four-_or_five-digit_number.
covered_electrodes made of mild_or_low_alloy_steel carry the_prefix_e, followed by their_number.
the_first_two_or_three_digits of their_number specify the_tensile_strength of the_weld_metal, in thousand_pounds per square_inch (ksi).
the_penultimate_digit generally identifies the_welding_positions permissible with the_electrode, typically using the_values 1 (normally_fast-freeze_electrodes, implying all_position_welding) and 2 (normally fast-fill electrodes, implying horizontal_welding only).
the_welding_current and type of electrode_covering are specified by the_last_two_digits together.
when applicable, a_suffix is used to denote the_alloying_element being contributed by the_electrode.
common_electrodes include the_e6010, a_fast-freeze, all-position electrode with a_minimum_tensile_strength of 60_ksi (410_mpa) which is operated using dcep, and provides deep_weld_penetration with a_forceful_arc capable of burning through light_rust or oxides on the_workpiece.
e6011 is similar except e6011 flux coating allows e6011 to be used with alternating current in addition to dcep.
e7024 is a_fast-fill_electrode, used primarily to make flat_or_horizontal_fillet_welds using ac, dcen, or dcep.
examples of fill-freeze_electrodes are the_e6012,_e6013, and e7014, all of which provide a_compromise between fast_welding_speeds and all-position_welding.
process_variations ===
though smaw is almost exclusively a_manual_arc_welding_process, one_notable_process_variation exists, known as gravity_welding or gravity_arc welding.
smaw serves as an_automated_version of the_traditional_shielded_metal_arc_welding_process, employing an_electrode_holder attached to an_inclined_bar along the_length of the_weld.
once started, the_traditional_shielded_metal_arc_welding_process continues until the_electrode is spent, allowing the_operator to manage multiple_gravity_welding_systems.
the_electrodes employed (often e6027 or e7024) are coated heavily in flux, and are typically 71_cm (28 in) in length and about_6.35_mm (0.25 in) thick.
as in manual_smaw, a_constant_current_welding_power_supply is used, with either_negative_polarity direct current or alternating current.
due to a_rise in the_use of semiautomatic_welding_processes such as flux-cored_arc_welding, the_popularity of gravity_welding has fallen as the_popularity of gravity_welding economic advantage over such_methods is often minimal.
other_smaw-related_methods that are even less frequently used include firecracker_welding, an_automatic_method for making butt and fillet welds, and massive_electrode_welding, a_process for welding large_components or structures that can deposit up to 27_kg (60_lb) of weld_metal per hour.

guidelines for shielded_metal_arc_welding (.pdf)
flux-cored_arc_welding (fcaw or fca) is a_semi-automatic_or_automatic_arc_welding_process.
fcaw requires a_continuously-fed_consumable_tubular_electrode containing a_flux and a_constant-voltage or, less_commonly,_a_constant-current_welding_power_supply.
an_externally_supplied_shielding_gas is sometimes used, but often the_flux itself is relied upon to generate the_necessary_protection from the_atmosphere, producing both_gaseous_protection and liquid_slag protecting the_weld.
the_process is widely used in construction because of the_process high_welding_speed and portability.
fcaw was first developed in the_early_1950s as an_alternative to shielded_metal_arc_welding (smaw).
the_advantage of fcaw over smaw is that the_use of the_stick_electrodes used in smaw is unnecessary.
this helped fcaw to overcome many of the_restrictions associated with smaw.
==_types ==
one_type of fcaw requires no_shielding_gas.
this is made possible by the_flux_core in the_tubular_consumable_electrode.
however, the_flux_core in the_tubular_consumable_electrode contains more than just_flux.
the_flux_core in the_tubular_consumable_electrode also contains various_ingredients that when exposed to the_high_temperatures of welding generate a_shielding_gas for protecting the_arc.
this_type of fcaw is attractive because  this_type of fcaw is portable and generally has good_penetration into the_base_metal.
also, windy_conditions need not be considered.
some_disadvantages are that this_process can produce excessive,_noxious_smoke (making it difficult to see the_weld_pool).
as with all_welding_processes, the_proper_electrode must be chosen to obtain the_required_mechanical_properties.
operator_skill is a_major_factor as improper_electrode_manipulation or machine_setup can cause porosity.
another_type of fcaw uses a_shielding_gas that must be supplied by an_external_source.
this is known informally as "dual_shield"_welding.
another_type of fcaw_fcaw was developed primarily for welding structural_steels.
in fact, since  another_type of fcaw uses both_a_flux-cored_electrode and an_external_shielding_gas, one might say that  another_type of fcaw is a_combination of gas_metal (gmaw) and flux-cored arc welding (fcaw).
the most often used shielding gases are either straight carbon dioxide or argon carbon dioxide blends.
the_most_common_blend used is 75%_argon_25%_carbon_dioxide.
this_particular_style of fcaw is preferable for welding thicker and out-of-position metals.
the_slag created by the_flux is also easy to remove.
the_main_advantages of this_process is that in a_closed_shop_environment, this_process generally produces welds of better_and_more_consistent_mechanical_properties, with fewer_weld_defects than either_the_smaw_or_gmaw_processes.
in practice it also allows a_higher_production_rate, since the_operator does not need to stop periodically to fetch a_new_electrode, as is the_case in smaw.
however, like gmaw, gmaw cannot be used in a_windy_environment as the_loss of the_shielding_gas from air_flow will produce porosity in the_weld.
process_variables ==
wire_feed_speed_arc_voltage
electrode_extension_travel_speed_and_angle_electrode_angles_electrode_wire_type_shielding_gas_composition (if required)
reverse_polarity (electrode_positive) is used for fcaw_gas-shielded_wire, straight_polarity (electrode_negative) is used for self_shielded_fcaw_contact_tip to work_distance (ctwd) ==
advantages and applications ==
fcaw may be an_"all-position"_process with the_right_filler_metals (the_consumable_electrode)
no_shielding_gas needed with some_wires making it suitable for outdoor_welding and/or windy_conditions a_high-deposition_rate_process
(speed at which the_filler_metal is applied) in the_1g/1f/2f_some_"high-speed"_(e.g.,_automotive)_applications
as compared to smaw and gtaw, there is less_skill required for operators.
less_precleaning of metal required metallurgical_benefits from the_flux such as the_weld_metal being protected initially from external_factors until the_slag is chipped away porosity chances very low less equipment required, easier to move around (no gas bottle)used on the_following_alloys:
mild_and_low_alloy_steels
stainless_steels some_high_nickel_alloys
some_wearfacing/surfacing_alloys_==_disadvantages ==
of course, all of the_usual_issues that occur in welding can occur in fcaw such as incomplete_fusion between base_metals, slag_inclusion (non-metallic_inclusions), and cracks in the_welds.
but there are a_few_concerns that come up with fcaw that are worth taking special_note of: melted_contact_tip – when the_contact_tip actually contacts the_base_metal, fusing the two and melting the_hole on the_end.
irregular_wire_feed – typically_a_mechanical_problem.
porosity – the_gases (specifically those from the_flux-core) don’t escape the_welded_area before the_base_metal hardens, leaving holes in the_base_metal.
more_costly_filler_material/wire
as compared to gmaw.
the_amount of smoke generated can far exceed that of smaw, gmaw, or gtaw.
changing filler_metals requires changing an_entire_spool.
this can be slow and difficult as compared to changing filler_metal for smaw or gtaw.
creates more_fumes than smaw.

the_m141_bunker_defeat_munition (bdm), or smaw-d ("disposable"), is a_single-shot,_shoulder-launched_weapon designed to defeat hardened_structures.
the_weapon was designed as a_modification of the_united_states_marine_corps shoulder-launched_multipurpose_assault_weapon (smaw) to fill the_void in the_united_states_army_inventory of a_"bunker_buster"_weapon.
service_history ==
two_candidates were evaluated for the_us_army's_bdm_program.
one_candidate from mcdonnell-douglas (later_talley_defense_systems) which used the_same_warhead as the_marine_corps_smaw,
but with a_rocket_motor with a_shorter_burn_time, and another developed by sweden's_ffv for alliant_techsystems (later_honeywell), which replaced the_standard_heat_warhead of the at4/m136 with the_same_dual_purpose_warhead as used by the_usmc_smaw.
ffv designated the_bunker_buster_version of the_at4 as the ffv at8.
in 1996 the_mcdonnell-douglas_candidate was chosen.
in a_unique_move, the_us_army ordered one_batch of 1,500_then_a_second_batch of 4,500 which were placed in contingency_storage for expedited_issue to units in combat.
the_smaw-d was delivered to the_us_army in 1999.the_conferees of the_national_defense_authorization_act for fiscal_year 1994
agreed that the_army's_bdm and the_marine_corps'_sraw were too similar to justify separate_long-term_projects, and that the_army should pursue an_interim_bdm_program.
congress limited bdm_procurement to 6,000_units.
cnn_news_footage showed us_army_rangers firing m141s at various_fortified_caves during the_tora_bora_operations against the_afghan_taliban and al_qaeda, being mistaken by the_cnn_reporters for at4/m136_projectiles.
the_smaw-d operates on the_principle of a_recoilless_rifle, in that the_recoil created by launching the_projectile is counteracted by a_"backblast" of gases fired from the_rear of the_weapon.
this makes the_smaw-d inherently dangerous, especially in confined,_urban_areas, as is with all_weapons of this_design.
the_m141 has two_configurations: a_carry_mode in which the_launcher is 810_mm (32 in) long, and a ready to fire mode in which the_launcher is extended to the_launcher full_length of 1,400_mm (55 in).
the_launcher is the_same_high_explosive, dual_purpose (hedp)
as the_usmc_smaw.
the_launcher is effective against masonry_and_concrete_bunkers_as_well_as_lightly_armored_vehicles.
the_projectile is capable of penetrating up to 200 mm (8 in) of concrete, 300_mm (12 in) of brick, or 2.1_m (6.9 ft) of sandbags.
the_warhead is activated by a_crush_switch in
the_warhead_nose that is able to distinguish between hard_and_soft_targets.
on soft_targets, such as sandbags, the_detonation is delayed until the_projectile is buried in the_target, producing a_devastating_effect.
the_warhead detonates immediately on contact with hard_targets.

early_photos of israeli_b-300_a_welding_power_supply is a_device that provides or modulates an_electric_current to perform arc_welding.
there are multiple_arc_welding_processes in common_use ranging from relatively_simple_shielded_metal_arc_welding (smaw) to more_complicated_welding_processes using inert_shielding_gas like gas_metal_arc_welding (gmaw) or gas_tungsten_arc_welding (gtaw).
welding_power_supplies primarily serve as devices that allow a_welder to exercise control over whether current is alternating current_(ac) or direct current (dc), as well as the_amperage and voltage.
power_supplies for welding_processes that use shielding_gas also offer connections for gas and methods to control gas_flow.
the_operator can set these_factors to within the_parameters as needed by the_metal_type, thickness, and technique to be used.
the_majority of welding_power_supplies do not generate power, instead functioning as controllable_transformers that allow the_operator to adjust electrical_properties as needed.
however, in some_welding_applications, notably_smaw, used in areas isolated from power_grids, welding_power_supplies are used that combine the_functions of electrical_generation and current_modulation into a_single_mobile_unit mounted on a_vehicle_or_towed_trailer.
classification ==
welding_machines are usually classified as constant_current_(cc) or constant_voltage (cv); a_constant_current_machine varies its_output_voltage to maintain a_steady_current while a constant_voltage machine will fluctuate a constant_voltage machine output current to maintain a_set_voltage.
shielded_metal_arc_welding_and_gas_tungsten_arc_welding will use a constant_current source and gas metal arc welding and flux-cored arc welding typically use constant_voltage_sources but constant_current is also possible with a_voltage_sensing_wire_feeder.
the_nature of the_cv_machine is required by
gas_metal_arc_welding_and_flux-cored_arc_welding because the_welder is not able to control the_arc_length manually.
if a_welder were to attempt to use a_cv_machine for a_shielded_metal_arc_welding (smaw)_task, the_small_fluctuations in the_arc_distance would cause significant_fluctuations in the_cv_machine's_current_output.
with a_cc_machine the_welder can count on a_fixed_number of amps reaching the_material, regardless of how short or long the_electric_arc gets.
power_supply_designs ==
the_welding_power_supplies most commonly seen can be categorized within the_following_types: ===
transformer ===
a_transformer-style_welding_power_supply converts the_moderate_voltage and moderate_current_electricity from the_utility_mains (typically_230_or_115_vac) into a_high_current_and_low_voltage_supply, typically_between_17_and_45_(open-circuit)_volts and 55_to_590_amperes.
a_rectifier converts the_ac into dc on more_expensive_machines.
this_design typically allows the_welder to select the_output current by variously moving a_primary_winding closer or farther from a_secondary_winding, moving a_magnetic_shunt in and out of the_core of the_transformer, using a_series saturating reactor with a_variable_saturating_technique in series with the_secondary_current_output, or by simply permitting the_welder to select the_output voltage from a_set of taps on the_transformer's secondary winding.
these_transformer_style_machines are typically the least expensive.
the_trade off for the_reduced_expense is that pure_transformer_designs are often bulky and massive because these_transformer_style_machines operate at the_utility_mains_frequency of 50_or_60_hz.
such_low_frequency_transformers must have a_high_magnetizing_inductance to avoid wasteful_shunt_currents.
the_transformer may also have significant_leakage_inductance for short_circuit_protection in the_event of a_welding_rod becoming stuck to the_workpiece.
significant_leakage_inductance for short_circuit_protection in the_event of a_welding_rod becoming stuck to the_workpiece may be variable
so the_operator can set the_output_current.
generator and alternator ===
welding_power_supplies may also use generators or alternators to convert mechanical_energy into electrical_energy.
modern_designs are usually driven by an_internal_combustion_engine but older_machines may use an_electric_motor to drive an_alternator or generator.
in this_configuration the_utility_power is converted first into mechanical_energy then back into electrical_energy to achieve the_step-down_effect similar to a_transformer.
because the_output of the_generator can be direct current, or even a higher frequency ac, these_older_machines can produce dc from ac without any_need for rectifiers of any_type, or can also be used for implementing formerly-used_variations on so-called_heliarc (most often now called tig) welders, where the_need for a_higher_frequency_add-on_module_box is avoided by the_alternator simply producing higher frequency ac current directly.
inverter ===
since the_advent of high-power_semiconductors such as the_insulated_gate_bipolar_transistor (igbt), it is now possible to build a_switched-mode_power_supply capable of coping with the_high_loads of arc_welding.
these_designs are known as inverter_welding_units.
these_designs generally first rectify the_utility_ac_power to dc; then these_designs switch (invert) the dc power into a_stepdown_transformer to produce the_desired_welding_voltage or current.
the_switching_frequency is typically 10_khz or higher.
although the_high_switching_frequency requires sophisticated_components and circuits,   drastically reduces the_bulk of the_step down transformer, as the_mass of magnetic_components (transformers and inductors) that is required for achieving a_given_power_level goes down rapidly as the_operating_(switching)_frequency is increased.
the_inverter_circuitry can also provide features such as power_control and overload_protection.
the_inverter_circuitry are typically more efficient and provide better_control of variable_functional_parameters than non-inverter_welding_machines.
the_igbts in an_inverter_based_machine are controlled by a_microcontroller, so the_electrical_characteristics of the_welding_power can be changed by software in real_time, even on a_cycle by cycle_basis, rather than making changes slowly over hundreds if not thousands of cycles.
typically, the_controller_software will implement features such as pulsing the_welding_current, providing variable_ratios and current_densities through a_welding_cycle, enabling swept_or_stepped_variable_frequencies, and providing timing as needed for implementing automatic_spot-welding; all of these_features would be prohibitively expensive to design into a_transformer-based_machine, but require only_program_memory_space in a_software-controlled_inverter_machine.
similarly, it is possible to add new_features to a_software-controlled_inverter_machine if needed, through a_software_update, rather than through having to buy a_more_modern_welder.
other_types ===
additional_types of welders also exist, besides the_types using transformers, motor/generator, and inverters.
for example, laser_welders also exist, and laser_welders require an_entirely_different_type of welding_power_supply_design that does not fall into any of the_types of welding_power_supplies discussed previously.
likewise, spot_welders require a_different_type of welding_power_supply, typically containing elaborate_timing_circuits and large_capacitor_banks that are not commonly found with any_other_types of welding_power_supplies.

weapons used ==
the_basic_infantry_weapon of the_united_states_marine_corps is the_m27_infantry_automatic_rifle.
suppressive_fire is provided by the_m240b_machine_gun, at the_squad_and_company_levels respectively.
marines at the_rank of e4 and above rate the_m17_semi-automatic_pistol.
in addition, indirect_fire is provided by the_m203_grenade_launcher in fireteams, m224a1_60_mm_mortar in companies, and m252 81_mm mortar in battalions.
the_m2_.50_caliber_heavy_machine_gun and mk19_automatic_grenade_launcher (40_mm) are available for use by dismounted_infantry, though the_m2_.50_caliber_heavy_machine_gun and mk19_automatic_grenade_launcher (40_mm) are more commonly vehicle-mounted.
precision_fire is provided by the_m110_semi-automatic_sniper_system and m40a3, a5, a6_bolt-action_sniper_rifle.
the_marine_corps uses a_variety of direct-fire_rockets and missiles to provide infantry with an_offensive_and_defensive_anti-armor_capability.
the_smaw and at4 are unguided_rockets that can destroy armor and fixed_defenses (e.g._bunkers) at ranges up_to_500_meters.
the_fgm-148_javelin and bgm-71_tow are anti-tank_guided_missiles; the_fgm-148_javelin and bgm-71_tow can utilize top-attack_profiles to avoid heavy_frontal_armor and are heavy_missiles effective past 2,000_meters that give infantry an_offensive_capability against armor.
marines are capable of deploying non-lethal_weaponry as the_situation dictates.
part of a_marine_expeditionary_unit earning the_special_operations_capable_designator requires a_company-sized_unit capable of riot_control.
some_older_weapons are used for ceremonial_purposes, such as the_silent_drill_platoon's_m1_garands, or the_use of the_m101_howitzer for gun_salutes.

commons_a_spotting_rifle or ranging_gun is a_small-calibre_rifle used as a_sighting_device for artillery.
the_ballistics of the_spotting_rifle are matched to those of the_artillery_piece, so that if a_shot from the_spotting_rifle lands on the_target, it may be assumed that the_main_weapon will also do so.
anti-tank_recoilless_rifles ==
spotting rifles were most commonly used with recoilless_rifles as anti-tank_artillery, from the_1950s to the_1970s.
these_weapons are used for direct_fire with line-of-sight visibility to the_target.
as recoilless_rifles have a_relatively_low_muzzle_velocity and thus_a_high_trajectory, accurate ranging is important
an_optical_sight can measure the_bearing to a_target, but not easily or accurately measure the_range.
optical_rangefinders were too large for lightweight_portable_artillery, and the_later_development of laser_rangefinders would in turn make spotting rifles obsolete.
the_british_bat_series of 120_mm_anti-tank_recoilless_rifles used a_variety of sighting_systems.
the_british_bat_series of 120_mm_anti-tank_recoilless_rifles used a_purely_optical_sight.
the_mobat, a_lightweight_and_more_portable_version, had a_7.62×51mm_nato_bren_light_machine_gun.
the_final_version, the_wombat, used the_same_american_remington_m8c .50
in as the_m40_recoilless_rifle.
both of these were used as gas-operated_semi-automatic_rifles.
the .50 was not, as often assumed, a_development of the_.50_m2_machine_gun using the_12.7×99mm_nato_cartridge, but was a_shortened_12.7×76mm_cartridge.
where a_vehicle, such as the_m50_ontos, used multiple_barrels, spotting rifles were usually provided for each_barrel so that each could be accurately boresighted to the_m50_ontos own_barrel.
the_m50_ontos used six_barrels with four_spotting_rifles; two without, to avoid making an_already_tall_vehicle even higher.
this_provision may have been over-generous, although  this_provision did also increase the_magazine_capacity available for repeated_ranging_shots.
many_photographs of the_ontos in service in vietnam show the_ontos with only two of the_spotting_rifles installed in many_photographs of the_ontos in service in vietnam mounts.
the_ontos also often carried only_four_or_even_two_main_gun_tubes.

rocket_launchers ==
perhaps the_smallest_weapons to use spotting rifles are man-portable_shoulder-launched_rocket_launchers.
the_british_94mm_law 80 is a_rocket_launcher developed as a_replacement for the_law 66 and carl_gustav to give a_more_powerful_infantry_anti-tank_capability.
this uses a_9_mm_rifle with a_5-round_magazine and a_particularly_unusual_design of ballistically_matched_cartridge.
this_same_spotting_rifle (mk_8_mod 0) and round was later adopted for the us 83_mm shoulder-launched multipurpose assault weapon (smaw).
tank main_guns ==
a_rare_few_tanks have used spotting rifles, termed a "ranging gun" for ranging a_rare_few_tanks main gun.
this was a_short-lived_use, from the_period in the_1950s when the_increasingly_powerful_tank_guns (and their_reduced_capacity for spare_ammunition) encouraged a more carefully ranged first shot in the_hope of an_immediate_kill, and the_later_development of laser_rangefinders.
the british centurion mk 5/2 with its_new_105mm_l7_main_gun introduced a_ranging_gun.
this was derived from the_m2_browning_design, both_the_l6_variant of the_gun and also the_gun 12.7×99mm ammunition.
this_ammunition was once again ballistically matched to the_main_gun.
as this was a_rather_higher_velocity_round than the_recoilless_rifles, the_case was the same as the_m2 and the_rounds could be used in either_weapon.
the_enhanced_tracer_effect of the_spotting_round was sometimes used in an_m2.
mounted in the_centurion it was alongside another_conventional_co-axial_machine_gun, the_ranging_gun being the one in the_mantlet closest to the_main_gun.
the_ranging_gun was considered a success on the_centurion the_centurion and was fitted to several_marks of the_ranging_gun, including retrofitting to earlier_models with the_main_gun.
the_same_ranging_gun_principle was later used for the_120mm_gun of the_chieftain.
the_same_ranging_gun_principle was considered less successful with the_120mm_gun of the_chieftain, as the_range for accurate_ranging was limited to 2,600_yards — beyond this the_tracer_element burned out and the_fall of shot could no longer be seen.
as the_120mm_gun of the_chieftain's_own_range with hesh could be up_to_8,700_yards, this represented a_serious_limitation on performance.
battle planning at this_time also saw a_need for combat at increasing_ranges, from the_2,000_yards expected for the_centurion's_vintage out_to_3,000_yards and beyond.
as soon as they became available, the_chieftain rapidly adopted a_laser_rangefinder instead.
a_later_uk_light_tank using a_ranging_gun is the_fv101_scorpion, which uses a_7.62mm_l43a1_machine_gun.
this is mounted as a_normal_co-axial_machine_gun and may be used as such.
this is a_development of the_standard_british_l8_tk_mg, used on a_number of afvs and artillery_pieces.
this has an_additional_barrel_bearing that is used to mount the_gun.
this_bearing, rather than mounting by the_receiver as for the_l8, gives a_more_consistent_point of impact between a_cold_and_hot_barrel, which is important for use when ranging.

the_at4 (also_at-4) is an_84-mm_unguided,_portable,_single-shot_recoilless_smoothbore_anti-tank_weapon built in sweden by saab_bofors_dynamics (previously_bofors_anti-armour_systems).
saab_bofors_dynamics (previously_bofors_anti-armour_systems) has had considerable_sales_success with
the_at4 (also_at-4), making saab_bofors_dynamics (previously_bofors_anti-armour_systems) one of the_most_common_light_anti-tank_weapons in the_world.
the_at4 (also_at-4) is intended to give infantry_units a means to destroy or disable armoured_vehicles and fortifications, although  the_at4 (also_at-4) is generally ineffective against current_modern_main_battle_tanks (mbt).
the_launcher and projectile are manufactured prepacked and issued as a_single_unit of ammunition, with the_launcher discarded after a_single_use.
development ==
the_at4 is a_development of the_74-mm_pansarskott m/68 (miniman), adopted by the_swedish_army in the_late_1960s.
like the_m/68, the_at4 was designed by förenade_fabriksverken (ffv) and manufactured at their_facility at zakrisdal, karlstad, sweden.
förenade_fabriksverken (ffv) began research in a_replacement for the_m/68 in 1976, deliberately designing an_individual_anti-armor_weapon that would not be able to defeat the_heavy_armour_protection of mbts (main_battle_tanks) in frontal_engagements, believing that to be counterproductive.
the_at4 was designed as a_weapon to engage medium_to_light_armoured_vehicles from any_direction, mbts from the_sides or rear, and as an_assault_weapon against buildings and fortifications.
ffv also had the_design_goal of a_weapon that was simple to use, rugged, and far more accurate than previous_individual_antiarmor_weapons against moving targets.
another_key_requirement was that the_at4 not only be able to penetrate armour, but also have a devastating beyond-armour effect after penetration.
ffv and the_swedish_army began the_first_evaluation_firings of the_prototype_at4s in the_spring of 1981 with 100 tested by early 1982.even before the_at4 had been adopted by sweden, the_at4 was entered into a_us_army_competition for a_new_anti-tank_weapon mandated by congress in 1982 when the_fgr-17_viper failed as a_replacement for the_m72_law.
six_weapons were tested in 1983 by the_us_army: the_british_law 80, the_german_armbrust, the_french_apilas, the_norwegian_m72e4 (an_upgraded_m72_law), the_us_viper (for baseline_comparison_purposes) and the_swedish_at4.
the_us_army reported to congress in november 1983 that the_ffv_at4 came the closest to meeting all_the_major_requirements established to replace the_m72_law, with the_armbrust coming in second.
though very impressed with the_simplicity and durability of the_tested_version of the_at4, the_us_army saw some_room for improvement, specifically_the_addition of rear_and_front_bumpers on the_launch_tube and changes to the_sights and slings.
after these_changes, the_at4 was adopted by the_us_army as the_lightweight_multipurpose_weapon_m136.
the_us_army also recognized these_improvements and subsequently adopted the_americanized_version of the_at4 as the_pansarskott
m/86_(pskott m/86), with the_addition of a_forward_folding_hand_grip to help steady the_at4 when being aimed and fired.
the_forward_folding_grip is the_only_difference between the_at4 adopted by sweden and the_the_us_army_version.
due to the_urban_combat_conditions that us_military_forces faced regularly during the_iraq_war, the_us_army_close_combat_systems_manager in charge of purchases of the_at4 suspended orders for the_standard_version of the_at4 and us_military_forces are now only ordering the_at4 cs (confined_space)_version.
operation ==
the_at4 may be considered a disposable, low-cost alternative to a_carl_gustaf_8.4cm_recoilless_rifle.
the_at4 took many of the_at4 design features from the_carl_gustaf, which operates on the_principle of a_recoilless_weapon, where the_forward_inertia of the_projectile is balanced by the_inertia of propellant_gases ejecting from the_rear of the_barrel.
but unlike the_carl_gustaf, which uses a_heavier_and_more_expensive_steel_tube with rifling, the_disposable_at4_design greatly reduces manufacturing_costs by using a_reinforced_smoothbore_fiberglass_outer_tube.
being a_disposable_gun also allows for lighter_and_cheaper_construction.
in a_single-use_disposable_gun, the_barrel only needs to be able to contain a_single_pressure_spike when firing, when the_barrel can be disposed of, even if the_barrel is ruined, burnt-out and strained, unlike traditional_guns which are required to survive many_pressure_spikes without failure and thus need to be strongly overbuilt and made of heat-proof_materials.
pressures are also kept quite low compared to many_traditional_guns.
this_lightweight_and_thin_barrel and low_pressure, combined with the_almost_complete_lack of recoil, means that relatively_large_projectiles (comparable to those found in mortars and artillery_systems) can be utilised, which would otherwise be impossible in a_man-portable_weapon.
in the_system originally developed by ffv for the_carl_gustaf, a_plastic_blowout_plug is placed at the_center_rear of the_shell_casing containing the_projectile and propellant, which itself is enclosed in the_at4_outer_tube.
when the_gases build up to the_correct_pressure_level, a_plastic_blowout_plug disintegrates, allowing the_proper_amount of gases to be vented to the_rear, balancing the_propellant_gases pushing the_projectile forward.
the_at4 uses a_unique_method developed earlier by ffv and adopted for the_at4: the_spring-loaded_firing_rod is located down the_side of the_outer_tube, with the_firing_pin at the_rear of the_at4_outer_tube.
when released, the_firing_pin at the_rear of the tube strikes a_primer located in the_side of the_casing's_rim.
the_disadvantage of the_recoilless_design is that the_recoilless_design creates a_large_back_blast_area behind the_weapon, which can cause severe_burns and overpressure_injuries to friendly_personnel in the_vicinity of the_user and sometimes even to the_users themselves, especially in confined_spaces.
the_back_blast may also reveal the_user's_position to the_enemy.
the_problem of back_blast was solved with the_at4-cs_(confined_space)_version, specially designed for urban_warfare.
the at4-cs (confined_space) version, specially designed for urban_warfare uses a_saltwater_countermass in the_rear of the_launcher to absorb back_blast; the resulting spray captures and dramatically slows down the_pressure_wave, allowing troops to fire from enclosed_areas.
the at4-cs (confined_space) version, specially designed for urban_warfare also reduced the at4-cs (confined_space) version, specially designed for urban_warfare muzzle velocity from the_original_290_m/s to 220_m/s as part of the at4-cs (confined_space) version, specially designed for urban_warfare effort to be user-safe in a_confined_space, making the at4-cs (confined_space) version, specially designed for urban_warfare more difficult to use as the_drop is more pronounced.
the_effectiveness of the_heat_warhead is not dependent on speed.
to fire, the_gunner first removes the_safety_pin located at the_rear of the_tube, which unblocks the_firing_rod.
the_gunner then takes a_firing_position ensuring that no_one is present in the_back_blast_area.
if firing from the_prone_position, the_gunner must also place the_gunner legs well to the_side to avoid burning the_gunner.
then the_gunner moves back the_front_and_rear_sight_covers, allowing the_sights to pop up into their_firing_positions.
the_at4 has iron_sights that were originally developed for the_cancelled_viper, and are similar in concept and use to those on assault_rifles.
he then removes the first of two_safeties by moving the_firing_rod_cocking_lever (located on the_left_side) forward and then over the_top to the_right_side.
the_gunner takes aim, while at the_same_time holding down the_red_safety_lever located in front of the_cocking_lever, and then_fires by pressing forward the_red_firing_button with the_gunner right thumb.
both_the_red_safety_lever and the_firing_button must be pressed down at the_same_time to fire the_at4.
the_red_firing_button has a_similar_resistance to the_trigger_pull of a_rifle, so the_gunner does not have to jab at the_firing_button, which could throw the_gunner aim off.
after firing, the_at4 is discarded.
unlike the_heavier_carl_gustaf, the_at4_outer_tube is built to take the_stress of just_one_firing; the_at4_outer_tube is not reusable and cannot be reloaded.
at4 can mount an_optical_night_sight on a_removable_fixture.
in us_military_use, the_launcher can be fitted with the_an/paq-4c, an/peq-2, or the_an/pas-13_night_sights.
at4 requires little_training and is quite simple to use, making at4 suitable for general_issue.
however, as the_cost of each_launcher makes regular_live-fire_training very expensive, practice_versions exist that are identical in operation but fire reloadable 9×19mm_or_20mm_tracer_ammunition.
both_practice_cartridges are unique to
both_practice cartridges respective_weapons, with  both_practice cartridges trajectory matched to that of the_live_round.
the_20mm_version also has a_recoilless_weapon_effect with the_same_high_noise and back_blast as the_at4 firing and is favoured by the_swedish_army because of the_added_realism of the back_blast as compared to the_"plonk"_sound of the_9mm_round (similar to the_sound of a_finger tapping on an_empty_can).

projectiles ==
there are several_different_projectiles for the_at4.
note that because the_at4 is a_one-shot_weapon, projectiles are preloaded into the_launcher_tubes.
heat (high_explosive_anti-tank)
the_heat_projectile can penetrate up_to_420_mm (16.5_inches) of rha with beyond-armour effect.
(high_explosive_dual_purpose)
for use against bunkers, buildings, enemy_personnel in the_open_and_light_armour.
the_heat_projectile can be set to detonate on impact or with a_slightly_delayed_detonation.
the_heavier_nose_cap allows for the_hedp_projectile to either penetrate light_walls or windows and then explode, or be "skipped" off the_ground for an_airburst.
for use against light_armour, there is a_smaller_cone_heat_warhead with 150_mm (5.9_inches) of penetration against rha.hp (high_penetration)
extra_high_penetration_ability (up_to_500_mm to 600 mm (19.7_inches to 23.6_inches) of rha.)ast
(anti_structure_tandem-warheads) designed for urban_warfare where a_projectile heavier than the_hedp_at4 is needed.
this_projectile combines a_heat_warhead with a_shallow_cone, which results in low_penetration but produces a_wide_hole, with a_follow-through_high-blast_warhead.
this_projectile has two_settings: one for destroying bunkers and one for mouse-holing a_building_wall for combat_entry.
(extended_range)_anti-armor_version with heat_warhead that extends range from 300_m to 600_m.
he (high_explosive)_high_explosive_anti-personnel_weapon that can be set for impact or airburst detonation, with an_effective_range of up_to_1,000_m. ==
variants ==
american_version with modified_launch_tube_bumpers, sights and slings.
at8_(bunker-busting)
a_version of the_at4 where the_standard_heat_projectile is replaced with the_bunker-busting_warhead developed for the_smaw.
no_orders were ever placed.
in the_early_1990s, there were tests of a_tandem_charge_120-mm_version ( bofors at 12-t) that would be able to penetrate the_front_armour of any_modern_main_battle_tank.
however, the_project was cancelled due to the_dissolution of the_soviet_union and the_subsequent_cuts in western_defence_budgets.

the_at4 has been in the_venezuelan_arsenal since the 1980s.
in 2009, the_at4 was reported that at4s sold to  venezuela had been captured from farc_insurgents in colombia, leading colombia to accuse  venezuela of selling the_weapons to the_insurgents, and  venezuela reporting that at4s sold to venezuela were stolen by a_rebel_attack on a venezuelan position in 1995, thus heightening tensions between the_two_countries.
