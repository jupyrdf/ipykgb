Star Wars is an American epic space opera media franchise created by George Lucas, which began with the eponymous 1977 film and quickly became a worldwide pop-culture phenomenon.
The franchise has been expanded into various films and other media, including television series, video games, novels, comic books, theme park attractions, and themed areas, comprising an all-encompassing fictional universe.
In 2020, its total value was estimated at US$70 billion, and it is currently the fifth-highest-grossing media franchise of all time.

The original film (Star Wars), retroactively subtitled Episode IV: A New Hope (1977), was followed by the sequels Episode V:
The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Episode VI:
Return of the Jedi (1983), forming the original Star Wars trilogy.
Lucas later returned to filmmaking to direct a prequel trilogy, consisting of Episode I: The Phantom Menace (1999), Episode II: Attack of the Clones (2002), and Episode III: Revenge of the Sith (2005).
In 2012, Lucas sold his production company to Disney, relinquishing his ownership of the franchise.
The subsequently produced sequel trilogy consists of Episode VII:
The Force Awakens (2015),
Episode VIII:
The Last Jedi (2017), and Episode IX:
The Rise of Skywalker (2019).

All nine films of the 'Skywalker saga' were nominated for Academy Awards with wins going to the first two releases.
Together with the theatrical live action spin-off films Rogue One (2016) and Solo (2018), the combined box office revenue of the films equated to over US$10 billion and is currently the second-highest-grossing film franchise of all time.

==
Premise ==
The Star Wars franchise depicts the adventures of characters "A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away", in which humans and many species of aliens (often humanoid) co-exist with robots, or 'droids', who may assist them in their daily routines; space travel between planets is common due to lightspeed hyperspace technology.
Spacecraft range from small starfighters, to huge capital ships such as the Star Destroyers, to space stations such as the moon-sized Death Stars.
Telecommunication includes two-way audio and audiovisual screens, and holographic projections.

A mystical power known as the Force is described in the original film as "an energy field created by all living things ...
[that] binds the galaxy together".
Through training and meditation, those whom "the Force is strong with" are able to perform various superpowers (such as telekinesis, precognition, telepathy, and manipulation of physical energy).
The Force is wielded by two major knightly orders at conflict with each other: the Jedi, peacekeepers of the Galactic Republic who act on the light side of the Force through non-attachment and arbitration, and the Sith, who use the dark side by manipulating fear and aggression.
While Jedi Knights can be numerous, the Dark Lords of the Sith (or 'Darths') are intended to be limited to two: a master and their apprentice.
Force-wielders are very limited in numbers in comparison to the average population.
The Jedi and Sith prefer the use of a weapon called a lightsaber, a blade of energy that can cut through virtually any surface and deflect energy bolts.
The rest of the population, as well as renegades and soldiers, use laser-powered blaster firearms.
In the outer reaches of the galaxy, crime syndicates such as the Hutt cartel are dominant.
Bounty hunters are often employed by both gangsters and governments.
Illicit activities include smuggling and slavery.

==
Film ==
The Star Wars film series centers around three sets of trilogies, which are collectively referred to as the "Skywalker saga".
They were produced non-chronologically, with Episodes IV–VI (the original trilogy) being released between 1977 and 1983, Episodes I–III (the prequel trilogy) being released between 1999 and 2005, and Episodes VII–IX (the sequel trilogy), being released between 2015 and 2019.
Each trilogy focuses on a generation of the Force-sensitive Skywalker family.
The original trilogy depicts the heroic development of Luke Skywalker, the prequels tell the backstory of his father Anakin, while the sequels star Luke's nephew, Kylo Ren.

An anthology series set between the main episodes entered development in parallel to the production of the sequel trilogy, described by Disney chief financial officer Jay Rasulo as origin stories.
The first entry, Rogue One (2016), tells the story of the rebels who steal the Death Star plans just before Episode IV.
Solo (2018) focuses on Han Solo's backstory, also featuring original trilogy co-protagonists Chewbacca and Lando Calrissian and involving prequel trilogy villain Darth Maul.

Lucasfilm has a number of Star Wars films in development, two of which were confirmed during Disney Investor Day 2020.
The first will be a film titled Rogue Squadron, which is being directed by Patty Jenkins, and is scheduled for release on December 25, 2023.
The second is an unspecified film from Taika Waititi, who in May 2020 was announced to be directing a Star Wars film
he was co-writing with Krysty Wilson-Cairns.
Additionally, a trilogy independent from the Skywalker saga is being written by The Last Jedi writer/director Rian Johnson.
In September 2019, it was announced that Kathleen Kennedy and Kevin Feige would collaborate to develop a Star Wars film.
In February 2020, a film was announced to be in development from director J. D. Dillard and writer Matt Owens.

The Skywalker saga ===


====
Original trilogy ====
In 1971, George Lucas wanted to film an adaptation of the Flash Gordon serial, but could not obtain the rights, so he began developing his own space opera.
After directing American Graffiti (1973), he wrote a two-page synopsis, which 20th Century Fox decided to invest in.
By 1974, he had expanded the story into the first draft of a screenplay.
The 1977 movie's success led Lucas to make it the basis of an elaborate film serial.
With the backstory he created for the sequel, Lucas decided that the series would be a trilogy of trilogies.
Most of the main cast would return for the two additional installments of the original trilogy, which were self-financed by Lucasfilm.

Star Wars was released on May 25, 1977, and first subtitled Episode IV:
A New Hope in the 1979 book The Art of Star Wars.
Episode V:
The Empire Strikes Back was released on May 21, 1980, also achieving wide financial and critical success.
The final film in the trilogy, Episode VI:
Return of the Jedi was released on May 25, 1983.
The story of the original trilogy focuses on Luke Skywalker's quest to become a Jedi, his struggle with the evil Imperial agent Darth Vader, and the struggle of the Rebel Alliance to free the galaxy from the clutches of the Galactic Empire.

====
Prequel
trilogy ====
According to producer Gary Kurtz, loose plans for a prequel trilogy were developed during the outlining of the original two films.
In 1980, Lucas confirmed that he had the nine-film series plotted, but due to the stress of producing the original trilogy, he had decided to cancel further sequels by 1981.
In 1983, Lucas explained that "There was never a script completed that had the entire story as it exists now ...
As the stories unfolded, I would take certain ideas and save them ...
I kept taking out all the good parts, and I just kept telling myself I would make other movies someday.
"Technical
advances in the late 1980s and early 1990s, including the ability to create computer-generated imagery (CGI), inspired Lucas to consider that it might be possible to revisit his saga.
In 1989, Lucas stated that the prequels would be "unbelievably expensive."
In 1992, he acknowledged that he had plans to create the prequel trilogy.
A theatrical rerelease of the original trilogy in 1997 "updated" the 20-year-old films with the style of CGI envisioned for the new trilogy.

Episode
I:
The Phantom Menace was released on May 19, 1999, and Episode II:
Attack of the Clones on May 16, 2002.
Episode III: Revenge of the Sith, the first PG-13 film in the franchise, was released on May 19, 2005.
The first two movies were met with mixed reviews, with the third being received somewhat more positively.
The trilogy begins 32 years before Episode IV and follows the Jedi training of Anakin Skywalker, Luke's father, and his eventual fall from grace and transformation into the Sith lord Darth Vader, as well as the corruption of the Galactic Republic and rise of the Empire led by Darth Sidious.
Together with the original trilogy, Lucas has collectively referred to the first six episodic films of the franchise as "the tragedy of Darth Vader".
====
Sequel
trilogy ====
Prior to releasing the original film, and made possible by its success, Lucas planned "three trilogies of nine films."
He announced this to Time in 1978, and confirmed that he had outlined them in 1981.
At various stages of development, the sequel trilogy was to focus on the rebuilding of the Republic, the return of Luke in a role similar to that of Obi-Wan in the original trilogy, Luke's sister (not yet determined to be Leia), Han, Leia, R2-D2 and C-3PO.
However, after beginning work on the prequel trilogy, Lucas insisted that Star Wars was meant to be a six-part series and that there would be no sequel trilogy.
Lucas decided to leave the franchise in the hands of other filmmakers, announcing in January 2012 that he would make no more Star Wars films.
In October of that year, the Walt Disney Company agreed to buy Lucasfilm and announced that Episode VII would be released in 2015.
The co-chairman of Lucasfilm, Kathleen Kennedy, became president of the company and served as executive producer of new Star Wars feature films.
Lucas provided Kennedy his story treatments for the sequels during the 2012 sale, but in 2015 it was revealed Lucas's sequel outline had been discarded.
The sequel trilogy also meant the end of the existing Star Wars Expanded Universe, which was discarded from canon to give "maximum creative freedom to the filmmakers and also preserve an element of surprise and discovery for the audience.
"Episode
VII:
The Force Awakens was released on December 16, 2015, Episode VIII:
The Last Jedi on December 13, 2017, and Episode IX:
The Rise of Skywalker on December 18, 2019, in many countries.
The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi were both a critical and box office successes.
Episode IX received a mixed reception from critics and audiences.
The sequel trilogy starts 30 years after Episode VI and focuses on the journey of the Force-sensitive orphan Rey, guided by Luke Skywalker.
Along with ex-stormtrooper Finn and ace X-Wing pilot Poe Dameron, Rey helps the Resistance, led by Leia, fight the First Order, commanded by Han and Leia's son (and Luke's nephew), Kylo Ren.
===
Anthology films ===
Lucasfilm and Kennedy have stated that the standalone films would be referred to as the Star Wars anthology series (though the word anthology has not been used in any of the titles, instead carrying the promotional "A Star Wars Story" subtitle).
Focused on how the Rebels obtained the Death Star plans introduced in the 1977 film, the first anthology film, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, was released on December 16, 2016, to favorable reviews and box office success.
The second, Solo:
A Star Wars Story, centered on a young Han Solo with Chewbacca and Lando as supporting characters, was released on May 25, 2018, to generally favorable reviews and underperformance at the box office.
Despite this, more anthology films are expected to be released, following a hiatus after 2019's The Rise of Skywalker.

==
Television ==
The Star Wars franchise has been spun off to various television productions, including two animated series released in the mid-1980s.
Further animated series began to be released in the 2000s, the first two of which focused on the Clone Wars.
After Disney's acquisition of Lucasfilm, only the later one remained canon.
Eight live-action Star Wars series will be released on Disney+.
The first, The Mandalorian, premiered on November 12, 2019.
Star Wars won the 2020 Webby Award for Television & Film in the category Social.
Disney+
later released the Ewoks movies and animated series, along the animated first appearance of Boba Fett, and the Clone Wars animated micro-series in a section called Star Wars Vintage, that section will also include the Droids animated series in the future.
Certain aspects of the original Clone Wars micro-series are considered to not contradict the canon, while others do.

Fictional timeline ==
The Star Wars canon fictional universe spans multiple eras, of which three are focused around each of the film trilogies.
The following eras were defined in January 2021:

The era of the "High Republic", set 200 years before the prequel trilogy.
It includes the media released in The High Republic and the upcoming The Acolyte.

Fall of the Jedi: The era of the prequel trilogy, in which the democratic Galactic Republic is corrupted by its ruler, Palpatine—secretly the Sith lord Darth Sidious.
After orchestrating the Clone Wars between the Republic and a Separatist confederation, Palpatine exterminates the Jedi Order, overthrows the Republic, and establishes the totalitarian Galactic Empire.
It includes the prequel trilogy films and the animated The Clone Wars.
This era was previously defined as The Age of Republic in August 2019.

Reign of the Empire:
The era after the prequel trilogy, exploring the reign of the Empire.
It includes the animated The Bad Batch and Solo: A Star Wars Story.

The Age of Rebellion:
The era of the original trilogy, in which the Empire is fought by the Rebel Alliance in a Galactic Civil War that spans several years, climaxing with the death of the Emperor and eventually resulting in the fall of the Empire.
It includes the animated Star Wars Rebels, Rogue One, and the original trilogy films.

The New Republic:
The era after the original trilogy, set during the formative years of the New Republic following the fall of the Empire.
It includes The Mandalorian and its spin-off series, The Book of Boba Fett, Rangers of the New Republic, and Ahsoka.

Heroes of the former Rebellion, aided by the New Republic, lead the Resistance against the oppressive regime and its rulers, the mysterious being known as Snoke and his puppet master, the revived Palpatine.
It includes the animated Star Wars Resistance and the sequel trilogy films.
This era was previously defined as The Age of Resistance in August 2019.The
Expanded Universe of spin-off media depicts different levels of continuity, which were deemed non-canonical and rebranded as Legends on April 25, 2014, to make most subsequent works align to the episodic films, The Clone Wars film, and television series.

==
In other media ==
From 1976 to 2014, the term Expanded Universe (EU) was an umbrella term for all officially licensed Star Wars storytelling material set outside the events depicted within the theatrical films, including novels, comics, and video games.
Lucasfilm maintained internal continuity between the films and television content and the EU material until April 25, 2014, when the company announced all of the EU works would cease production.
Existing works would no longer be considered canon to the franchise and subsequent reprints would be rebranded under the Star Wars Legends label, with downloadable content for the massively multiplayer online game
The Old Republic the only Legends material to still be produced.
The Star Wars canon was subsequently restructured to only include the existing six feature films, the animated film The Clone Wars (2008), and its companion animated series.
All future projects and creative developments across all types of media would be overseen and coordinated by the story group, announced as a division of Lucasfilm created to maintain continuity and a cohesive vision on the storytelling of the franchise.
Multiple comics series from Marvel and novels published by Del Rey were produced after the announcement.

===
Print media ===
Star Wars in print predates the release of the first film, with the December 1976 novelization of Star Wars, initially subtitled "From the Adventures of Luke Skywalker".
Credited to Lucas, it was ghostwritten by Alan Dean Foster.
The first "Expanded Universe" story appeared in Marvel Comics' Star Wars #7 in January 1978 (the first six issues being an adaptation of the film), followed by Foster's sequel novel Splinter of the Mind's Eye the following month.

====
Novels ====
After penning the novelization of the original film, Foster followed it with the sequel Splinter of the Mind's Eye (1978).
The novelizations of The Empire Strikes Back (1980) by Donald F. Glut and Return of the Jedi (1983) by James Kahn followed, as well as The Han Solo Adventures trilogy (1979–1980) by Brian Daley, and The Adventures of Lando Calrissian trilogy (1983) by L. Neil Smith.
Timothy Zahn's bestselling Thrawn trilogy (1991–1993) reignited interest in the franchise and introduced the popular characters Grand Admiral Thrawn, Mara Jade, Talon Karrde, and Gilad Pellaeon.
The first novel, Heir to the Empire, reached #1 on the New York Times Best Seller list, and the series finds Luke, Leia, and Han facing off against tactical genius Thrawn, who is plotting to retake the galaxy for the Empire.
In The Courtship of Princess Leia (1994) by Dave Wolverton, set immediately before the Thrawn trilogy, Leia considers an advantageous political marriage to Prince Isolder of the planet Hapes,  but she and Han ultimately marry.
Steve Perry's Shadows of the Empire (1996), set between The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, was part of a multimedia campaign that included a comic book series and video game.
The novel introduced the crime lord Prince Xizor, another popular character who would appear in multiple other works.
Other notable series from Bantam include the Jedi Academy trilogy (1994) by Kevin J. Anderson, the 14-book Young Jedi Knights series (1995–1998) by Anderson and Rebecca Moesta, and the X-wing series (1996–2012) by Michael A. Stackpole and Aaron Allston.
Del Rey took over Star Wars book publishing in 1999, releasing what would become a 19-installment novel series called The New Jedi Order (1999–2003).
Written by multiple authors, the series was set 25 to 30 years after the original films and introduced the Yuuzhan Vong, a powerful alien race attempting to invade and conquer the entire galaxy.
The bestselling multi-author series Legacy of the Force (2006–2008) chronicles the crossover of Han and Leia's son Jacen Solo to the dark side of the Force; among his evil deeds, he kills Luke's wife Mara Jade as a sacrifice to join the Sith.
Although no longer canon, the story is paralleled in The Force Awakens with Han and Leia's son Ben Solo, who has become the dark Kylo Ren.
Three series set in the prequel era were introduced for younger audiences: the 18-book Jedi Apprentice (1999–2002) chronicles the adventures of Obi-Wan Kenobi and his master Qui-Gon Jinn in the years before The Phantom Menace; the 11-book Jedi Quest (2001–2004) follows Obi-Wan and his own apprentice, Anakin Skywalker in between The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones; and the 10-book
The Last of the Jedi (2005–2008), set almost immediately after Revenge of the Sith, features Obi-Wan and the last few surviving Jedi.

Although Thrawn had been designated a Legends character in 2014, he was reintroduced into the canon in the 2016 third season of Rebels, with Zahn returning to write more novels based in the character, and set in the new canon.

====
Comics ====
Marvel Comics published a Star Wars comic book series from 1977 to 1986.
Original Star Wars comics were serialized in the Marvel magazine Pizzazz between 1977 and 1979.
The 1977 installments were the first original Star Wars stories not directly adapted from the films to appear in print form, as they preceded those of the Star Wars comic series.
From 1985 to 1987, the animated children's series Ewoks and Droids inspired comic series from Marvel's Star Comics line.
According to Marvel comics former Editor-In-Chief Jim Shooter, the strong sales of Star Wars comics saved Marvel financially in 1977 and 1978.
Marvel's Star Wars series was one of the industry's top selling titles in 1979 and 1980.
The only downside for Marvel was that the 100,000 copy sales quota was surpassed quickly, allowing Lippincott to renegotiate the royalty arrangements from a position of strength.
In the late 1980s, Marvel dropped a new Star Wars comic it had in development, which was picked up by Dark Horse Comics and published as the popular Dark Empire series (1991–1995).
Dark Horse subsequently launched dozens of series set after the original film trilogy, including Tales of the Jedi (1993–1998), X-wing Rogue Squadron (1995–1998), Star Wars: Republic (1998–2006),
Star Wars Tales (1999–2005),
Star Wars: Empire (2002–2006), and Knights of the Old Republic (2006–2010).After Disney's acquisition of Lucasfilm, it was announced in January 2014 that in 2015 the Star Wars comics license would return to Marvel Comics, whose parent company, Marvel Entertainment, Disney had purchased in 2009.
Launched in 2015, the first three publications were titled Star Wars, Darth Vader, and the limited series Princess Leia.
First announced as Project Luminous at Star Wars Celebration in April 2019, full details of a publishing initiative called Star Wars: The High Republic were revealed in a press conference in February 2020.
Involving the majority of the current officially licensed publishers, a new era set 200 years before the Skywalker Saga will be explored in various books and comics.
These include ongoing titles by Marvel and IDW Publishing, written by Cavan Scott and Daniel José Older respectively, that will both premiere in August 2020.

===
Audio ===
====
Soundtracks and singles ====
John Williams composed the soundtracks for the nine episodic films; he has stated that he will retire from the franchise with The Rise of Skywalker.
He also composed Han Solo's theme for Solo: A Star Wars Story; John Powell adapted and composed the rest of the score.
Michael Giacchino composed the score of Rogue One.
Ludwig Göransson scored and composed the music of The Mandalorian.
Williams also created the main theme for Galaxy's Edge.
====
Audio novels ====
The first Star Wars audio work is The Story of Star Wars, an LP using audio samples from the original film and a new narration to retell the story, released in 1977.
Most later printed novels were adapted into audio novels, usually released on cassette tape and re-released on CD.
As of 2019, audio-only novels have been released not directly based on printed media.

====
Radio ====
Radio adaptations of the films were also produced.
Lucas, a fan of the NPR-affiliated campus radio station of his alma mater the University of Southern California, licensed the Star Wars radio rights to KUSC-FM for US$1.
The production used John Williams's original film score, along with Ben Burtt's sound effects.
The first was written by science-fiction author Brian Daley and directed by John Madden.
It was broadcast on National Public Radio in 1981, adapting the original 1977 film into 13 episodes.
Mark Hamill and Anthony Daniels reprised their film roles.
The overwhelming success, led to a 10-episode adaptation of The Empire Strikes Back debuted in 1983.
Billy Dee Williams joined the other two stars, reprising his role as Lando Calrissian.
In 1983, Buena Vista Records released an original, 30-minute Star Wars audio drama titled Rebel Mission to Ord Mantell, written by Daley.
In the 1990s, Time Warner Audio Publishing adapted several Star Wars series from Dark Horse Comics into audio dramas: the three-part Dark Empire saga, Tales of the Jedi, Dark Lords of the Sith, the Dark Forces trilogy, and Crimson Empire (1998).
Return of the Jedi was adapted into 6-episodes in 1996, featuring Daniels.

===
Video games ===
The Star Wars franchise has spawned over one hundred computer, video, and board games, dating back to some of the earliest home consoles.
Some are based directly on the movie material, while others rely heavily on the non-canonical Expanded Universe (rebranded as Star Wars Legends and removed from the canon in 2014).
Star Wars games have gone through three significant development eras, marked by a change in leadership among the developers: the early licensed games, those developed after the creation of LucasArts, and those created after the closure of the Lucasfilm division by Disney and the transfer of the license to Electronic Arts.

====
Early licensed games (1979–1993) ====
The first officially licensed electronic Star Wars game was Kenner's 1979 table-top Star Wars Electronic Battle Command.
In 1982, Parker Brothers published the first Star Wars video game for the Atari 2600, Star Wars:
The Empire Strikes Back, followed soon the year later by Star Wars: Jedi Arena, the first video game to depict lightsaber combat.
They were followed in 1983 by Atari's rail shooter arcade game Star Wars, with vector graphics to replicate the Death Star trench run scene from the 1977 film.
The next game, Star Wars:
Return of the Jedi (1984), has more traditional raster graphics, while the following Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back (1985) has vector graphics.
Platform games were made for the Nintendo Entertainment System, including the Japan-exclusive Star Wars (1987), an international Star Wars (1991), and Star Wars:
The Empire Strikes Back (1992).
Super Star Wars (1992) was released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, with two sequels over the next two years.

====
LucasArts and modern self-published games (1993–2014) ====
Lucasfilm founded its own video game company in 1982, becoming best known for adventure games and World War II flight combat games, but as George Lucas took more interest in the increasing success of the video game market, he wanted to have more creative control over the games and founded his own development company, LucasArts.
Improved graphics allowed games to tell complex narratives, which allowed for the retelling of the films, and eventually original narratives set in the same continuity, with voice-overs and CGI cutscenes.
In 1993, LucasArts released Star Wars: X-Wing, the first self-published Star Wars video game and the first space flight simulator based on the franchise.
It was one of the best-selling video games of 1993 and established its own series of games.
The Rogue Squadron series was released between 1998 and 2003, also focusing on space battles set during the films.

Dark Forces (1995), a hybrid adventure game incorporating puzzles and strategy, was the first Star Wars first-person shooter.
It featured gameplay and graphical features not then common in other games, made possible by LucasArts' custom-designed game engine, the Jedi.
The game was well received, and it was followed by four sequels.
The series introduced Kyle Katarn, who would appear in multiple games, novels, and comics.
Katarn is a former stormtrooper who joins the Rebellion and becomes a Jedi, a plot arc similar to that of Finn in the sequel trilogy films.
A massively multiplayer online role-playing game, Star Wars Galaxies, was in operation from 2003 until 2011.
After Disney bought Lucasfilm, LucasArts ceased its role as a developer in 2013, although it still operates as a licensor.

====
EA Star Wars (2014–present) ====
Following its acquisition of the franchise, Disney reassigned video game rights to Electronic Arts.
Games made during this era are considered canonical, and feature more influence from the Star Wars filmmakers.
Disney partnered with Lenovo to create the augmented reality video game Jedi Challenges, released in November 2017.
In August 2018, it was announced that Zynga would publish free-to-play Star Wars mobile games.
The Battlefront games received a canonical reboot in 2017.
Jedi:
Fallen Order was released in November 2019 and Star Wars:
Squadrons was released in October 2020.

===
Theme park attractions ===
In addition to the Disneyland ride Star Tours (1987) and its successor, Star Tours: The Adventures Continue (2011), many live attractions have been held at Disney parks, including the travelling exhibition Where Science Meets Imagination, the Space Mountain spin-off Hyperspace Mountain, a walkthrough Launch Bay, and the night-time A Galactic Spectacular.
An immersive themed area called Galaxy's Edge (2019) opened at Disneyland and opened at Walt Disney World in mid-2019.

A themed hotel, Star Wars:
Galactic Starcruiser, is currently under construction at Walt Disney World.

===
Multimedia projects ===
A multimedia project involves works released across multiple types of media.
Shadows of the Empire (1996) was a multimedia project set between The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi that included a novel by Steve Perry, a comic book series, a video game, and action figures.
The Force Unleashed (2008–2010) was a similar project set between Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope that included a novel, a 2008 video game and its 2010 sequel, a graphic novel, a role-playing game supplement, and toys.

===
Merchandising ===
The success of the Star Wars films led the franchise to become one of the most merchandised franchises in the world.
While filming the original 1977 film, George Lucas decided to take a $500,000 pay cut to his salary as director in exchange for full ownership of the franchise's merchandising rights.
By 1987, the first three films have made US$2.6 billion in merchandising revenue.
By 2012, the first six films produced approximately US$20 billion in merchandising revenue.
Kenner made the first Star Wars action figures to coincide with the release of the original film, and today the original figures are highly valuable.
Since the 1990s, Hasbro holds the rights to create action figures based on the saga.
Pez dispensers began to be produced in 1997.
Star Wars was the first intellectual property to be licensed in Lego history.
Lego has produced animated parody short films and mini-series to promote their Star Wars sets.
The Lego Star Wars video games are critically acclaimed bestsellers.
In 1977, the board game Star Wars: Escape from the Death Star was released.
A Star Wars Monopoly and themed versions of Trivial Pursuit and Battleship were released in 1997, with updated versions released in subsequent years.
The board game Risk has been adapted in two editions by Hasbro:
The Clone Wars Edition (2005) and the Original Trilogy Edition (2006).
Three Star Wars tabletop role-playing games have been developed: a version by West End Games in the 1980s and 1990s, one by Wizards of the Coast in the 2000s, and one by Fantasy Flight Games in the 2010s.

Star Wars Trading Cards have been published since the first "blue" series, by Topps, in 1977.
Dozens of series have been produced, with Topps being the licensed creator in the United States.
Each card series are of film stills or original art.
Many of the cards have become highly collectible with some very rare "promos", such as the 1993 Galaxy Series II "floating Yoda" P3 card often commanding US$1,000 or more.
While most "base" or "common card" sets are plentiful, many "insert" or "chase cards" are very rare.
From 1995 until 2001, Decipher, Inc. had the license for, created, and produced the Star Wars Customizable Card Game.

==
Themes ==
Star Wars features elements such as knighthood, chivalry, and Jungian archetypes such as "the shadow".

There are also many references to Christianity, such as in the appearance of Darth Maul, whose design draws heavily from traditional depictions of the devil.
Anakin was conceived of a virgin birth, and is assumed to be the "Chosen One", a messianic individual.
However, unlike Jesus, Anakin falls from grace, remaining evil as Darth Vader until Return of the Jedi.
According to Adam Driver, sequel
trilogy villain Kylo Ren, who idolizes Vader, believes he is "doing what he thinks is right".
George Lucas has said that the theme of the saga is redemption.
The saga draws heavily from the hero's journey, an archetypical template developed by comparative mythologist Joseph Campbell.
Each character—primarily Anakin, Luke, and Rey—follows the steps of the cycle or undergoes its reversal, becoming the villain.
A defining step of the journey is "Atonement with the Father".
Obi-Wan's loss of a father figure could have impacted his relationship with Anakin, whom both Obi-Wan and Palpatine are fatherlike mentors to.
Luke's discovery that Vader is his father has strong repurcussions on the saga and is regarded as one of the most influential plot twists in cinema.
Supreme Leader Snoke encourages Kylo Ren to kill his father, Han Solo.
Kylo uses the fact that Rey is an orphan to tempt her into joining the dark side.
According to Inverse, the final scene in The Last Jedi, which depicts servant children playing with a toy of Luke and one boy using the Force, symbolizes that "the Force can be found in people with humble beginnings."
===
Historical influences ===
Political science has been an important element of Star Wars since the franchise launched in 1977, focusing on a struggle between democracy and dictatorship.
Battles featuring the Ewoks and Gungans against the Empire and Trade Federation, respectively, represent the clash between a primitive society and a more advanced one, similar to the Vietnam-American War.
Darth Vader's design was initially inspired by Samurai armor, and also incorporated a German military helmet.
Originally, Lucas conceived of the Sith as a group that served the Emperor in the same way that the Schutzstaffel served Adolf Hitler; this was condensed into one character in the form of Vader.
Stormtroopers borrow the name of World War I German "shock" troopers.
Imperial officers wear uniforms resembling those of German forces during World War II, and political and security officers resemble the black-clad SS down to the stylized silver death's head on their caps.
World War II terms were used for names in the films; e.g. the planets Kessel (a term that refers to a group of encircled forces) and Hoth (after a German general who served on the snow-laden Eastern Front).
Shots of the commanders looking through AT-AT walker viewscreens in The Empire Strikes Back resemble tank interiors, and space battles in the original film were based on World War I and World War II dogfights.
Palpatine being a chancellor before becoming the Emperor in the prequel
trilogy alludes to Hitler's role before appointing himself Führer.
Lucas has also drawn parallels to historical dictators such as Julius Caesar, Napoleon Bonaparte, and politicians like Richard Nixon.
The Great Jedi Purge mirrors the events of the Night of the Long Knives.
The corruption of the Galactic Republic is modeled after the fall of the democratic Roman Republic and the formation of an empire.
On the inspiration for the First Order formed "from the ashes of the Empire", The Force Awakens
director J. J. Abrams spoke of conversations the writers had about how the Nazis could have escaped to Argentina after WWII and "started working together again."

==
Cultural impact ==
The Star Wars saga has had a significant impact on popular culture, with references to its fictional universe deeply embedded in everyday life.
Phrases like "evil empire" and
"May the Force be with you" have become part of the popular lexicon.
The first Star Wars film in 1977 was a cultural unifier, enjoyed by a wide spectrum of people.
The film can be said to have helped launch the science-fiction boom of the late 1970s and early 1980s, making science-fiction films a mainstream genre.
The widespread impact made it a prime target for parody works and homages, with popular examples including Hardware Wars, Spaceballs, The Family Guy Trilogy and Robot Chicken: Star Wars.

In 1989, the Library of Congress selected the original Star Wars film for preservation in the U.S. National Film Registry, as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant."
The Empire Strikes Back, was selected in 2010.
35mm reels of the 1997 Special Editions were the versions initially presented for preservation because of the difficulty of transferring from the original prints, but it was later revealed that the Library possesses a copyright deposit print of the original theatrical releases.

===
Industry ===
The original Star Wars film was a huge success for 20th Century Fox, and was credited for reinvigorating the company.
Within three weeks of the film's release, the studio's stock price doubled to a record high.
Prior to 1977, 20th Century Fox's greatest annual profits were $37 million, while in 1977, the company broke that record by posting a profit of $79 million.
The franchise helped Fox to change from an almost bankrupt production company to a thriving media conglomerate.
Star Wars fundamentally changed the aesthetics and narratives of Hollywood films, switching the focus of Hollywood-made films from deep, meaningful stories based on dramatic conflict, themes and irony to sprawling special-effects-laden blockbusters, as well as changing the Hollywood film industry in fundamental ways.
Before Star Wars, special effects in films had not appreciably advanced since the 1950s.
The commercial success of Star Wars created a boom in state-of-the-art special effects in the late 1970s.
Along with Jaws, Star Wars started the tradition of the summer blockbuster film in the entertainment industry, where films open on many screens at the same time and profitable franchises are important.
It created the model for the major film trilogy and showed that merchandising rights on a film could generate more money than the film itself did.
Film critic Roger Ebert wrote in his book The Great Movies, "Like The Birth of a Nation and Citizen Kane, Star Wars was a technical watershed that influenced many of the movies that came after.
"
It began a new generation of special effects and high-energy motion pictures.
The film was one of the first films to link genres together to invent a new, high-concept genre for filmmakers to build upon.
Finally, along with Steven Spielberg's Jaws, it shifted the film industry's focus away from personal filmmaking of the 1970s and towards fast-paced, big-budget blockbusters for younger audiences.
Some critics have blamed Star Wars and Jaws for "ruining" Hollywood by shifting its focus from "sophisticated" films such as The Godfather, Taxi Driver, and Annie Hall to films about spectacle and juvenile fantasy, and for the industry shift from stand-alone, one and done films, towards blockbuster franchises with multiple sequels and prequels.
One such critic, Peter Biskind, complained, "When all was said and done, Lucas and Spielberg returned the 1970s audience, grown sophisticated on a diet of European and New Hollywood films, to the simplicities of the pre-1960s Golden Age of movies...
They marched backward through the looking-glass.
"
In an opposing view, Tom Shone wrote that through Star Wars and Jaws, Lucas and Spielberg "didn't betray cinema at all: they plugged it back into the grid, returning the medium to its roots as a carnival sideshow, a magic act, one big special effect", which was "a kind of rebirth".
The original Star Wars trilogy is widely considered one of the best film trilogies in history.
Numerous filmmakers have been influenced by Star Wars, including Damon Lindelof, Dean Devlin, Roland Emmerich, John Lasseter, David Fincher, Joss Whedon, John Singleton, Kevin Smith, and later Star Wars directors J. J. Abrams and Gareth Edwards.
Lucas's concept of a "used universe" particularly influenced Ridley Scott's Blade Runner (1982) and Alien (1979), James Cameron's Aliens (1986) as well as The Terminator (1984), George Miller's Mad Max 2 (1981), and Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings trilogy (2001–2003).
Christopher Nolan cited Star Wars as an influence when making the 2010 blockbuster film Inception.

====
Fan works ====
The Star Wars saga has inspired many fans to create their own non-canon material set in the Star Wars galaxy.
In recent years, this has ranged from writing fan fiction to creating fan films.
In 2002, Lucasfilm sponsored the first annual Official Star Wars Fan Film Awards, officially recognizing filmmakers and the genre.
Because of concerns over potential copyright and trademark issues, however, the contest was initially open only to parodies, mockumentaries, and documentaries.
Fan fiction films set in the Star Wars universe were originally ineligible, but in 2007, Lucasfilm changed the submission standards to allow in-universe fiction entries.
Lucasfilm has allowed but not endorsed the creation of fan fiction, as long as it does not attempt to make a profit.

===
Academia ===
As the characters and the storyline of the original trilogy are so well known, educators have used the films in the classroom as a learning resource.

For example, a project in Western Australia honed elementary school students storytelling skills by role-playing action scenes from the movies and later creating props and audio/visual scenery to enhance their performance.

Others have used the films to encourage second-level students to integrate technology in the science classroom by making prototype lightsabers.
Similarly, psychiatrists in New Zealand and the US have advocated their use in the university classroom to explain different types of psychopathology.

Star Wars (retroactively titled Star Wars:
Episode IV  –
A New Hope) is a 1977 American epic space-opera film written and directed by George Lucas, produced by Lucasfilm and distributed by 20th Century Fox.
It stars Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Peter Cushing, Alec Guinness, David Prowse, James Earl Jones, Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker and Peter Mayhew.
It is the first installment of the original Star Wars trilogy, the first of the franchise to be produced, and the fourth episode of the "Skywalker saga".

Lucas had the idea for a science-fiction film in the vein of Flash Gordon around the time he completed his first film, THX 1138 (1971) and began working on a treatment after the release of American Graffiti (1973).
Star Wars focuses on the journey of Luke Skywalker (Hamill), who along with the wizened Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi (Guinness), smuggler Han Solo (Ford), and his Wookiee companion Chewbacca (Mayhew), attempts to free Princess Leia (Fisher) from the clutches of the tyrannical Galactic Empire.
At the same time, the heroes try to deliver the plans for the Empire's planet-destroying space station, the Death Star, which are carried by the droids R2-D2 (Baker) and C-3PO (Daniels), to the Rebel Alliance, but face opposition from the Sith Lord Darth Vader (Prowse, voiced by Jones).

After a turbulent production, Star Wars was released in a limited number of theaters in the United States on May 25, 1977, and quickly became a blockbuster hit, leading to it being expanded to a much wider release.
The film opened to critical acclaim, most notably for its groundbreaking visual effects.
It grossed a total of $775 million (over $550million initial run), surpassing Jaws (1975) to become the highest-grossing film at the time until the release of E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982).
When adjusted for inflation, Star Wars is the second-highest-grossing film in North America (behind Gone with the Wind) and the fourth-highest-grossing film in the world.
It received ten Oscar nominations (including Best Picture), winning seven.
In 1989, it became one of the first 25 films that was selected by the U.S. Library of Congress for preservation in the National Film Registry for being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".
At the time, it was the most recent film in the registry and the only one chosen from the 1970s.
In 2004, its soundtrack was added to the U.S. National Recording Registry, and was additionally listed by the American Film Institute as the best movie score of all time a year later.
Today, it is widely regarded by many in the motion picture industry as one of the greatest and most important films in motion picture history.

The film has been reissued multiple times with Lucas's support—most significantly with its 20th-anniversary theatrical "Special Edition"—incorporating many changes including modified computer-generated effects, altered dialogue, re-edited shots, remixed soundtracks and added scenes.
The film became a pop-cultural phenomenon and launched an industry of tie-in products, including novels, comics, video games, amusement park attractions, and merchandise including toys, games, clothing and many other spin-off works.

The film's success led to two critically and commercially successful sequels, The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983), and later to a prequel trilogy, a sequel trilogy, two anthology films and various spin-off TV series.

Plot ==
Amid a galactic civil war, Rebel Alliance spies have stolen plans  to the Galactic Empire's Death Star, a massive space station capable of destroying an entire planet.
Imperial Senator Princess Leia of Alderaan, secretly one of the Rebellion's leaders, has obtained its schematics, but her starship is intercepted by an Imperial Star Destroyer under the command of the ruthless Darth Vader.
Before she is captured, Leia hides the plans in the memory of astromech droid R2-D2, who flees in an escape pod to the desert planet Tatooine accompanied by protocol droid C-3PO.

The droids are captured by Jawa traders, who sell them to moisture farmers Owen and Beru Lars and their nephew Luke Skywalker.
While Luke is cleaning R2-D2 part of a holographic recording of Leia starts playing, a message for Obi-Wan Kenobi where she requests his help.
Later, after Luke finds R2-D2 missing, he is attacked by scavenging Sand People while searching for him, but is rescued by elderly hermit "Old Ben" Kenobi, an acquaintance of Luke's, who reveals that "Obi-Wan" is his true name.
Obi-Wan tells Luke of his days as one of the Jedi Knights, the former peacekeepers of the Galactic Republic who drew mystical abilities from a metaphysical energy field known as "the Force", but were ultimately hunted to near-extinction by the Empire.
Luke learns that his father fought alongside Obi-Wan as a Jedi Knight during the Clone Wars until Vader, Obi-Wan's former pupil, turned to the dark side of the Force and murdered him.
Obi-Wan presents Luke with his father's old lightsaber, the signature weapon of Jedi Knights.

R2-D2 plays Leia's full message, in which she begs Obi-Wan to take the Death Star plans to her home planet of Alderaan and give them to her father, a fellow veteran, for analysis.
Although Luke initially declines Obi-Wan's offer to accompany him to Alderaan and learn the ways of the Force, he is left with no choice after discovering that Imperial stormtroopers have killed his aunt and uncle and destroyed their farm in their search for the droids.
Traveling to a cantina in Mos Eisley to search for transport, Luke and Obi-Wan hire Han Solo, a smuggler with a price on his head due to his debt to local mobster Jabba the Hutt.
Pursued by stormtroopers, Obi-Wan, Luke, R2-D2 and C-3PO flee Tatooine with Han and his Wookiee co-pilot Chewbacca on their ship the Millennium Falcon.
As they reach the planet's orbit, two Star Destroyers try to intercept them, but Han is able to jump to hyperspace by reaching lightspeed.

Before the Falcon can reach Alderaan, Death Star commander Grand Moff Tarkin interrogates Leia about the location of the Rebels's secret base, with the threat of destroying her home planet, and, when she answers that the base is on Dantooine, he orders Alderaan destroyed simply as a show of force.
As the group arrives in the asteroid field that now stands in place of Alderaan, Han spots an Imperial TIE fighter and is taunted into chasing it and shooting it down, allowing the Falcon to be captured by the space station's tractor beam.
Inside the Death Star, Obi-Wan attempts to disable the tractor beam, and Luke persuades Han and Chewbacca to help him rescue Leia after discovering that she is scheduled to be executed.
After disabling the tractor beam, Obi-Wan sacrifices his life in a lightsaber duel with Vader, allowing the rest of the group to escape the Death Star with Leia.
Using a tracking device, the Empire tracks the Falcon to the hidden Rebel base, actually located on Yavin IV.

Leia's schematics reveal a hidden weakness in the Death Star's thermal exhaust port, which could allow the Rebels to trigger a chain reaction in its main reactor with a precise torpedo strike.
While Han abandons the Rebels after collecting his reward for rescuing Leia, Luke joins their starfighter squadron in a desperate attack against the approaching Death Star.
In the ensuing battle, the Rebels suffer heavy losses as Vader leads a squadron of TIE fighters against them, but Han unexpectedly returns to aid them in the Falcon, narrowly managing to save Luke before Vader can shoot him down.
Guided by the disembodied voice of Obi-Wan's spirit, Luke turns off his targeting computer and uses the Force to aim his torpedoes into the exhaust port, destroying the Death Star moments before it fires on the Rebel base.
In a triumphant ceremony at the base, Leia awards Luke and Han medals for their heroism.

== Cast ==
Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker: A young adult raised by his aunt and uncle on Tatooine, who dreams of something more than his current life and learns the way of the Jedi.
Lucas favored casting young actors who lacked long experience.
To play Luke (then known as Luke Starkiller), Lucas sought actors who could project intelligence and integrity.
While reading the script, Hamill found the dialogue to be extremely odd because of its universe-embedded concepts.
He chose to simply read it sincerely, and he was cast instead of William Katt, who was subsequently cast in Brian De Palma's Carrie (Lucas shared a joint casting session with De Palma, a longtime friend).

Harrison Ford as Han Solo: A cynical smuggler hired by Obi-Wan and Luke
to take them to Alderaan in his ship, the Millennium Falcon, co-piloted with Chewbacca.
Lucas initially rejected casting Ford for the role, as he "wanted new faces"; Ford had previously worked with Lucas on American Graffiti.
Instead, Lucas asked Ford to assist in the auditions by reading lines with the other actors and explaining the concepts and history behind the scenes that they were reading.
Lucas was eventually won over by Ford's portrayal and cast him instead of Kurt Russell, Nick Nolte, Sylvester Stallone, Bill Murray, Christopher Walken, Burt Reynolds, Jack Nicholson, Al Pacino, Steve Martin, Chevy Chase, or Perry King (who later played Han Solo in the radio plays).

Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia: A member of the Imperial Senate and one of the many Leaders of the Rebel Alliance.
Many young Hollywood actresses auditioned for the role of Princess Leia, including Amy Irving, Terri Nunn (also a singer), Cindy Williams, Karen Allen, and Jodie Foster.
Foster, for one, turned down the role because she was already under contract with Disney and working on two films at the time.
Fisher was cast under the condition that she lose 10 pounds (4.5 kg) for the role.

Peter Cushing as Grand Moff Tarkin: Commander of the Death Star.
Lucas originally had Cushing in mind for the role of Obi-Wan Kenobi, but Lucas believed that "his lean features" would be better employed in the role of Grand Moff Tarkin instead.
Lucas commended Cushing's performance, saying "[He] is a very good actor.
Adored and idolized by young people and by people who go to see a certain kind of movie.
I feel he will be fondly remembered for the next 350 years at least.
"
Cushing, commenting on his role, joked: "I've often wondered what a 'Grand Moff' was.
It sounds like something that flew out of a cupboard."

Alec Guinness as Obi-Wan Kenobi:
An aging Jedi Master and former mentor of Darth Vader who introduces Luke to the Force.
Lucas' decision to cast "unknowns" was not taken favorably by his friend Francis Ford Coppola and the studio.
Lucas felt Obi-Wan Kenobi should be played by an established actor.
Producer Gary Kurtz said, "The Alec Guinness role required a certain stability and gravitas as a character... which meant we needed a very, very strong character actor to play that part."
Before Guinness was cast, Japanese actor Toshiro Mifune (who starred in many Akira Kurosawa films) was considered for the role.
According to Mifune's daughter, Mika Kitagawa, her father turned down Lucas' offers for Kenobi and Darth Vader because "he was concerned about how the film would look and that it would cheapen the image of samurai...
At the time, sci-fi movies still looked quite cheap as the effects were not advanced and he had a lot of samurai pride.
"
Guinness was one of the few cast members who believed that the film would be successful; he negotiated a deal for 2.25% of the one-fifth gross royalties paid to Lucas, which made him quite wealthy in later life.
He agreed to take the part of Kenobi on the condition that he would not have to do any publicity to promote the film.
Lucas credited him with inspiring the cast and crew to work harder, saying that Guinness contributed significantly to the completion of the filming.
Harrison Ford said, "It was, for me, fascinating to watch Alec Guinness.
He was always prepared, always professional, always very kind to the other actors.
He had a very clear head about how to serve the story."

Anthony Daniels as C-3PO: A protocol droid who is "fluent in over six million forms of communication".
Daniels auditioned for and was cast as C-3PO; he has said that he wanted the role after he saw a Ralph McQuarrie drawing of the character and was struck by the vulnerability in the robot's face.
Initially, Lucas did not intend to use Daniels' voice for C-3PO.
Thirty well-established voice actors read for the voice of the droid.
According to Daniels, one of the major voice actors, believed by some sources to be Stan Freberg, recommended Daniels' voice for the role.

Kenny Baker as R2-D2:
An astromech droid who is carrying the Death Star plans and a secret message for Obi-Wan from Princess Leia.
When filming was underway in London, where additional casting took place, Baker, performing a musical comedy act with his acting partner Jack Purvis, learned that the film crew was looking for a small person to fit inside a robot suit and maneuver it.
Baker, who was 3 feet 8 inches (1.12 m) tall, was cast immediately after meeting George Lucas.
He said, "He saw me come in and said 'He'll do' because I was the smallest guy they'd seen up until then."
He initially turned down the role three times, hesitant to appear in a film where his face would not be shown and hoping to continue the success of his comedy act, which had recently started to be televised.
R2-D2's recognizable beeps and squeaks were made by sound designer Ben Burtt imitating "baby noises", recording this voice as it was heard on an intercom, and creating the final mix using a synthesizer.

Peter Mayhew as Chewbacca "Chewie":
A 200-year-old Wookiee, Han Solo's sidekick, and first mate of the Millennium Falcon.
Mayhew learned of a casting call for Star Wars, which was being shot in London, and decided to audition.
The 7-foot-3-inch (2.21 m)
tall actor was immediately cast as Chewbacca after he stood up to greet Lucas.
He recounted, "I sat down on one of the sofas, waiting for George.
Door opened, and George walked in with Gary behind him.
So, naturally, what did I do?
I'm raised in England.
Soon as someone comes in through the door, I stand up.
George goes 'Hmm [looked up].'
Virtually turned to Gary, and said 'I think we've found him.'
As a result of his height, Mayhew was eligible for either the role of Chewbacca or Darth Vader, ultimately choosing the former because he wanted to play a hero in the story.
Mayhew modeled his performance of Chewbacca after the mannerisms of animals he saw at public zoos.
David Prowse as Darth Vader: A Sith lord of the Galactic Empire who aims to destroy the Rebel Alliance.

James Earl Jones as the voice of Darth Vader.
Lucas originally intended for Orson Welles to voice the character after dismissing Prowse due to his West Country English accent (which led to him being nicknamed, within the cast, as "Darth Farmer").
However, determining that Welles' voice would be too familiar to audiences, Lucas instead cast then-relatively less recognizable Jones.
Other actors include Phil Brown and Shelagh Fraser as Luke's Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru; Jack Purvis, Kenny Baker's partner in his London comedy act, as the Chief Jawa in the film; and Eddie Byrne as Vanden Willard, a Rebel general.
Denis Lawson and Garrick Hagon played rebel pilots Wedge Antilles and Biggs Darklighter (Luke's childhood friend), respectively.
Don Henderson and Leslie Schofield appear as Imperial Generals Cassio Tagge and Moradmin Bast, respectively, and Richard LeParmentier plays Admiral Motti.
Alex McCrindle portrays General Jan Dodonna, Alfie Curtis portrays Dr. Evazan, and Peter Geddis portrays Captain Raymus Antilles.
Michael Leader plays a minor role as a Stormtrooper known for accidentally hitting his helmet against a door.
Heavily synthesised audio recordings of John Wayne from earlier films were used as the voice of the Imperial spy Garindan.
Robert Clarke plays Wulff Yularen, an Imperial officer known more for his appearance in the Clone Wars.

Development ===
Lucas had the idea for a space-fantasy film in 1971, after he completed directing his first full-length feature, THX 1138.
Originally, Lucas wanted to adapt the Flash Gordon space adventure comics and serials into his own films, having been fascinated by them since he was young.

He later said:

I especially loved the Flash Gordon serials ...
Of course I realize now how crude and badly done they were ...
loving them that much when they were so awful, I began to wonder what would happen if they were done really well.

At the Cannes Film Festival following the completion of THX 1138, Lucas pushed towards buying the Flash Gordon rights, but they were already tied-up with Dino De Laurentiis.
Lucas later recounted:

I wanted to make a Flash Gordon movie, with all the trimmings, but I couldn't obtain the rights to the characters.
So I began researching and went right back and found where Alex Raymond (who had done the original Flash Gordon comic strips in newspapers) had got his idea from.
I discovered that he'd got his inspiration from the works of Edgar Rice Burroughs (author of Tarzan) and especially from his John Carter of Mars series books.
I read through that series, then found that what had sparked Burroughs off was a science fantasy called Gulliver on Mars, written by Edwin Arnold and published in 1905.
That was the first story in this genre that I have been able to trace.
Jules Verne had got pretty close, I suppose, but he never had a hero battling against space creatures or having adventures on another planet.
A whole new genre developed from that idea.

Director Francis Ford Coppola, who accompanied Lucas in trying to buy the Flash Gordon rights, recounted in 1999: "
[George] was very depressed because he had just come back
and they wouldn't sell him Flash Gordon.
And he says, 'Well, I'll just invent my own.'"
He secured a two-film development deal with United Artists; the two films were American Graffiti and a space opera, tentatively titled "The Star Wars" and inspired by Flash Gordon.
Lucas would later claim that he had the idea for an original space opera long before 1971, and that he even tried to film it before American Graffiti.
Believing that the bleak tone of THX 1138 led to its poor reception, Lucas chose to make Star Wars more optimistic; this is what led to its fun and adventurous tone.

Lucas went to United Artists and showed them the script for American Graffiti, but they passed on the film, which was then picked up by Universal Pictures.
United Artists also passed on Lucas' space-opera concept, which he shelved for the time being.
After spending the next two years completing American Graffiti, Lucas turned his attention to his space opera.
He drew inspiration from politics of the era, later saying, “It was really about the Vietnam War, and that was the period where Nixon was trying to run for a [second] term.
"Lucas began writing in January 1973, "eight hours a day, five days a week", by taking small notes, inventing odd names and assigning them possible characterizations.
Lucas would discard many of these by the time the final script was written, but he included several names and places in the final script or its sequels.
He used these initial names and ideas to compile a two-page synopsis titled Journal of the Whills, which told the tale of the training of apprentice CJ Thorpe as a "Jedi-Bendu" space commando by the legendary Mace Windy.
Frustrated that his story was too difficult to understand, Lucas then began writing a 13-page treatment called The Star Wars on April 17, 1973, which had narrative parallels with Kurosawa's 1958 film The Hidden Fortress.
While impressed with the "innocence of the story, plus the sophistication of the world" of the film, United Artists declined to budget the film.
Lucas and producer Gary Kurtz presented the film treatment to Universal Pictures, the studio that financed American Graffiti; while they agreed it could be "a very commercial venture", they had doubts about Mr. Lucas' ability to pull it all off," and said that Lucas should follow American Graffiti with more consequential themes.
Walt Disney Productions also turned down the film.

Lucas said, "I've always been an outsider to Hollywood types.
They think I do weirdo films."
According to Kurtz, Lew Wasserman, the studio's head, "just didn't think much of science fiction at that time, didn't think it had much of a future then, with that particular audience."
He said that "science fiction wasn't popular in the mid-'70s ...
what seems to be the case generally is that the studio executives are looking for what was popular last year, rather than trying to look forward to what might be popular next year."
Kurtz said, "Although Star Wars wasn't like [then-current science fiction] at all, it was just sort of lumped into that same kind of category.
"Lucas explained in 1977 that the film is not "about the future" and that it "is a fantasy much closer to the Brothers Grimm than it is to 2001."
He added: "My main reason for making it was to give young people an honest, wholesome fantasy life, the kind my generation had.
We had Westerns, pirate movies, all kinds of great things.
Now they have The Six Million Dollar Man and Kojak.
Where are the romance, the adventure, and the fun that used to be in practically every movie made?"
Lucas would later recontextualize the discussion around the film, saying it was born out of research into "psychological underpinings of mythology", a claim that had been dismissed by Kurtz as self-aggrandizing: "
The whole idea of Star Wars as a mythological thing, I think came about because of [later Lucas] interviews that tied it to The Hero with a Thousand Faces" and by Steven Hart and Michael Kaminski: "It is here that the true origin of Star Wars comes from -- not from myth and legend, but from the 'schlock' sold on newspapers stands and played in matinees.
"There were also concerns regarding the project's potentially high budget.
Lucas and Kurtz, in pitching the film, said that it would be "low-budget, Roger Corman style, and the budget was never going to be more than—
well, originally we had proposed about 8 million, it ended up being about 10.
Both of those figures are very low budget by Hollywood standards at the time."
After Disney rejected the project, Lucas and Kurtz persisted in securing a studio to support the film because "other people had read it and said, 'Yeah, it could be a good idea.'
"
Lucas pursued Alan Ladd Jr., the head of 20th Century-Fox, and in June 1973 completed a deal to write and direct the film.
Although Ladd did not grasp the technical side of the project, he believed that Lucas was talented.
Lucas later stated that Ladd "invested in me, he did not invest in the movie."
The deal gave Lucas $150,000 to write and direct the film.
American Graffiti's positive reception afforded Lucas the leverage necessary to renegotiate his deal with Ladd and request the sequel rights to the film in August 1973.
For Lucas, this deal protected Star Wars's potential sequels and most of the merchandising profits.

===
Writing ===
Since commencing his writing process in January 1973, Lucas had done "various rewrites in the evenings after the day's work."
He would write four different screenplays for Star Wars, "searching for just the right ingredients, characters and storyline.
It's always been what you might call a good idea in search of a story.
"
By May 1974, he had expanded the treatment for The Star Wars into a rough draft screenplay, adding elements such as the Sith, the Death Star, and a general by the name of Annikin Starkiller.
He changed Starkiller to an adolescent boy, and he shifted the general into a supporting role as a member of a family of dwarfs.
Lucas envisioned the Corellian smuggler, Han Solo, as a large, green-skinned monster with gills.
He based Chewbacca on his Alaskan Malamute dog, Indiana (whom he would later use as eponym for his character Indiana Jones), who often acted as the director's "co-pilot" by sitting in the passenger seat of his car.
Lucas completed a second draft in January 1975 as Adventures of the Starkiller, Episode One: The Star Wars, making heavy simplifications and introducing the young hero on a farm as Luke Starkiller.
Annikin became Luke's father, a wise Jedi knight.
"
The Force" was also introduced as a mystical energy field.
This draft still had some differences from the final version in the characters and relationships.
For example, Luke had several brothers, as well as his father, who appears in a minor role at the end of the film.
The script became more of a fairy tale quest as opposed to the action/adventure of the previous versions.
This version ended with another text crawl, previewing the next story in the series.
This draft was also the first to introduce the concept of a Jedi turning to the dark side: the draft included a historical Jedi who was the first to ever fall to the dark side, and then trained the Sith to use it.
The script would introduce the concept of a Jedi Master and his son, who trains to be a Jedi under his father's friend; this would ultimately form the basis for the film and, later, the trilogy.
However, in this draft, the father is a hero who is still alive at the start of the film.
Han Solo and Chewbacca's identities closely resembled those seen in the finished film.
According to Lucas, the second draft was over 200 pages long, and led him to split up the story into multiple films spanning over multiple trilogies.
Lucas began to rewrite this draft, creating a synopsis for the third draft.
During work on this rewrite, Lucas began researching the science-fiction genre by watching films and reading books (including J. R. R. Tolkien's The Hobbit) and comics.
He also claims to have read scholastic works like Joseph Campbell's The Hero with a Thousand Faces, James George Frazer's The Golden Bough, and even Bruno Bettelheim's The Uses of Enchantment.
These claims are doubted by Michael Kaminski and Chris Taylor, with Kaminski pointing out that Bettelheim's book would not come out until after Star Wars was filmed and adding that "the original trilogy-Campbell connection is greatly exaggerated and practically non-existent", noting that, in fact, the second draft is "even closer to Campbell's structure" than the third.
According to Lucas, he wrote a rough draft of about 250–300 pages long, which contained the outline for the entire original Star Wars trilogy.
He realized that it was too long for a single film, and decided to subdivide it into a trilogy.
Lucas stated that the story evolved over time and that "There was never a script completed that had the entire story as it exists now [in 1983] ...
As the stories unfolded, I would take certain ideas and save them ...
I kept taking out all the good parts, and I just kept telling myself I would make other movies someday."
He later described that, having split the script into three episodes, "the first part didn't really work", so he had to take the ending off of Episode VI and put it in the original Star Wars, which resulted in a Death Star being included in both films.

In 1975 Lucas suggested he could make a trilogy, which "ends with the destruction of the Empire" and a possible prequel "about the backstory of Kenobi as a young man."
After the film's smash success, Lucasfilm announced that Lucas had already written "twelve stories in the Adventures of Luke Skywalker" which, according to Kurtz, were set to be "separate adventures rather than direct sequels.
"During
the writing of the third draft, Lucas hired conceptual artist Ralph McQuarrie to create paintings of certain scenes, several of which Lucas included with his screenplay when he delivered it to 20th Century-Fox.
On February 27, the studio granted a budget of $5 million; this was later increased to $8.25 million.
Subsequently, Lucas started writing with a budget in mind, conceiving the cheap, "used" look of much of the film, and (with Fox having just shut down its special effects department) reducing the number of complex special effects shots called for by the script.

The third draft, dated August 1, 1975, was titled The Star Wars From the Adventures of Luke Starkiller.
This third draft had most of the elements of the final plot, with only some differences in the characters and settings.
The draft characterized Luke as an only child, with his father already dead, replacing him with a substitute named Ben Kenobi.
This script would be re-written for the fourth and final draft, dated January 1, 1976, as The Adventures of Luke Starkiller as taken from the Journal of the Whills, Saga I:
The Star Wars.
Lucas worked with his friends Gloria Katz and Willard Huyck to revise the fourth draft into the final pre-production script.
Lucas finished writing his script in March 1976, when the crew started filming.
He said, "What finally emerged through the many drafts of the script has obviously been influenced by science-fiction and action-adventure
I've read and seen.
And I've seen a lot of it.
I'm trying to make a classic sort of genre picture, a classic space fantasy in which all the influences are working together.
There are certain traditional aspects of the genre I wanted to keep and help perpetuate in Star Wars."
During production, he changed Luke's name from Starkiller to Skywalker and altered the title to The Star Wars and later Star Wars.
He would also continue to tweak the script during filming, including adding the death of Obi-Wan after realizing he served no purpose in the ending of the film.
For the film's opening crawl, Lucas originally wrote a composition consisting of six paragraphs with four sentences each.
He said, "The crawl is such a hard thing because you have to be careful that you're not using too many words that people don't understand.
It's like a poem.
"
Lucas showed his draft to his friends.
Director Brian De Palma, who was there, described it: "
The crawl at the beginning looks like it was written on a driveway.
It goes on forever.
It's gibberish."
Lucas recounted what De Palma said the first time he saw it: "George, you're out of your mind!
Let me sit down and write this for you."
De Palma and Jay Cocks helped edit the text into the form used in the film.
===
Design ===
George Lucas recruited many conceptual designers, including Colin Cantwell, who worked on 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), to conceptualize the initial spacecraft models; Alex Tavoularis to create the preliminary conceptual storyboard sketches of early scripts; and Ralph McQuarrie to visualize the characters, costumes, props and scenery.
McQuarrie's pre-production paintings of certain scenes from Lucas's early screenplay drafts helped 20th
Century-Fox visualize the film, which positively influenced their decision to fund the project.
After McQuarrie's drawings for Lucas's colleagues Hal Barwood and Matthew Robbins (who were collaborating for a film) caught his interest, Lucas met with McQuarrie to discuss his plans for the untitled space fantasy film he wanted to make.
Two years later, after completing American Graffiti, Lucas approached McQuarrie and asked him if he would be interested "in doing something for Star Wars."
McQuarrie produced a series of artworks from simple sketches; these set a visual tone for the film, and for the rest of the original trilogy.

The film was ambitious as Lucas wanted to create fresh prop prototypes and sets (based on McQuarrie's paintings) that had never been realized before in science fiction films.
He commissioned production designers John Barry and Roger Christian, who were working on the sets of the film Lucky Lady (1975) when Lucas first approached them, to work on the production sets.
Christian recounted in 2014: "George came to the set I was doing, it was an old salt factory design
and he helped me shovel salt, just like two students in plaid shirts and sneakers.
And we spoke and he looked at the set and couldn't believe it wasn't real.
"
They had a conversation with Lucas on what he would like the film to appear like, with them creating the desired sets.
Christian said that Lucas "didn't want anything [in Star Wars] to stand out, he wanted it [to look] all real and used.
And I said, 'Finally somebody's doing it the right way.
'"Lucas described a "used future" concept to the production designers in which all devices, ships, and buildings to do with Tatooine or the Rebels looked aged and dirty, as opposed to the sleeker designs of the Empire.
Lucas also wanted the spaceships to look "cobbled together, as opposed to a sleek monoshape."
Barry said that the director "wants to make it look like it's shot on location on your average everyday
Death Star or Mos Eisley Spaceport or local cantina.
"
Lucas believed that "what is required for true credibility is a used future", opposing the interpretation of "future in most futurist movies" that "always looks new and clean and shiny."
Christian supported Lucas's vision, saying "All science fiction before was very plastic and stupid uniforms and Flash Gordon stuff.
Nothing was new.
George was going right against that.
"The
designers started working with the director before Star Wars was approved by 20th Century-Fox.
For four to five months, in a studio in Kensal Rise, England, they attempted to plan the creation of the props and sets with "no money."
Although Lucas initially provided funds using his earnings from American Graffiti, it was inadequate.
As they could not afford to dress the sets, Christian was forced to use unconventional methods and materials to achieve the desired look.
He suggested that Lucas use scrap in making the dressings, and the director agreed.
Christian said, "I've always had this idea.
I used to do it with models when I was a kid.
I'd stick things on them and we'd make things look old."
Barry, Christian, and their team began designing the props and sets at Elstree Studios.
According to Christian, the Millennium Falcon set was the most difficult to build.
Christian wanted the interior of the Falcon to look like that of a submarine.
He found scrap airplane metal "that no one wanted in those days and bought them."
He began his creation process by breaking down jet engines into scrap pieces, giving him the chance to "stick it in the sets in specific ways.
"
It took him several weeks to finish the chess set (which he described as "the most encrusted set") in the hold of the Falcon.
The garbage compactor set "was also pretty hard, because I knew I had actors in there
and the walls had to come in, and they had to be in dirty water
and I had to get stuff that would be light enough so it wouldn't hurt them but also not bobbing around.
"
A total of 30 sets consisting of planets, starships, caves, control rooms, cantinas, and the Death Star corridors were created; all of the nine sound stages at Elstree were used to accommodate them.
The massive rebel hangar set was housed at a second sound stage at Shepperton Studios; the stage was the largest in Europe at the time.

===
Filming ===
In 1975, Lucas formed his own visual effects company Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) after discovering that 20th Century-Fox's visual effects department had been disbanded.
ILM began its work on Star Wars in a warehouse in Van Nuys.
Most of the visual effects used pioneering digital motion control photography developed by John Dykstra and his team, which created the illusion of size by employing small models and slowly moving cameras.
George Lucas tried "to get a cohesive reality" for his feature.
However, since the film is a fairy tale, as he had described, "I still wanted it to have an ethereal quality, yet be well composed and, also, have an alien look."
He designed the film to have an "extremely bizarre, Gregg Toland-like surreal look with strange over-exposed colors, a lot of shadows, a lot of hot areas.
"
Lucas wanted Star Wars to embrace the combination of "strange graphics of fantasy" and "the feel of a documentary" to impress a distinct look.
To achieve this, he hired the British cinematographer Gilbert Taylor.
Originally, Lucas's first choice for the position was Geoffrey Unsworth, who also provided the cinematography for Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey.
Unsworth was interested in working with the director, and initially accepted the job when it was offered to him by Lucas and Kurtz.
However, he eventually withdrew to work on the Vincente Minnelli-directed A Matter of Time (1976)
instead, which "really annoy[ed]" Kurtz.
Lucas called up for other cinematographers, and eventually chose Taylor, basing his choice on Taylor's cinematography for Dr. Strangelove and A Hard Day's Night (both 1964).
On his decision, Lucas said: "I thought they were good, eccentrically photographed pictures with a strong documentary flavor.
"Taylor said that Lucas, who was consumed by the details of the complicated production, "avoided all meetings and contact with me from day one, so I read the extra-long script many times and made my own decisions as to how I would shoot the picture."
Taylor also said, "I took it upon myself to experiment with photographing the lightsabers and other things onstage before we moved on to our two weeks of location work in Tunisia.
"
Taylor was aware of the "enormous amount of process work" to follow principal photography and believed "a crisp result would help.
"During production, Lucas and Taylor—whom Kurtz called "old-school" and "crotchety"—had disputes over filming.
With a background in independent filmmaking, Lucas was accustomed to creating most of the elements of the film himself.
His lighting suggestions were rejected by Taylor, who believed that Lucas was overstepping his boundaries by giving specific instructions, sometimes even moving lights and cameras himself.
Taylor refused to use the soft-focus lenses and gauze Lucas wanted after Fox executives complained about the look.
Kurtz stated that "In a couple of scenes ... rather than saying, 'It looks a bit over lit, can you fix that?', [
Lucas would] say, 'turn off this light, and turn off that light.'
And Gil would say, 'No, I won't do that
, I've lit it the way I think it should be—tell me what's the effect that you want, and I'll make a judgment about what to do with my lights.'"

Originally, Lucas envisioned the planet of Tatooine, where much of the film would take place, as a jungle planet.
Gary Kurtz traveled to the Philippines to scout locations; however, because of the idea of spending months filming in the jungle would make Lucas "itchy", the director refined his vision and made Tatooine a desert planet instead.
Kurtz then researched all American, North African, and Middle Eastern deserts, and found Tunisia, near the Sahara desert, as the ideal location.
Lucas later stated that he had wanted to make it look like outer space.
When principal photography began on March 22, 1976, in the Tunisian desert for the scenes on Tatooine, the project faced several problems.
Lucas fell behind schedule in the first week of shooting due to malfunctioning props and electronic breakdowns.
Moreover, a rare Tunisian rainstorm struck the country, which further disrupted filming.
Taylor said, "you couldn't really see where the land ended and the sky began.
It was all a gray mess, and the robots were just a blur.
"
Given this situation, Lucas requested heavy filtration, which Taylor rejected, who said: "I thought the look of the film should be absolutely clean ...
But George saw it differently, so we tried using nets and other diffusion.
He asked to set up one shot on the robots with a 300mm, and the sand and sky just mushed together.
I told him it wouldn't work, but he said that was the way he wanted to do the entire film, all diffused.
"
This difference was later settled by 20th Century-Fox executives, who backed Taylor's suggestion.
Filming began in Chott el Djerid, while a construction crew in Tozeur took eight weeks to transform the desert into the desired setting.
Other locations included the sand dunes of the Tunisian desert near Nafta, where a scene featuring a giant skeleton of a creature lying in the background as R2-D2 and C-3PO make their way across the sands was filmed.
When actor Anthony Daniels wore the C-3PO outfit for the first time in Tunisia, the left leg piece shattered down through the plastic covering his left foot, stabbing him.
He also could not see through his costume's eyes, which was covered with gold to prevent corrosion.
Abnormal radio signals caused by the Tunisian sands made the radio-controlled R2-D2 models run out of control.
Kenny Baker, who portrayed R2-D2, said: "I was incredibly grateful each time an [R2] would actually work right."
After several scenes were filmed against the volcanic canyons outside Tozeur, production moved to Matmata to film Luke's home on Tatooine.
Lucas chose Hotel Sidi Driss, which is larger than the typical underground dwellings, to shoot the interior of Luke's homestead.
Additional scenes for Tatooine were filmed at Death Valley in North America.

After two-and-a-half weeks of filming in Tunisia, production moved to Elstree Studios, near London, to film interior scenes.
Elstree was chosen as a studio over other options in Hollywood or elsewhere.
Star Wars required the use of nine different sound stages simultaneously, which most studios couldn't accommodate.
Because of stricter working conditions, filming in Britain had to finish by 5:30 pm, unless Lucas was in the middle of a scene.
Despite Lucas's efforts, his crew had little interest in the film.
Most of the crew considered the project a "children's film", rarely took their work seriously, and often found it unintentionally humorous.
Actor Baker later confessed that he thought the film would be a failure.
Harrison Ford found it strange that "there's a princess with weird buns in her hair", and called Chewbacca a "giant in a monkey suit.
"The
Elstree sets designed by John Barry, according to Gilbert Taylor, "were like a coal mine."
He said that "they were all black and gray, with really no opportunities for lighting at all."
To resolve the problem, he worked the lighting into the sets by chopping in its walls, ceiling and floors.
This would result in "a 'cut-out' system of panel lighting", with quartz lamps that could be placed in the holes in the walls, ceiling and floors.
His idea was supported by the Fox studio, which agreed that "we couldn't have this 'black hole of Calcutta.'
"
The lighting approach Taylor devised "allowed George to shoot in almost any direction without extensive relighting, which gave him more freedom."
In total, the filming in Britain took 14-and-a-half weeks.

Lucas commissioned computer programmer Larry Cuba to create the animated Death Star plans shown at the rebel base on Yavin 4.
This was written with the GRASS programming language, exported to a Vector General monitor and filmed on 35 mm to be rear-projected on the set.
It is the only computer animation in the original version of the film.
The Yavin scenes were filmed in the Mayan temples at Tikal, Guatemala.
Lucas selected the location as a potential filming site after seeing a poster of it hanging at a travel agency while he was filming in Britain.
This inspired him to send a film crew to Guatemala in March 1977 to shoot scenes.
While filming in Tikal, the crew paid locals with a six-pack of beer to watch over the camera equipment for several days.
While shooting, Lucas rarely spoke to the actors, who believed that he expected too much of them while providing little direction.
His directions to the actors usually consisted of the words "faster" and "more intense".
Kurtz stated that "it happened a lot where he would just say, 'Let's try it again a little bit faster.'
That was about the only instruction he'd give anybody.
A lot of actors don't mind—
they don't care, they just get on with it.
But some actors really need a lot of pampering and a lot of feedback, and if they don't get it, they get paranoid that they might not be doing a good job."
Kurtz has said that Lucas "wasn't gregarious, he's very much a loner and very shy, so he didn't like large groups of people
, he didn't like working with a large crew, he didn't like working with a lot of actors.
"Ladd offered Lucas some of the only support from the studio; he dealt with scrutiny from board members over the rising budget and complex screenplay drafts.
Initially, Fox approved $8 million for the project; Gary Kurtz said: "we proceeded to pick a production plan and do a more final budget with a British art department and look for locations in North Africa, and kind of pulled together some things.
Then, it was obvious that 8 million wasn't going to do it—they had approved 8 million."
After requests from the team that "it had to be more," the executives "got a bit scared.
"
For two weeks, Lucas and his crew "didn't really do anything except kind of pull together new budget figures.
"
At the same time, after production fell behind schedule, Ladd told Lucas he had to finish production within a week
or he would be forced to shut down production.
Kurtz said that "it came out to be like 9.8 or .9 or something like that, and in the end they just said, 'Yes, that's okay
, we'll go ahead.'
"
The crew split into three units, with those units led by Lucas, Kurtz, and production supervisor Robert Watts.
Under the new system, the project met the studio's deadline.
During production, the cast attempted to make Lucas laugh or smile, as he often appeared depressed.
At one point, the project became so demanding that Lucas was diagnosed with hypertension and exhaustion and was warned to reduce his stress level.
Post-production was equally stressful due to increasing pressure from 20th Century-Fox.
Moreover, Mark Hamill's car accident left his face visibly scarred, which restricted re-shoots.

===
Post-production ===
Star Wars was originally slated for release on Christmas 1976; however, its production delays pushed the film's release to mid-1977.
Editor John Jympson began cutting the film together while Lucas was still filming in Tunisia; as Lucas noted, the editor was in an "impossible position" because Lucas had not explained any of the film's material to him.
When Lucas watched Jympson's rough cut for the first time, he disliked what he saw.
J. W. Rinzler wrote that "Jympson's selection of takes was questionable, and he seemed to be having trouble doing match-cuts.
"
Lucas was prepared to give Jympson more time; Jympson disliked Lucas' working style.
As production went on, Lucas still disapproved of Jympson's cut and fired him halfway through the film's production.
He commented: "Unfortunately it didn't work out.
It's very hard when you are hiring people to know if they are going to mesh with you
and if you are going to get what you want.
In the end, I don't think he fully understood the movie and
what I was trying to do.
I shoot in a very peculiar way, in a documentary style, and it takes a lot of hard editing to make it work."
After attempting to persuade Jympson to cut the film his way, Lucas replaced him with Paul Hirsch, Richard Chew and his then-wife, Marcia Lucas, who was also cutting the film New York, New York (1977) with Lucas's friend Martin Scorsese.
Richard Chew considered the film to  have been cut in a slow, by-the-book manner: scenes were played out in master shots that flowed into close-up coverage.
He found that the pace was dictated by the actors instead of the cuts.
Hirsch and Chew worked on two reels simultaneously.
Jympson's original assembly contained a large amount of footage which differed from the final cut of the film, including several alternate takes and a number of scenes which were subsequently deleted to improve the narrative pace.
The most significant material cut was a series of scenes from the first part of the film which introduced Luke Skywalker.
These early scenes, set in Anchorhead on the planet Tatooine, presented the audience with Luke's everyday life among his friends as it is affected by the space battle above the planet; they also introduced the character of Biggs Darklighter, Luke's closest friend who departs to join the rebellion.
Chew explained the rationale behind removing these scenes as a narrative decision: "In the first five minutes, we were hitting everybody with more information than they could handle.
There were too many story lines to keep straight: the robots and the Princess, Vader, Luke.
So we simplified it by taking out Luke and Biggs.
"
In an examination of this early cut, which has come to be called the "Lost Cut", David West Reynolds noted the film adopted a "documentary-like" approach that emphasized "clarity, especially in geographic and spatial relationships" over "dramatic or artistic concerns".
As a result, the film was more "leisurely paced".
Reynolds estimated this early cut contained "30-40%" different footage from the final cut, with most of the differences coming from extended cuts or alternate takes rather than deleted scenes.
After viewing a rough cut, Alan Ladd likened the early Anchorhead scenes to "American Graffiti in outer space.
"
Lucas was looking for a way of accelerating the storytelling, and removing Luke's early scenes would distinguish Star Wars from his earlier teenage drama and "get that American Graffiti feel out of it."
Lucas also stated that he wanted to move the narrative focus to C-3PO and R2-D2: "At the time, to have the first half-hour of the film be mainly about robots was a bold idea.
"Meanwhile, Industrial Light & Magic was struggling to achieve unprecedented special effects.
The company had spent half of its budget on four shots that Lucas deemed unacceptable.
With hundreds of uncompleted shots remaining, ILM was forced to finish a year's work in six months.
Lucas inspired ILM by editing together aerial dogfights from old war films, which enhanced the pacing of the scenes.
Sound designer Ben Burtt had created a library of sounds that Lucas referred to as an "organic soundtrack."
Blaster sounds were a modified recording of a steel cable, under tension, being struck.
The lightsaber sound effect was developed by Burtt as a combination of the hum of idling interlock motors in aged movie projectors and interference caused by a television set on a shieldless microphone.
Burtt discovered the latter accidentally as he was looking for a buzzing, sparking sound to add to the projector-motor hum.
For Chewbacca's growls, Burtt recorded and combined sounds made by dogs, bears, lions, tigers, and walruses to create phrases and sentences.
Lucas and Burtt created the robotic voice of R2-D2 by filtering their voices through an electronic synthesizer.
Darth Vader's breathing was achieved by Burtt breathing through the mask of a scuba regulator implanted with a microphone, which began the idea of Vader having been a burn-victim, which was not the case during production.
In February 1977, Lucas screened an early cut of the film for Fox executives, several director friends, along with Roy Thomas and Howard Chaykin of Marvel Comics who were preparing a Star Wars comic book.
The cut had a different crawl from the finished version and used Prowse's voice for Darth Vader.
It also lacked most special effects; hand-drawn arrows took the place of blaster beams, and when the Millennium Falcon fought TIE fighters, the film cut to footage of World War II dogfights.
The reactions of the directors present, such as Brian De Palma, John Milius, and Steven Spielberg, disappointed Lucas.
Spielberg, who said he was the only person in the audience to have enjoyed the film, believed that the lack of enthusiasm was due to the absence of finished special effects.
Lucas later said that the group was honest and seemed bemused by the film.
In contrast, Ladd and the other studio executives loved the film; Gareth Wigan told Lucas: "This is the greatest film I've ever seen" and cried during the screening.
Lucas found the experience shocking and rewarding, having never gained any approval from studio executives before.
The delays increased the budget from $8 million to $11 million.
With the project $2 million over budget, Lucas was forced to make numerous artistic compromises to complete Star Wars.
Ladd reluctantly agreed to release an extra $20,000 funding and in early 1977 second unit filming completed a number of sequences including exterior desert shots for Tatooine in Death Valley and China Lake Acres in California, and exterior Yavin jungle shots in Guatemala, along with additional studio footage to complete the Mos Eisley Cantina sequence.

Lucas had to write around a scene featuring a human Jabba the Hutt, which was scrapped due to not being in focus.
Lucas would later claim he wanted to superimpose a stop-motion creature over the actor - which he did in the 1997 Special Edition with a computer-generated version of Jabba.
However, all the script drafts (with the exception of one that Lucas doctored after the fact) describe Jabba as humanoid, the notion of him being an alien not having come up until work on the 1979 re-release, and scrapped until the Special Edition.

==
Soundtrack ==
On the recommendation of his friend Steven Spielberg, George Lucas hired composer John Williams.
Williams had worked with Spielberg on the film Jaws, for which he won an Academy Award.
Lucas originally hired Williams to consult on music editing choices and to compose the source music for the music, telling Williams that he intends to use extant music.
Lucas believed that the film would portray visually foreign worlds, but that the musical score would give the audience an emotional familiarity; he wanted a grand musical sound for Star Wars.
Therefore, Lucas assembled his favorite orchestral pieces for the soundtrack, until Williams convinced him that an original score would be unique and more unified, having viewed Lucas' music choices as a temp track.
However, a few of Williams' eventual pieces were influenced by the temp track: the "Main Title Theme" was inspired by the theme from the 1942 film Kings Row, scored by Erich Wolfgang Korngold; and the track "Dune Sea of Tatooine" drew from the soundtrack of Bicycle Thieves, scored by Alessandro Cicognini.
Lucas would later deny having ever conceived using extant music for the film.
In March 1977, Williams conducted the London Symphony Orchestra to record the Star Wars soundtrack in 12 days.
The original soundtrack was released as a double LP in 1977 by 20th Century Records.
20th Century Records also released The Story of Star Wars that same year, a narrated audio drama adaptation of the film utilizing some of its original music, dialogue, and sound effects.
The American Film Institute's list of best film scores ranks the Star Wars soundtrack at number one.

==
Cinematic and literary allusions ==
According to George Lucas, different concepts of the film were inspired by numerous sources, such as Beowulf and King Arthur for the origins of myth and religion.
Lucas had originally intended to remake the 1930s Flash Gordon film serials, but was unable to obtain the rights; thus, he resorted to drawing from Akira Kurosawa's 1958 film The Hidden Fortress and, allegedly, Joseph Campbell's The Hero with a Thousand Faces.
Star Wars features many elements derived from Flash Gordon, such as the conflict between rebels and Imperial Forces, the wipes between scenes, the fusion of futuristic technology and traditional mythology, and the famous opening crawl that begins each film.
The film has also been compared to The Wizard of Oz.
The influence of The Hidden Fortress can be seen in the relationship between C-3PO and R2-D2, which evolved from the two bickering peasants, Tahei and Matashichi, and a Japanese family crest seen in the earlier film is similar to the Imperial Crest.
Star Wars also borrows heavily from another Kurosawa film, Yojimbo (1961).
In both films, several men threaten the hero, bragging about how wanted they are by the authorities, and have an arm being cut off by a blade; Kuwabatake Sanjuro (played by Toshiro Mifune) is offered "twenty-five ryo now, twenty-five when you complete the mission", whereas Han Solo is offered "Two thousand now, plus fifteen when we reach Alderaan.
"
Its sequel Sanjuro (1962) also inspired the hiding-under-the-floor trick featured in the film.
Another source of influence was Lawrence of Arabia (1962), which inspired the film's visual approach, including long-lens desert shots.
There are also thematic parallels, including the freedom fight by a rebel army against an empire, and politicians who meddle behind the scenes.
Tatooine is similar to the desert planet of Arrakis from Frank Herbert's Dune series.
Arrakis is the only known source of a longevity spice; Star Wars makes references to spice in "the spice mines of Kessel", and a spice freighter.
Other similarities include those between Princess Leia and Princess Alia, and Jedi mind tricks and "The Voice", a controlling ability used by the Bene Gesserit.
In passing, Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru are "moisture farmers"; in Dune, dew collectors are used by Fremen to "provide a small but reliable source of water."
Frank Herbert reported that "David Lynch, [director of the 1984 film Dune] had trouble with the fact that Star Wars used up so much of Dune.
"
The pair found "sixteen points of identity" and they calculated that "the odds against coincidence produced a number larger than the number of stars in the universe.
"The
Death Star assault scene was modeled after the World War II film The Dam Busters (1955), in which Royal Air Force Lancaster bombers fly along heavily defended reservoirs and aim bouncing bombs at dams, in order to cripple the heavy industry of Germany's Ruhr region.
Some of the dialogue in The Dam Busters is repeated in the Star Wars climax; Gilbert Taylor also filmed the special effects sequences in The Dam Busters.
In addition, the sequence was partially inspired by the climax of the film 633 Squadron (1964), directed by Walter Grauman, in which RAF de Havilland Mosquitos attack a German heavy water plant by flying down a narrow fjord to drop special bombs at a precise point, while avoiding anti-aircraft guns and German fighters.
Clips from both films were included in Lucas's temporary dogfight footage version of the sequence.
There are also similarities in the Death Star trench sequence to the bridge attack scene in The Bridges at Toko-Ri.
The opening shot of Star Wars, in which a detailed spaceship fills the screen overhead, is a reference to the scene introducing the interplanetary spacecraft Discovery One in Stanley Kubrick's seminal 1968 film 2001: A Space Odyssey.
The earlier big-budget science fiction film influenced the look of Star Wars in many other ways, including the use of EVA pods and hexagonal corridors.
The Death Star has a docking bay reminiscent of the one on the orbiting space station in 2001.
Although golden and male, C-3PO was inspired by the silver female robot Maria, the Maschinenmensch from Fritz Lang's 1927 film Metropolis.

==
Marketing ==
While the film was in production, a logo was commissioned from Dan Perri, a title sequence designer who had worked on the titles for films such as The Exorcist (1973) and Taxi Driver (1976).
Perri devised a foreshortened STAR WARS logotype consisting of block-capital letters filled with stars and skewed towards a vanishing point.
This logo design was originally conceived to follow the same perspective as the film's opening crawl.
In the end, Perri's logo was not used for the film's opening title sequence, although it was used widely on pre-release print advertising and on cinema marquees.
The logotype eventually selected for on-screen use originated in a promotional brochure that was distributed by Fox to cinema owners in 1976.
This brochure was designed by Suzy Rice, a young art director at the Los Angeles advertising agency Seiniger Advertising.
On a visit to ILM in Van Nuys, Rice was instructed by Lucas to produce a logo that would intimidate the viewer, and he reportedly asked for the logo to appear "very fascist" in style.
Rice's response to her brief was to use an outlined, modified Helvetica Black.
After some feedback from Lucas, Rice decided to join the S and T of STAR and the R and S of WARS.
Lucas signed off on the brochure in between takes while filming inserts for the Mos Eisley Cantina scene.
Gary Kurtz was impressed with Rice's logo and selected it over Perri's design for the film's opening titles, after modifying the letter W to flatten the pointed tips originally designed by Rice.
This finalized the design of one of the most recognizable logos in cinema design, although Rice's contribution was not credited in the film.
For the US release in 1977, 20th Century-Fox commissioned a promotional film poster from the advertising agency Smolen, Smith and Connolly.
They used the freelance artist Tom Jung who was given the brief of "good over evil."
His poster, known as Style ‘A’, depicted Luke Skywalker standing in a heroic pose, brandishing a shining lightsaber above his head, with Princess Leia below him, and a large, ghostly image of Darth Vader's helmet looming behind them.
Some Fox executives considered this poster "too dark" and commissioned the Brothers Hildebrandt, a pair of well-known fantasy artists, to rework the poster for the UK release.
When the film opened in British theaters, the Hildebrandts' Style ‘B’ poster was used in cinema billboards.
Fox and Lucasfilm subsequently decided that they wanted to promote the new film with a less stylized and more realistic depiction of the lead characters.
Producer Gary Kurtz turned to the film poster artist Tom Chantrell, who was already well known for his prolific work for Hammer horror films, and commissioned a new version.
Two months after Star Wars opened, the Hildebrandts' poster was replaced by Chantrell's Style ‘C’ poster in UK cinemas.
Charles Lippincott was the marketing director for Star Wars.
As 20th Century-Fox gave little support for marketing beyond licensing T-shirts and posters, Lippincott was forced to look elsewhere.
He secured deals with Marvel Comics for a comic book adaptation, and with Del Rey Books for a novelization.
A fan of science fiction, he used his contacts to promote the film at the San Diego Comic-Con and elsewhere within science-fiction fandom.

Release ==
While initially being released only in a limited theatrical run, Star Wars was an unprecedented success for 20th Century-Fox, soon becoming a blockbuster hit and expanding to a much wider release.
It would eventually see many theatrical and home video re-releases.

===
Premiere and initial release ===
Worried that Star Wars would be beaten out by other summer films, such as Smokey and the Bandit, 20th Century-Fox moved the release date to May 25, the Wednesday before Memorial Day.
However, fewer than 40 theaters ordered the film to be shown.
In response, the studio demanded that theaters order Star Wars if they wanted the eagerly anticipated The Other Side of Midnight based on Sidney Sheldon's 1973 novel by the same name.

Star Wars debuted on Wednesday, May 25, 1977, in fewer than 32 theaters, and eight more on Thursday and Friday.
Kurtz said in 2002, "That would be laughable today.
"
It immediately broke box office records, effectively becoming one of the first blockbuster films, and Fox accelerated plans to broaden its release.
Lucas himself was not able to predict how successful Star Wars would be.
After visiting the set of the Steven Spielberg film Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Lucas was sure Close Encounters would outperform the yet-to-be-released Star Wars at the box office.
Spielberg disagreed, and believed Star Wars would be the bigger hit.
Lucas proposed they trade 2.5% of the profit on each other's films; Spielberg took the trade, and still receives 2.5% of the profits from Star Wars.
Amidst Fox pessimism, Lucas elected to forgo his option to an extra $500,000 fee for directing Star Wars, in exchange for releasing ownership of the merchandising and sequel rights for the movie to Fox.
The Other Side of Midnight was supposed to be the studio's big summer hit, while Lucas's movie was considered the "B track" for theater owners nationwide.
While Fox requested Mann's Chinese Theatre, the studio promised that the film needed only two weeks.

Fearing that the film would fail, Lucas had made plans to be in Hawaii with his wife Marcia.
Having forgotten that the film would open that day, he spent most of Wednesday in a sound studio in Los Angeles.
When Lucas went out for lunch with Marcia, they encountered a long line of people along the sidewalks leading to Mann's Chinese Theatre, waiting to see Star Wars.
He was still skeptical of the film's success, even with enthusiastic reports from Ladd and the studio.
While in Hawaii, it was not until he watched Walter Cronkite discuss the gigantic crowds for Star Wars on the CBS Evening News that Lucas realized he had become very wealthy.
Francis Ford Coppola, who needed money to finish Apocalypse Now, sent a telegram to Lucas's hotel asking for funding.
Even technical crew members, such as model makers, were asked for autographs, and cast members became instant household names; when Ford visited a record store to buy an album, enthusiastic fans tore half his shirt off.
The film was a huge success for 20th Century-Fox, and was credited for reinvigorating the company.
Within three weeks of the film's release, the studio's stock price had doubled to a record high.
Prior to 1977, 20th Century-Fox's greatest annual profits were $37 million, while in 1977, the company broke that record by posting a profit of $79 million.
Although the film's cultural neutrality helped it to gain international success, Ladd became anxious during the premiere in Japan.
After the screening, the audience was silent, leading him to fear that the film would be unsuccessful.
Ladd was reassured by his local contacts that this was a positive reaction considering that in Japan, silence was the greatest honor to a film, and the subsequent strong box office returns confirmed its popularity.
After two weeks William Friedkin's Sorcerer replaced Star Wars at Mann's Chinese Theatre because of contractual obligations; Mann Theatres moved the film to a less-prestigious location after quickly renovating it.
When Star Wars made an unprecedented second opening at Mann's Chinese Theatre on August 3, 1977, after Sorcerer failed, thousands of people attended a ceremony in which C-3PO, R2-D2 and Darth Vader placed their footprints in the theater's forecourt.
At that time Star Wars was playing in 1,096 theaters in the United States.
Approximately 60 theaters played the film continuously for over a year; in 1978, Lucasfilm distributed "Birthday Cake" posters to those theaters for special events on May 25, the one-year anniversary of the film's release.
Star Wars premiered in the UK on December 27, 1977.
News reports of the film's popularity in America caused long lines to form at the two London theaters that first offered the film; it became available in 12 large cities in January 1978, and other London theaters in February.

===
Theatrical re-releases ===
Star Wars was re-released theatrically in 1978, 1979, 1981 and 1982, with the subtitle Episode IV – A New Hope being added in 1981.
The film was digitally remastered with some altered scenes in 1997 for a theatrical rerelease, dubbed the "Special Edition."

Since its original release, the film has also been dubbed and subtitled into numerous languages.

In 2010, Lucas announced that all six previously released Star Wars films would be scanned and transferred to 3D for a theatrical release, but only 3D versions of the prequel trilogy were completed before the franchise was sold to Disney in 2012.

In 2013, Star Wars was dubbed into Navajo, making it the first major motion picture translated into a Native American language.

====
Inclusion of subtitles ====
The texts Episode IV and A New Hope were first published on a title page for the film's script in the 1979 book The Art of Star Wars, in what Kaminski calls "outright forgery", remarking that "the script itself wasn't even the authentic revised fourth draft, but more like a transcription of the finished film, edited and combined with the real fourth draft.
"
The title was changed when the film entered re-releases.
Official sources state that the change was made at the theatrical re-release of April 10
, 1981.The retronymic inclusion of subtitles brought the film into line with the introduction to its sequel, The Empire Strikes Back, which was reconcieved during rewrites as "Episode V" and eventually released as such in 1980.
Lucas claims this was intended from the beginning, and was only dropped to avoid confusing audiences: "
Star Wars was the fourth story in the saga and was to have been called 'Star Wars, Episode Four:
A New Hope'.
"
In 2014, Kurtz recalled they had toyed with the idea "of calling it Episode III, IV, or V.
" Hamill recalls having asked Lucas "Why are we doing episode four?"
and being answered that Lucas wanted "to give the audience a feeling that they'd missed something and that they were coming into the middle of this story" or that it was "the most commercial section" of the overriding story.
Kaminski, however, points out that all early drafts carry an "Episode One" subtitle, and that even early drafts of the sequel are called "Episode II."
====
Special Edition ====
After ILM used computer-generated effects for Steven Spielberg's 1993 film Jurassic Park, Lucas decided that digital technology had caught up to his "original vision" for Star Wars.
For the film's 20th anniversary in 1997, Star Wars was digitally remastered with some altered scenes and re-released to theaters, along with The Empire
Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi
, under the campaign title Star Wars Trilogy: Special Edition.
This version of the film runs 124 minutes.

The Special Edition contains visual shots and scenes that were unachievable in the original release due to financial, technological, and time constraints; one such scene involves a meeting between Han Solo and Jabba the Hutt.
The process of creating the new visual effects for Star Wars was featured in the documentary film, Special Effects:
Anything Can Happen, directed by Star Wars sound designer Ben Burtt.
Although most changes are minor or cosmetic in nature, many fans and critics believe that Lucas degraded the film with the additions.
A particularly controversial change in which a bounty hunter named Greedo shoots first when confronting Han Solo has inspired T-shirts bearing the phrase "Han Shot First.
"Star
Wars required extensive recovery of misplaced footage and restoration of the whole film before Lucas's Special Edition modifications could be attempted.
It was discovered that in addition to the negative motion picture stocks commonly used on feature films, Lucas had also used Color Reversal Internegative (CRI) film, a reversal stock subsequently discontinued by Kodak.
CRI proved to deteriorate faster than negative stocks did, although it theoretically was of higher quality, as it saved two generations (an interpositive followed by an internegative), where employed.
Because of this, the entire composited negative had to be disassembled, and the CRI portions cleaned separately from the negative portions.
Once the cleaning was complete, the film was scanned into the computer for restoration.
In many cases, entire scenes had to be reconstructed from their individual elements.
Digital compositing technology allowed the restorers to correct for problems such as misalignment of mattes and "blue-spill.
"In
1989
, the 1977 theatrical version of Star Wars was selected for preservation by the National Film Registry of the United States Library of Congress.
35mm reels of the 1997 Special Edition were initially presented for preservation because of the difficulty of transferring from the original prints, but it was later revealed that the Library possessed a copyright deposit print of the original theatrical release.
By 2015, this copy had been transferred to a 2K scan, now available to be viewed by appointment.

===
Home media ===
In the United States, France, West Germany, Italy and Japan, parts of or the whole film were released on Super 8.
The whole film was released for all these countries (including subtitled silent editions and an American Spanish-language edition), except for Italy, where the film (titled "Guerre stellari") was released by IE International as eight brief scenes: Battaglia spaziale ("Space battle", the Battle of Yavin), Duello col laser ("Duel with the laser", Obi-Wan and Darth Vader's duel), La cattura dell'astronave
("The capture of the spaceship"), La liberazione di Leia ("Leia's liberation", the adventure on the Death Star), Messaggio dallo spazio ("Message from space", Leia giving R2-D2 the plans), SOS nella galassia ("SOS in the galaxy") and Trappola mortale ("Deadly trap", the Falcon being captured by the Death Star).
A full Super 8 version of the film was only made available in Italy as a pirate six-reel set.
Star Wars debuted on Betamax, CED, LaserDisc, Video 2000, and VHS between the 1980s and 1990s by CBS/Fox Video.
The final issue of the original theatrical release (pre-Special Edition) to VHS format occurred in 1995, as part of "Last Chance to Own the Original" campaign, available as part of a trilogy set and as a standalone purchase.
The film was released for the first time on DVD on September 21, 2004, in a box set with The Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi, and a bonus disc of supplementary material.
The films were digitally restored and remastered, and more changes were made by Lucas.
The DVD features a commentary track from Lucas, Ben Burtt, Dennis Muren, and Carrie Fisher.
The bonus disc contains the documentary Empire of Dreams: The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy, three featurettes, teasers, theatrical trailers, TV spots, still galleries, an exclusive preview of Episode III: Revenge of the Sith, a playable Xbox demo of the LucasArts game Star Wars: Battlefront, and a making-of documentary on the Episode III video game.
The set was reissued in December 2005 as part of a three-disc limited edition boxed set without the bonus disc.
The trilogy was re-released on separate two-disc limited edition DVD sets from September 12 to December 31, 2006, and again in a limited edition tin box set on November 4, 2008; the original versions of the films were added as bonus material.
The release was met with criticism as the unaltered versions were from the 1993 non-anamorphic LaserDisc masters and were not re-transferred using modern video standards.
The transfer led to problems with colors and digital image jarring.
All six Star Wars films were released by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment on Blu-ray Disc on September 16, 2011 in three different editions, with A New Hope available in both a box set of the original trilogy and with all six films on Star Wars:
The Complete Saga, which includes nine discs and over 40 hours of special features.
The original theatrical versions of the films were not included in the box set.
New changes were made to the films, provoking mixed responses.
On April 7, 2015, Walt Disney Studios, 20th Century Fox, and Lucasfilm jointly announced the digital releases of the six released Star Wars films.
Fox released A New Hope for digital download on April 10, 2015.
In December 2016, Rogue One director Gareth Edwards revealed that Lucasfilm had recently completed a 4K restoration of Star Wars, but did not elaborate on whether the restored version was based on the 1977 original or a subsequent re-release.
Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment reissued the film on Blu-ray, DVD, and digital download on September 22, 2019.
Additionally, all six films were available for 4K HDR and Dolby Atmos streaming on Disney+ upon the service's launch on November 12, 2019.
This version of the film was released by Disney on 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray box set on March 31, 2020.

Box office ===
Star Wars remains one of the most financially successful films of all time.
The film opened on a Wednesday in 32 theaters expanding to 43 screens on the Friday and earning $2,556,418 in its first six days to the end of the Memorial Day weekend ($10.8 million in 2019 dollars).
Per Variety's weekly box office charts, the film was number one at the US box office for its first three weeks.
It was replaced by The Deep but gradually added screens and returned to number one in its seventh week, building up to $7 million weekends as it entered wide release ($29.5 million in 2019 dollars) and remained number one for the next 15 weeks.
It replaced Jaws as the highest-earning film in North America just six months into release, eventually earning over $220 million during its initial theatrical run ($928 million in 2019 dollars).
Star Wars entered international release towards the end of the year, and in 1978 added the worldwide record to its domestic one, earning $410 million in total.
Its biggest international market was Japan, where it grossed $58.4 million.
On July 21, 1978 while still in current release in 38 theaters in the U.S., the film expanded into a 1,744 theater national saturation windup of release and set a new U.S. weekend record of $10,202,726.
The gross prior to the expansion was $221,280,994.
The expansion added a further $43,774,911 to take its gross to $265,055,905.
Reissues in 1979 ($22,455,262), 1981 ($17,247,363), and 1982 ($17,981,612) brought its cumulative gross in the U.S and Canada to $323 million, and extended its global earnings to $530 million.
The film remained the highest-grossing film of all time until E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial broke that record in 1983.The release of the Special Edition in 1997 was the highest-grossing reissue of all-time with a gross of $138.3 million, bringing its total gross in the United States and Canada to $460,998,007, reclaiming the all-time number one spot.
Internationally, the reissue grossed $117.2 million, with $26 million from the United Kingdom and $15 million from Japan.
In total, the film has grossed over $775 million worldwide.
Adjusted for inflation, it had earned over $2.5 billion worldwide at 2011 prices, which saw it ranked as the third-highest-grossing film at the time, according to Guinness World Records.
At the North American box office, it ranks second behind Gone with the Wind on the inflation-adjusted list.

Critical response ===
The film was met with critical acclaim upon its release.
In his 1977 review, Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times called the film "an out-of-body experience," compared its special effects to those of 2001: A Space Odyssey, and opined that the true strength of the film was its "pure narrative."
Vincent Canby of The New York Times called the film "the movie that's going to entertain a lot of contemporary folk who have a soft spot for the virtually ritualized manners of comic-book adventure" and "the most elaborate, most expensive, most beautiful movie serial ever made."
A.D. Murphy of Variety described the film as "magnificent" and said George Lucas had succeeded in his attempt to create the "biggest possible adventure fantasy" based on the serials and older action epics from his childhood.
Writing for The Washington Post, Gary Arnold gave the film a positive review, writing that the film "is a new classic in a rousing movie tradition: a space swashbuckler."
However, the film was not without its detractors: Pauline Kael of The New Yorker criticized Star Wars, stating that "there's no breather in the picture, no lyricism", and that it had no "emotional grip."
John Simon of New York magazine also panned the film and wrote, "Strip Star Wars of its often striking images and its highfalutin scientific jargon, and you get a story, characters, and dialogue of overwhelming banality."
Stanley Kauffmann, reviewing the film in The New Republic, opined that it "was made for those (particularly males) who carry a portable shrine within them of their adolescence, a chalice of a Self that was Better
Then, before the world's affairs or—in any complex way—sex intruded.
"When
Star Wars opened in the UK, stating that Lucas's earlier films were better, Derek Malcolm of The Guardian concluded that it "plays enough games to satisfy the most sophisticated."
The Daily Telegraph's science correspondent Adrian Berry said that Star Wars "is the best such film since 2001 and in certain respects it is one of the most exciting ever made."
He described the plot as "unpretentious and pleasantly devoid of any 'message.'"

A few critics found fault in the lack of representation of African Americans in the space fantasy, with a writer for New Journal and Guide calling it "one of the most racist movies ever produced", pointing out that "the force of evil ... is dressed in all black and has the voice of a black man."
Lucas felt hurt at the accusations.
The film continues to receive critical acclaim from modern critics.
The film review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes indicates a 92% approval rating based on 125 reviews with an overall rating of 8.81/10.
Its consensus states in summary, "A legendarily expansive and ambitious start to the sci-fi saga
, George Lucas opened our eyes to the possibilities of blockbuster filmmaking and things have never been the same."
Metacritic reports a weighted average score of 90 out of 100 based on 24 reviews, indicating "universal acclaim.
"
In his 1997 review of the film's 20th anniversary release, Michael Wilmington of the Chicago Tribune gave the film four out of four stars, saying, "A grandiose and violent epic with a simple and whimsical heart."
A San Francisco Chronicle staff member described the film as "a thrilling experience."

In 2001 Matt Ford of the BBC awarded the film five out of five stars and wrote, "Star Wars isn't the best film ever made, but it is universally loved."
CinemaScore reported that audiences for Star Wars's 1999 re-release gave the film a "A+" grade.
Gene Siskel, writing for the Chicago Tribune in 1999, said, "What places it a sizable cut above the routine is its spectacular visual effects, the best since Stanley Kubrick's 2001."
Andrew Collins of Empire magazine awarded the film five out of five and said, "Star Wars' timeless appeal lies in its easily identified, universal archetypes—goodies to root for, baddies to boo, a princess to be rescued and so on—and if it is most obviously dated to the 70s by the special effects, so be it."
In his 2009 review, Robert Hatch of The Nation called the film "an outrageously successful, what will be called a 'classic,' compilation of nonsense, largely derived but thoroughly reconditioned.
I doubt that anyone will ever match it, though the imitations must already be on the drawing boards.
"
In a more critical review, Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader stated, "None of these characters has any depth, and they're all treated like the fanciful props and settings."
Peter Keough of the Boston Phoenix said, "Star Wars is a junkyard of cinematic gimcracks not unlike the Jawas' heap of purloined, discarded, barely functioning droids."
===
Accolades ===
The film garnered numerous accolades after its release.
Star Wars won six competitive Academy Awards at the 50th Academy Awards: Best Art Direction, Best Costume Design, Best Film Editing, Best Original Score, Best Sound and Best Visual Effects.
A Special Achievement for Sound Effects Editing went to sound designer Ben Burtt and a Scientific and Engineering Award went to John Dykstra for the development of the Dykstraflex Camera (shared with Alvah J. Miller and Jerry Jeffress, who were both granted for the engineering of the Electronic Motion Control System).
Additional nominations included Alec Guinness for Best Actor in a Supporting Role, which went to Jason Robards for Julia and George Lucas for Best Original Screenplay, Best Director, and Best Picture, which were instead awarded to Woody Allen's Annie Hall.
At the 35th Golden Globe Awards, the film was nominated for Best Motion Picture – Drama, Best Director, Best Supporting Actor (Alec Guinness), and it won the award for Best Score.
It received six British Academy Film Awards nominations: Best Film, Best Editing, Best Costume Design, Best Production/Art Design, Best Sound, and Best Score; the film won in the latter two categories.
John Williams's soundtrack album won the Grammy Award for Best Album of Original Score for a Motion Picture or Television Program, and the film attained the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation.
The film also received twelve nominations at the Saturn Awards, winning nine:
Best Science Fiction Film, Best Direction and Best Writing for George Lucas, Best Supporting Actor for Alec Guinness, Best Music for John Williams, Best Costume for John Mollo, Best Make-up for Rick Baker and Stuart Freeborn, Best Special Effects for John Dykstra and John Stears, and Outstanding Editing for Paul Hirsch, Marcia Lucas and Richard Chew.

Legacy ==
Star Wars launched the careers of many of the film's actors: Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker), Harrison Ford (Han Solo), Carrie Fisher (Princess Leia), Peter Mayhew (Chewbacca), Anthony Daniels (C-3PO), and James Earl Jones (voice of Darth Vader).
Ford, who subsequently starred in the Indiana Jones series (1981–present), Blade Runner (1982), and Witness (1985) after working on the film, told the Daily Mirror that Star Wars "boosted my career", and said, "I think the great luck of my career is that I've made these family movies which are introduced to succeeding generations of kids by their families at the time it seems appropriate.
"The
film has spawned a series of films consisting of three trilogies (including the original film), anthology films and an extensive media franchise called the Star Wars expanded universe including books, television series, computer and video games, and comic books.
The original Star Wars trilogy is considered one of the best film trilogies in history.
All of the main films have been box office successes, with the overall box office revenue generated by the Star Wars films (including the animated The Clone Wars) totaling over $10.1 billion, making it the second highest-grossing film series as of 2019.The film also spawned the Star Wars Holiday Special, which debuted on CBS on November 17, 1978 and is often considered a failure; Lucas himself disowned it.
The special has never been aired after its original broadcast, and it has never been officially released on home video.
However, many bootleg copies exist, and the special has consequently become something of an underground legend.
A radio drama adaptation of the film was broadcast on the American National Public Radio network in 1981.
The adaptation was written by Brian Daley and directed by John Madden, and was produced with cooperation from George Lucas, who donated the rights to NPR.
John Williams's music and Ben Burtt's sound design were retained for the show, and Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker) and Anthony Daniels (C-3PO) reprised their roles.
The radio drama narrative began with a version of the backstory to the film which relates Princess Leia's acquisition of the secret Death Star plans.
It also featured scenes not seen in the final cut of the film, such as Luke Skywalker's observation of the space battle above Tatooine through binoculars, a skyhopper race, and Darth Vader's interrogation of Princess Leia.
The radio version was originally considered to be part of the official Star Wars canon, but has since been supplanted by revised canonical narratives.

===
In popular culture ===
Star Wars and its ensuing film installments have been explicitly referenced and satirized across a wide range of media.
Hardware Wars, released in 1978, was one of the first fan films to parody Star Wars.
It received positive critical reaction, went to earn over $1 million, and is one of Lucas's favorite Star Wars spoofs.
Writing for The New York Times, Frank DeCaro said, "Star Wars littered pop culture of the late 1970s with a galaxy of space junk."
He cited Quark (a short-lived 1977 sitcom that parodies the science fiction genre) and Donny & Marie (a 1970s variety show that produced a 10-minute musical adaptation of Star Wars guest starring Daniels and Mayhew) as "television's two most infamous examples."
Mel Brooks's Spaceballs, a satirical comic science fiction parody, was released in 1987 to mixed reviews.
Lucas permitted Brooks to make a spoof of the film under "one incredibly big restriction: no action figures.
"Contemporary animated comedy TV series Family Guy, Robot Chicken, and
The Simpsons have produced episodes satirizing the film series.
Star Wars, together with Lucas, is the subject of the 2010 documentary film
The People vs. George Lucas that details the issues of filmmaking and fanaticism pertaining to the film franchise and its creator.
Many elements of the film have also endured presence in popular culture.
The iconic weapon of choice of the Jedi, the lightsaber, was voted as the most popular weapon in film history in a survey of approximately 2,000 film fans.
Characters such as Darth Vader, Han Solo, and Yoda have become iconic, and all three were named in the top twenty of the British Film Institute's "Best Sci-Fi Characters of All-Time" list.
The expressions "Evil empire" and "May the Force be with you" have become part of the popular lexicon.
A pun on the latter phrase has led to May 4 being regarded by many fans of the franchise as an unofficial Star Wars Day.
To commemorate the film's 30th anniversary in May 2007, the United States Postal Service issued a set of 15 stamps depicting the characters of the franchise.
Approximately 400 mailboxes across the country were also designed to look like R2-D2.
===
Cinematic influence ===
Film critic Roger Ebert wrote in his book The Great Movies, "Like The Birth of a Nation and Citizen Kane, Star Wars was a technical watershed that influenced many of the movies that came after.
"
It began a new generation of special effects and high-energy motion pictures.
The film was one of the first films to link genres together to invent a new, high-concept genre for filmmakers to build upon.
Finally, along with Steven Spielberg's Jaws, it shifted the film industry's focus away from personal filmmaking of the 1970s and towards fast-paced, big-budget blockbusters for younger audiences.
Filmmakers who have said to have been influenced by Star Wars include James Cameron, J.J. Abrams, Damon Lindelof, Dean Devlin, Gareth Edwards, Roland Emmerich, John Lasseter, David Fincher, Peter Jackson, Joss Whedon, Christopher Nolan, Ridley Scott, John Singleton, and Kevin Smith.
Scott, Cameron, and Jackson were influenced by Lucas's concept of the "used future" (where vehicles and culture are obviously dated) and extended the concept for their films, such as Scott's science fiction films Alien (1979) and Blade Runner (1982), Cameron's acclaimed sequel Aliens (1986) and his earlier breakthrough film
The Terminator (1984).
Jackson used the concept for his production of The Lord of the Rings trilogy to add a sense of realism and believability.
Christopher Nolan cited Star Wars as an influence when making the 2010 blockbuster film, Inception.
Some critics have blamed Star Wars, as well as Jaws, for ruining Hollywood by shifting its focus from "sophisticated" films such as The Godfather, Taxi Driver, and Annie Hall to films about spectacle and juvenile fantasy.
On a late 1977 episode of Sneak Previews, Gene Siskel expressed concern that, "It's so successful and so mindless fun
that I hope Hollywood doesn't forget that there are people who like to see serious pictures too.
"
Another critic, Peter Biskind, later complained, "When all was said and done, Lucas and Spielberg returned the 1970s audience, grown sophisticated on a diet of European and New Hollywood films, to the simplicities of the pre-1960s Golden Age of movies...
They marched backward through the looking-glass.
"
In an opposing view, Tom Shone wrote that through Star Wars and Jaws, Lucas and Spielberg "didn't betray cinema at all: they plugged it back into the grid, returning the medium to its roots as a carnival sideshow, a magic act, one big special effect", which was "a kind of rebirth."
===
Recognition ===
In its May 30, 1977 issue, the film's year of release, Time magazine named Star Wars the "Movie of the Year.
"
The publication said it was a "big early supporter" of the vision which would become Star Wars.
In an article intended for the cover of the issue, Time's Gerald Clarke wrote that Star Wars is "a grand and glorious film that may well be the smash hit of 1977, and certainly is the best movie of the year so far.
The result is a remarkable confection: a subliminal history of the movies, wrapped in a riveting tale of suspense and adventure, ornamented with some of the most ingenious special effects ever contrived for film.
"
Each of the subsequent films of the Star Wars saga has appeared on the magazine's cover.

Star Wars was voted the second most popular film by Americans in a 2008 nationwide poll conducted by the market research firm, Harris Interactive.
Star Wars has also been featured in several high-profile audience polls: in 1997, it ranked as the 10th Greatest American Film on the Los Angeles Daily News Readers' Poll; in 2002, the film and its sequel
The Empire Strikes Back were voted as the greatest films ever made in Channel 4's 100 Greatest Films poll; in 2011, it ranked as Best Sci-Fi Film on Best in Film:
The Greatest Movies of Our Time, a primetime special aired by ABC that counted down the best films as chosen by fans, based on results of a poll conducted by ABC and People magazine; in 2014 the film placed 11th in a poll undertaken by The Hollywood Reporter, which balloted every studio, agency, publicity firm, and production house in the Hollywood region.
Reputable publications also have included Star Wars in their best films lists: in 2008, Empire magazine ranked Star Wars at No.
22 on its list of the "500 Greatest Movies of All Time"; in 2010, the film ranked among the "All-Time 100" list of the greatest films as chosen by Time magazine film critic Richard Schickel; the film was also placed on a similar list created by The New York Times, "The New York Times Guide to the Best 1,000 Movies
Ever Made"; in 2012, the film was included in Sight & Sound's prestigious decennial critics poll "Critics' Top 250 Films", ranking at 171st on the list, and in their directors poll at 224th.
Lucas's original screenplay was selected by the Writers Guild of America as the 68th greatest of all time.
In 1989, the United States Library of Congress named Star Wars among its first selections to the National Film Registry as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"; at the time, it was the most recent film to be selected and it was the only film from the 1970s to be chosen.
Although Lucas declined to provide the Library with a workable copy of the original film upon request (instead offering the Special Edition), a viewable scan was made of the original copyright deposit print.
The soundtrack was added to the United States National Recording Registry 15 years later (in 2004).
The lack of a commercially available version of the 1977 original theatrical edit of the film since early '80s VHS releases has spawned numerous restorations by disgruntled fans over the years, such as Harmy's Despecialized Edition.
In addition to the film's multiple awards and nominations, Star Wars has also been recognized by the American Film Institute on several of its lists.
The film ranks first on 100 Years of Film Scores, second on Top 10 Sci-Fi Films, 15th on 100 Years...

Merchandising ==
Little Star Wars merchandise was available for several months after the film's debut, as only Kenner Products had accepted marketing director Charles Lippincott's licensing offers.
Kenner responded to the sudden demand for toys by selling boxed vouchers in its "empty box" Christmas campaign.
Television commercials told children and parents that vouchers within a "Star Wars Early Bird Certificate Package" could be redeemed for four action figures between February and June 1978.
Jay West of the Los Angeles Times said that the boxes in the campaign "became the most coveted empty box[es] in the history of retail.
"
In 2012, the Star Wars action figures were inducted into the National Toy Hall of Fame.
The novelization of the film was published as Star Wars: From the Adventures of Luke Skywalker in December 1976, six months before the film was released.
The credited author was George Lucas, but the book was revealed to have been ghostwritten by Alan Dean Foster.
Marketing director Charles Lippincott secured the deal with Del Rey Books to publish the novelization in November 1976.
By February 1977, a half million copies had been sold.
Foster also wrote the sequel novel Splinter of the Mind's Eye (1978) to be adapted as a low-budget film if Star Wars was not a financial success.
Marvel Comics also adapted the film as the first six issues of its licensed Star Wars comic book, with the first issue sold in April 1977.
Roy Thomas was the writer and Howard Chaykin
was the artist of the adaptation.
Like the novelization, it contained certain elements, such as the scene with Luke and Biggs, that appeared in the screenplay but not in the finished film.
The series was so successful that, according to Jim Shooter, it "single-handedly saved Marvel.
"
In 2013, Dark Horse Comics published a comic adaption of the original screenplay's plot.
Lucasfilm adapted the story for a children's book-and-record set.
Released in 1979, the 24-page Star Wars read-along book was accompanied by a 33⅓ rpm 7-inch phonograph record.
Each page of the book contained a cropped frame from the movie with an abridged and condensed version of the story.
The record was produced by Buena Vista Records, and its content was copyrighted by Black Falcon, Ltd., a subsidiary of Lucasfilm "formed to handle the merchandising for Star Wars."
The Story of Star Wars was a 1977 record album presenting an abridged version of the events depicted in Star Wars, using dialogue and sound effects from the original film.
The recording was produced by George Lucas and Alan Livingston, and was narrated by Roscoe Lee Browne.
The script was adapted by E. Jack Kaplan and Cheryl Gard.
An audio CD boxed set of the Star Wars radio series was released in 1993, containing the original 1981 radio drama along with the radio adaptations of the sequels
, The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi.

Star Wars:
Episode IV
A New Hope on Wookieepedia, a Star Wars wiki
The Star Wars franchise has spawned multiple live-action and animated films.
The franchise started with a film trilogy set in medias res—beginning in the middle of the story—which was later expanded to a trilogy of trilogies, better known as the "Skywalker saga".
The original trilogy was released between 1977 and 1983, the prequel trilogy between 1999 and 2005, and a sequel trilogy between 2015 and 2019.
The original eponymous film, later subtitled Episode IV – A New Hope, was followed by the sequels Episode V –
The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Episode VI – Return of the Jedi (1983), forming what is collectively referred to as the original trilogy.

Years later, a prequel trilogy was released, consisting of Episode I – The Phantom Menace (1999), Episode II – Attack of the Clones (2002), and Episode III – Revenge of the Sith (2005).
After Lucasfilm was sold to Disney, a sequel trilogy began with Episode VII – The Force Awakens (2015), continued with Episode VIII –
The Last Jedi (2017), and concluded with Episode IX – The Rise of Skywalker (2019).
In between the sequel films, two anthology films were released, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (2016) and Solo:
A Star Wars Story (2018), both set between the prequel and original trilogies.
The combined box office revenue of the films equates to over US$10 billion, and it is currently the second-highest-grossing film franchise.
All the major theatrical live-action films were nominated for Academy Awards.
The original film was nominated for most of the major categories, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Supporting Actor for Alec Guinness, while all sequels have been nominated for technical categories.

The first spin-off film produced was the Star Wars Holiday Special (1978).
In 1984 and 1985, two live-action films featuring the Ewoks were televised in the United States and released theatrically in Europe.
Several Star Wars television series have also been released.

==
Skywalker saga ==
The main Star Wars film series is a trilogy of trilogies; as it neared completion, it began to be referred to as the "Skywalker saga".
It was released beginning with the original trilogy (Episodes IV, V and VI, 1977–1983), followed by the prequel trilogy (Episodes I, II and III, 1999–2005) and the sequel trilogy (Episodes VII, VIII and IX, 2015–2019).
The first film released, Star Wars (1977), is the fourth film chronologically and was later subtitled Episode IV – A New Hope.
The saga begins with Star Wars:
Episode
I – The Phantom Menace (1999) and concludes with Episode IX – The Rise of Skywalker (2019).

The story follows each generation of the Force-sensitive Skywalker family and their struggle against the evil Sith lord Palpatine (Darth Sidious).
The prequel trilogy focuses on Anakin Skywalker, his training as a Jedi, and eventual fall to the dark side as Darth Vader.
The original trilogy follows his children, Luke and Leia, as they join the Rebel Alliance and battle Vader, Palpatine and his Galactic Empire.
The sequel trilogy features Ben Solo a.k.a Kylo Ren—the son of Leia and Han Solo, nephew of Luke, and grandson of Anakin—who seeks to rule the galaxy with Rey, the granddaughter of Palpatine and the last Jedi apprentice of Luke and Leia.

Each episodic film begins with an opening crawl, accompanied by the main Star Wars theme by John Williams, who composes the scores for each film.
The first six films—most notably the original trilogy—have had retroactive changes made after their initial theatrical releases.

==
Standalone films ==
As Lucas was outlining a trilogy of trilogies, he also imagined making additional movies unrelated to the Skywalker saga.
The first theatrical films set outside the main episodic series were the Ewok spin-off films Caravan of Courage: An Ewok Adventure (1984) and Ewoks:
The Battle for Endor (1985), the first of which was screened internationally after being produced for television.
After the conclusion of his then six-episode saga in 2005, Lucas returned to spin-offs in the form of television series.

An animated film, The Clone Wars (2008), was released as a pilot to a TV series of the same name.
An anthology series set between the main episodes entered development in parallel to the production of the sequel trilogy, described by Disney CFO Jay Rasulo as origin stories.
The first entry, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (2016), tells the story of the rebels who steal the Death Star plans directly before Episode IV.
Solo:
A Star Wars Story (2018) focuses on Han's backstory, also featuring Chewbacca and Lando Calrissian.

===
Animated film ===


====
The Clone Wars (2008) ====
Preceding the airing of the animated TV series in late 2008, the theatrical feature Star Wars: The Clone Wars was compiled from episodes "almost [as] an afterthought.
"
It reveals that Anakin trained an apprentice between Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith; the series explains Padawan Ahsoka Tano's absence from the latter film.
The character was originally criticized by fans, but by the end of the series the character had become a fan favorite.
The film and series exist in the same level of canon as the episodic and anthology films.

===
Anthology films ===
|}Before selling Lucasfilm to Disney in 2012, and parallel to his development of a sequel trilogy, George Lucas and original trilogy co-screenwriter Lawrence Kasdan started development on a standalone film about a young Han Solo.
In February 2013, Disney CEO Bob Iger made public the development of a Kasdan film and Entertainment Weekly reported that it would focus on Han Solo.
Disney CFO Jay Rasulo has described the standalone films as origin stories.
Kathleen Kennedy confirmed that there was "no attempt being made to carry characters (from the standalone films) in and out of the saga episodes.
"
The standalone films released so far are subtitled "A Star Wars Story".
====
Rogue One:
A Star Wars Story (2016) ====
Rogue One is set directly before Episode IV: A New Hope and focuses on the eponymous group of rebels who obtain the plans to the Death Star.
Its laser was developed by scientist Galen Erso (played by Mads Mikkelsen) after the Empire forcibly abducted him, separating him from his daughter Jyn.
Galen secretly sends a defecting Imperial pilot, Bodhi Rook, to deliver a message warning of the weapon's existence and revealing its weakness to his rebel friend Saw Gerrera.
Under the false promise of her father's liberation, Jyn agrees to help Rebel Alliance intelligence officer Cassian Andor and his droid K-2SO retrieve the message from Saw, now the paranoid leader of an extremist cell of rebels.

The idea for the movie came from John Knoll, the chief creative officer of Industrial Light & Magic.
In May 2014, Lucasfilm announced Gareth Edwards as the director of an anthology film, with Gary Whitta writing the first draft for a release on December 16, 2016.
The film's title was revealed to be Rogue One, with Chris Weitz rewriting the script, and Felicity Jones in the starring role.
Ben Mendelsohn and Diego Luna also play new characters, with James Earl Jones returning to voice Darth Vader.
Edwards stated, "It comes down to a group of individuals who don't have magical powers that have to somehow bring hope to the galaxy."
The film was the first to feature characters introduced in animated Star Wars TV series, namely The Clone Wars' Saw Gerrera, portrayed by Forest Whitaker in the film.
The movie received generally positive reviews, with its performances, action sequences, soundtrack, visual effects and darker tone being praised.
The film grossed over US$500 million worldwide within a week of its release.

====
Solo:
A Star Wars Story (2018) ====
Solo, the second anthology film, focuses on Han Solo about 10 years before A New Hope.
After an escape attempt from his Imperial-occupied home planet of Corellia goes wrong, a young Han vows to return to rescue his girlfriend Qi'ra.
Han "Solo" joins the Imperial Academy; however, he is expelled for his reckless behavior.
Han and his newfound Wookiee friend Chewbacca resort to a criminal life, mentored by veteran smuggler Beckett.
After angering gangster Dryden Vos, Han and his company's lives depend on pulling a heist for him.
Without a ship to travel, they hire Lando Calrissian, the captain and owner of the Millennium Falcon.

Before selling Lucasfilm to Disney, George Lucas had hired Star Wars original trilogy veteran Lawrence Kasdan to write a film about a young Han Solo.
The film stars Alden Ehrenreich as a young Han Solo, Joonas Suotamo as Chewbacca (after serving as a double for the character in The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi), Donald Glover as Lando Calrissian, Emilia Clarke as Qi'ra, and Woody Harrelson as Beckett.
Lucasfilm originally hired Phil Lord and Christopher Miller to direct, but they were fired during principal photography, and replaced by Ron Howard.
A twist ending acknowledges one of the major story arcs of The Clone Wars and Rebels animated series, while leaving the story open ended for sequels.
====
Rogue Squadron (2023) ====
During Disney Investor Day 2020, it was announced that Patty Jenkins would direct a film titled Rogue Squadron, set to be released on December 22, 2023.
The film will be the first film in the franchise directed by a woman, and according to StarWars.com, "will introduce a new generation of starfighter pilots as they earn their wings and risk their lives in a boundary-pushing, high-speed thrill-ride, and move the saga into the future era of the galaxy."
According to Jenkins, the film will be "something original with great influence from the games and the books.
There's a lot of things being acknowledged and understood about the greatness of all of those things, but yes, it's an original story
and I'm so psyched to do it.
"
When asked who was writing the Script for Rogue Squadron, Patty Jenkins said, "I want him to have his own proper announcement, so I'm going to wait until that comes out."
==
Unspecified future films ==
Rian Johnson, the writer/director of The Last Jedi, is confirmed to write and direct the first film of a new trilogy he was outlining as of early 2019.
Though the project is still active as of February 2021, no release date has been set due to Johnson's involvement with other projects.
The trilogy will differ from the Skywalker-focused films in favor of focusing on new characters and possibly a different era than the main film franchise.
In mid-2018, Lucasfilm confirmed that multiple anthology films were in development, with their release following a hiatus after 2019's The Rise of Skywalker.
In addition to Rogue Squadron (2023), two untitled films are scheduled for mid-December 2025, and 2027.On September 25, 2019, it was announced that Marvel Cinematic Universe producer Kevin Feige was developing a Star Wars film with Kathleen Kennedy, with Michael Waldron set to write the screenplay.
On February 21, 2020, Variety reported that a Star Wars film from Sleight director J. D. Dillard and Luke Cage writer Matt Owens was in the early stages of development.
On May 4, it was officially announced that Taika Waititi (who directed the first-season finale of The Mandalorian) will direct a Star Wars film from a screenplay he is co-writing with Krysty Wilson-Cairns.

== Produced for television ==
The first spin-off film (also the first sequel to be released) was a holiday TV special aired in 1978.
Two live-action TV films created in the mid-1980s feature the Ewoks.

===
Star Wars Holiday Special (1978) ===
Produced for CBS in 1978, the Star Wars Holiday Special was a two-hour television special, in the format of a variety show.
Stars of the original film and archive footage from the original Star Wars film appeared alongside celebrity guest stars in plot-related skits, musical numbers, and an animated segment, all loosely tied together by the premise of Chewbacca's family waiting for his arrival for the "Life Day" celebration on his home planet, Kashyyyk.
The special was aired only once and had a widely negative reception.
The 11-minute animated sequence, which features the debut of bounty hunter Boba Fett, was positively received.
===
Ewok films ===
The Ewoks from Return of the Jedi were featured in two spin-off television films, The Ewok Adventure and Ewoks:
The Battle for Endor.
Both aired on ABC on the Thanksgiving weekends of 1984 and 1985, respectively, with at least the first also being given a limited international theatrical release.
Warwick Davis reprised his debut role as the main Ewok, Wicket, in both.
They are set between the events of The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi.
Both films were released on VHS, Laser Disc, and on a double-feature DVD.
Although based on story ideas from Lucas, they do not bear Star Wars in their titles, and were considered to exist in a lower level of canon than the episodic films.
Following Disney's acquisition of the franchise, they were excluded from the canon.
The Battle for Endor would be the last live-action Star Wars television project produced by Lucasfilm until 2019's The Mandalorian.

====
The Ewok Adventure (1984) ====
In a story by Lucas and a screenplay by Bob Carrau, the Towani family spaceship shipwrecks on the forest moon of Endor.
While trying to repair their ship, the castaway family is split, when a giant creature known as the Gorax kidnaps the parents.
Taking pity on the kids, a group of native Ewoks led by Wicket decides to help little Cindel Towani and her older brother Mace, rescue their parents.
Among other stylistic choices making the film unique from the Star Wars episodes is the inclusion of a narrator.

====
Ewoks:
The Battle for Endor (1985) ====
The sequel focuses on the Ewoks protecting their village from marauders led by the evil Lord Terak, who killed all the members of the Towani family except for Cindel, in search of a power battery.

==
Unproduced and rumored films ==
In early 2013, Bob Iger announced the development of a spin-off film written by Simon Kinberg, reported by Entertainment Weekly to focus on bounty hunter Boba Fett during the original trilogy.
In mid-2014, Josh Trank was officially announced as the director of an undisclosed spin-off film, but had left the project a year later due to creative differences, causing a teaser for the film to be scrapped from Star Wars Celebration.
In May 2018, it was reported that James Mangold had signed on to write and direct a Fett film, with Kinberg attached as producer and co-writer.
By October, the Fett film was reportedly no longer in production, with the studio instead focusing on The Mandalorian, which utilizes a similar character design.
In August 2017, it was rumored that films focused on Jabba the Hutt, and Jedi Masters Obi-Wan and Yoda were being considered or were in development.
Stephen Daldry was reportedly in early negotiations to co-write and direct the Obi-Wan movie.
At D23 Expo in August 2019, it was announced that a streaming series about the character would be produced instead.
Felicity Jones, who played Jyn Erso in Rogue One, has the option of another Star Wars film in her contract; notwithstanding her character's fate in Rogue One, it has been speculated that she could return in other anthology films.
In 2018, critics noted that Solo was intentionally left open for sequels.
Alden Ehrenreich and Emilia Clarke confirmed that their contracts to play Han Solo and Q'ira extended for additional films, if required.
An unannounced film centered around the Mos Eisley Spaceport was reportedly put on hold or cancelled in mid-2018, leading to rumors of the cancellation or postponement of the anthology series.
Lucasfilm swiftly denied the rumors as "inaccurate", confirming that multiple unannounced films were in development.
Game of Thrones creators David Benioff and D. B. Weiss were to write and produce a trilogy of Star Wars films scheduled to be released in December 2022, 2024, and 2026, which were first announced to be in development in February 2018.
However, citing their commitment to a Netflix deal, the duo stepped away from the project in October 2019.
Kennedy stated her openness to their returning when their schedules allow.
Additionally, though unconfirmed by Lucasfilm, BuzzFeed reported in May 2019 that Laeta Kalogridis was writing the script for the first film in a potential Knights of the Old Republic trilogy.
In January 2020, a film set in the era of The High Republic was rumored to be in development.

Star Wars Rebels is an American 3D animated science fiction television series produced by Lucasfilm Animation and set in the Star Wars galaxy five years before A New Hope.
It takes place during the Dark Times, when the Galactic Empire is hunting down the last of the Jedi while a fledgling rebellion against the Empire is emerging.
The visual style of the series is inspired by the original Star Wars trilogy concept art by Ralph McQuarrie.
The series features new characters, along with some from the original trilogy and from the previous animated series, The Clone Wars.

The series premiered as a one-hour television film, Spark of Rebellion, on October 3, 2014, on Disney Channel prior to the premiere of the series on October 13 on Disney XD.
The second season premiered on June 20, 2015, with a one-hour television film, The Siege of Lothal.
The third season premiered on September 24, 2016, with the television film, Steps Into Shadow.
The fourth and final season premiered on October 16, 2017, with another one-hour television film, Heroes of Mandalore.
Its final episode aired on March 5, 2018.Dave Filoni, Simon Kinberg and Greg Weisman served as executive producers of season one.
Weisman left the show after season one.
Filoni was also the supervising director for the first two seasons, a role he relinquished after accepting a promotion that expanded his creative role into overseeing all Lucasfilm Animation projects; he chose Justin Ridge to succeed him for season three.
Filoni assumed the role back for the fourth season.

The series has been generally well-received with several award wins and nominations.
Rebels garnered praise for its writing, characters, voice acting, score, and expansion of the franchise's mythology, although it received some criticism for its animation and perceived lack of depth.
The show was nominated for the Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Animated Series and the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Children's Program.
Rebels became the first recipient of the Saturn Award for Best Animated Series on Television, winning for its final two seasons.

A number of tie-in media have been released to expand upon the series' lore such as the comic book series Kanan, the novel A New Dawn, and the novel series Thrawn.

Historical influences ===
Characters in Star Wars Rebels have taken influence from Biblical, Hebrew, and Greco-Roman mythological names.
Star Wars writers have often used biblical names for Jedi while giving galactic Imperial characters Roman names.
In 2015 an interview was conducted with Dave Filoni and Simon Kinberg where Kinsberg stated that they wanted to connect to the original films by using the biblical naming scheme seen in the films.

Both Caleb and Ezra are historically Hebrew names with Ezra translating to "Helper".
Characters with Roman names include Clone Captain Rex which translates to "King" in Latin along with Sabine Wren, Admiral Brom Titus and Admiral Kassius Konstantine.

Star Wars:
The Rise of Skywalker (also known as Star Wars: Episode IX –
The Rise of Skywalker) is a 2019 American epic space opera film produced, co-written, and directed by J. J. Abrams.
Produced by Lucasfilm and Abrams' production company Bad Robot Productions, and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is the third installment of the Star Wars sequel trilogy, following The Force Awakens (2015) and The Last Jedi (2017), and the final episode of the nine-part "Skywalker saga".
The film's ensemble cast includes Carrie Fisher, Mark Hamill, Adam Driver, Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Anthony Daniels, Naomi Ackie, Domhnall Gleeson, Richard E. Grant, Lupita Nyong'o, Keri Russell, Joonas Suotamo, Kelly Marie Tran, Ian McDiarmid, and Billy Dee Williams.
The Rise of Skywalker follows Rey, Finn, and Poe Dameron as they lead the Resistance's final stand against Supreme Leader Kylo Ren and the First Order, who are aided by the return of the deceased Galactic Emperor, Palpatine.

Following initial reports that The Last Jedi director Rian Johnson would write the script for Episode IX, in August 2015, Colin Trevorrow was hired to direct and to write a script with his collaborator Derek Connolly; both ultimately retain story credit with Abrams and Chris Terrio.
In September 2017, Trevorrow left the project following creative differences with producer Kathleen Kennedy, and Abrams returned as director.
John Williams, composer for the previous episodic films, returned to compose the score for the last time for the franchise.
Principal photography began in August 2018 at Pinewood Studios in England and wrapped in February 2019, with post-production completed in November 2019.
With an estimated budget of $275 million, it is one of the most expensive films ever made.

The film premiered in Los Angeles on December 16, 2019, and was released in the United States on December 20.
It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the acting, action sequences, musical score, and visual effects, but criticized the story, pacing, and its perceived departures from the plot and themes of The Last Jedi.
The film grossed over $1.074 billion worldwide, becoming the seventh-highest-grossing film of 2019; although the film was the lowest-grossing installment of the trilogy, it turned an estimated net profit of $300 million.
The film received three nominations at the 92nd Academy Awards (Best Original Score, Best Visual Effects, and Best Sound Editing) as well as three at the 73rd British Academy Film Awards (also Best Special Visual Effects, Best Original Music, and Best Sound).

Plot ==
Following a threat of revenge by the revived Emperor Palpatine, Kylo Ren obtains a Sith Wayfinder, leading him to the uncharted planet Exegol.
There, he finds Palpatine, who reveals that he created Snoke as a puppet to control the First Order and lure Kylo to the dark side.
Palpatine unveils the Final Order—a secret armada of Star Destroyers—and tells Kylo to find and kill Rey, who is continuing her Jedi training under Resistance leader Leia Organa.
Finn and Poe Dameron deliver intelligence from a spy that Palpatine is on Exegol; Rey has learned from Luke Skywalker's notes that a Sith Wayfinder can lead them there.
Rey, Finn, Poe, Chewbacca, BB-8, and C-3PO depart in the Millennium Falcon to Pasaana, where a clue to a Wayfinder is hidden.

Kylo initiates a Force bond with Rey to discover her location; he travels to Pasaana with his warrior subordinates, the Knights of Ren.
With the help of Lando Calrissian, Rey and her friends find the clue—a dagger inscribed with Sith text, which C-3PO's programming forbids him from interpreting—and the remains of a Jedi hunter named Ochi and his ship.
Rey senses Kylo nearby and faces him.
The First Order captures the Falcon, Chewbacca, and the dagger; attempting to save Chewbacca, Rey accidentally destroys a First Order transport with Force lightning.
Believing Chewbacca to be dead, the group escapes on Ochi's ship.

The group travels to Kijimi, where a droidsmith extracts the Sith text from C-3PO's memory, revealing coordinates to a Wayfinder.
Rey senses Chewbacca is alive, and the group mounts a rescue mission to Kylo's Star Destroyer.
Rey recovers the dagger and has visions of Ochi killing her parents with it.
Kylo informs her that she is Palpatine's granddaughter; the Sith Lord had ordered Ochi to recover Rey as a child, but her parents hid her on Jakku to protect her.
General Hux saves Poe, Finn, and Chewbacca from execution, revealing himself as the spy.
He permits the group to escape on the Falcon but is discovered and killed by Allegiant General Pryde.
The group flies the Falcon to the Wayfinder's coordinates on a moon in the Endor system.

Rey retrieves the Wayfinder from the remains of the second Death Star, but she is met by Kylo, who destroys the Wayfinder and duels her.
In a dying act, Leia calls to Kylo through the Force, distracting him as Rey impales him.
Sensing Leia's death, Rey heals Kylo and takes his ship to exile herself on Ahch-To.
There, Luke's Force spirit encourages Rey to face Palpatine and gives her Leia's lightsaber.
Rey leaves for Exegol in Luke's X-wing fighter, using the Wayfinder from Kylo's ship.
Meanwhile, Kylo converses with a memory of his father, Han Solo; he throws away his lightsaber and reclaims his identity as Ben Solo.
Sensing Leia's death and Ben's redemption
, Palpatine sends one of his superlaser-equipped Star Destroyers to destroy Kijimi as a show of force.

Rey transmits her coordinates to R2-D2, allowing the Resistance—now led by Poe and Finn—to follow her to Exegol.
There, she confronts Palpatine; he demands that she kill him for his spirit to pass into her.
Lando brings reinforcements from across the galaxy to join the battle.
Ben overpowers the Knights of Ren and joins Rey, but Palpatine drains their power to rejuvenate himself.
He incapacitates Ben and attacks the Resistance fleet with Force lightning.
Weakened, Rey hears the voices of past Jedi, who lend her their strength.
Palpatine attacks her with lightning, but Rey deflects it using Luke and Leia's lightsabers, killing Palpatine before dying herself.
Ben uses the Force to revive her at the cost of his own life; Rey kisses Ben before he dies.
The Resistance defeats Palpatine's armada, while people across the galaxy rise up against the First Order.
The Resistance returns to their base to celebrate.

After the celebration, Rey visits Luke's abandoned childhood home on Tatooine and buries his and Leia's lightsabers.
A passerby asks her name; as the spirits of Luke and Leia watch, she replies, "Rey Skywalker."

Production ==


===
Development ===
In October 2012, Star Wars creator George Lucas sold his production company Lucasfilm to The Walt Disney Company.
Disney subsequently announced the Star Wars sequel trilogy.
In June 2014, it was announced that Rian Johnson, writer and director of The Last Jedi, would write a story treatment for Episode IX.
However, Johnson later stated that he was not involved in writing the film.
In August 2015, Colin Trevorrow was announced as the director of the film; he was to write the script with frequent collaborator Derek Connolly.

=== Pre-production ===

In February 2016, Disney chief executive officer Bob Iger confirmed that pre-production on Episode IX had begun.
Carrie Fisher died in December 2016.
Prior to the release of the film, Carrie Fisher's brother Todd Fisher, who planned her character
General Leia Organa to appear in the film before her death, revealed that “she was going to be the big payoff in the final film” and “she was going to be the last Jedi, so to speak.
”In
August 2017, it was announced that Jack Thorne would rewrite the script.
In September 2017, Lucasfilm stated that Trevorrow had left the production following creative differences, resulting his working relationship with Kathleen Kennedy to become unmanageable after failing to deliver a satisfactory script, despite writing several drafts.
That same month, Johnson was rumored as the top choice to replace Trevorrow as director, but stated "it was never in the plan for me to direct Episode IX", and later, J. J. Abrams, the director of The Force Awakens, was announced to return as the director in Episode IX.The story team met with George Lucas before writing the new script to discuss the nature of the Force.
Abrams co-wrote the script with Chris Terrio, though Trevorrow and Connolly retain story credits.
The story was rewritten to some extent before filming was completed.
The film was produced by Abrams' company Bad Robot Productions, Kathleen Kennedy, and Michelle Rejwan.
According to Terrio, the film's script had to include certain narrative beats provided by Kennedy and Rejwan, including the redemption of the character Kylo Ren.
Before filming, Episode IX was initially given the working title Black Diamond, which was then changed to TrIXie in 2018, so that the roman numeral "IX" would be included in the working title.
The film's title, The Rise of Skywalker, was announced at April 2019's the Star Wars Celebration in Chicago.

===
Casting ===
Carrie Fisher, who played Leia Organa, died on December 27, 2016.
Variety and Reuters reported that she had been planned for a key role in Episode IX.
In January 2017, Lucasfilm stated that there were no plans to digitally generate Fisher's performance as they had for Rogue One (2016).
The following April, Fisher's brother Todd revealed that Fisher's daughter, Billie Lourd, had granted Disney the rights to use recent footage of Fisher.
However, a week later, Kathleen Kennedy stated that Fisher would not appear in the film.
In July 2018, J. J. Abrams announced that unused footage of Fisher from The Force Awakens would be used to help complete the story.
In flashback scenes, digital de-aging was used for the appearance of Luke and Leia through the use of facial shots of both characters from the Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi respectively.

In July 2018, Keri Russell was in talks to play a part with some "action-heavy fight scenes", and it was confirmed that Billy Dee Williams would return as Lando Calrissian, onscreen for the first time since 1983's Return of the Jedi—marking one of the longest intervals between portrayals of a character by the same actor in American film history.
At the end of July, Russell was confirmed to have been cast, and there was an announcement of returning and additional new cast members.
In late August, Deadline Hollywood announced that Dominic Monaghan and Matt Smith had been cast in unspecified roles, but Smith later denied his involvement.
Greg Grunberg reprises his role as Temmin "Snap" Wexley.
At the Star Wars Celebration in April 2019, it was revealed via the film's teaser trailer that Ian McDiarmid would return to portray Palpatine.
Since the event was held after principal photography wrapped, Abrams was thrilled that news of McDiarmid on the set never leaked.
Kathleen Kennedy said they decided to reveal Palpatine's return ahead of the film's release because of the characters playing a larger role in the story, having them differentiated from Baby Yoda, the character from The Mandalorian.

===
Filming ===
Principal photography began on August 1, 2018, at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire, England.

Filming also took place in Wadi Rum, Jordan.

Oscar Isaac stated that Abrams was allowing more improvised acting than in the previous two films.
Due to the tight schedule, some editing took place on set.
Principal photography wrapped on February 15, 2019.
Footage from the film was shown at The Walt Disney Company's annual shareholders meeting on March 7, 2019.
Two weeks of reshoots took place at Pinewood involving Hamill, Ridley, and Isaac in July 2019.
Another round of reshoots took place at Bad Robot Productions between late September and mid-October.

===
Post-production ===
The visual effects were created by Industrial Light & Magic and supervised by Roger Guyett.
The film finished post-production on November 25, 2019.
After Boyega accidentally left a copy of the script in his hotel room, it was listed on eBay for around £65.
===
Music ===
In January 2018, it was confirmed that John Williams would return to compose and conduct The Rise of Skywalker.
The next month, Williams announced that it would be the last Star Wars film for which he would compose the score.
In August 2019, it was revealed that Williams had written about 35 of an expected 135 minutes of music for the film, which according to Williams' brother Don, would incorporate all of the major themes of the Skywalker saga.
Scoring began in July 2019 with Williams and William Ross conducting and orchestrating the sessions over the course of six months.
The official soundtrack album was released by Walt Disney Records on December 20, 2019.

Critical response ===
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 51% of 507 reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.1/10.
The website's critical consensus reads, "The Rise of Skywalker suffers from a frustrating lack of imagination, but concludes this beloved saga with fan-focused devotion.
"
As of January 2020, the film is the lowest-rated live-action film of the Star Wars series.
According to the review aggregator Metacritic, which sampled 61 reviews and calculated a weighted average of 53 out of 100, The Rise of Skywalker received "mixed or average reviews".
Richard Roeper, reviewing for the Chicago Sun-Times, gave the film three stars out of four, writing that it "rarely comes close to touching greatness, but it's a solid, visually dazzling and warmhearted victory [for] quality filmmaking."
The A.V. Club's A. A. Dowd gave the film a C+, stating that the film "is so freighted with obligation that it almost groans under the weight, flashing a weak smile as it vaguely approximates the appearance of a zippy good time."
Michael Phillips for Chicago Tribune wrote that the film "does the job.
It wraps up the trio of trilogies begun in 1977 in a confident, soothingly predictable way, doing all that is cinematically possible to avoid [upsetting the] tradition-minded quadrants of the Star Wars fan base.
"Mick
LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle described the film as "a disappointment" and wrote, "For all the movie's faults, it's likely that most people will consider The Rise of Skywalker and accept the trade: Sit through a
so-so 110 minutes to get to a strong half hour.
"
Owen Gleiberman of Variety called the film "the most elegant, emotionally rounded, and gratifying Star Wars adventure since the glory days of Star Wars (1977) and The Empire Strikes Back (1980) [...]
but given the last eight films, the bar isn't that high.
"
The BBC's Nicholas Barber praised the film's acting and wrote, "The Rise of Skywalker has been lovingly crafted by a host of talented people, and yet the best they can do is pay tribute to everything he did several decades ago.
"Scott
Mendelson for Forbes described the film as "possibly worse" compared to the previous Skywalker saga films while ending the main saga and "denying this new trilogy its artistic reason for existence", and criticized the film for retconning The Last Jedi and its plot; saying that "patronizing reversals in the name of mollifying the fans who merely want to be reminded of the first three movies."
Justin Chang of the Los Angeles Times described the film as "a Last Jedi corrective", which is "more accurate way to describe it" and is "an epic failure of nerve"; saying that "feels more like a retreat, a return to a zone of emotional and thematic safety from a filmmaker with a gift for packaging nostalgia as subversion.
"
Writing for The New Yorker, Richard Brody states that the film's faults "are those of the franchise over all"; as the film's director "J. J. Abrams is mainly a distiller and a magnifier and brings virtually no originality to it", using the controls of Michael Bay.
Whereas Asian actress Kelly Marie Tran was a main character in The Last Jedi, she appears for about a minute in The Rise of Skywalker.
The reduced role was interpreted by some critics as a concession to fans who disliked her character; Tran had been a target of online harassment following the release of The Last Jedi.
People involved on the previous film defended her, with some claiming some of the attackers were racist, and body shamers.
Critics said she was "sidelined" into a minor character, and commented on how she was written out "without any explanation" and her minor role was considered by one critic to be "one of the film's biggest disappointments".
In regards to the criticism towards her reduced screen-time, screenwriter Chris Terrio said it was due to the difficulty of including the deceased Carrie Fisher archive footage in scenes planned to feature both characters.

===
Audience response ===
According to CinemaScore, American audiences gave the film an average grade of "B+" on an A+ to F scale, the lowest among the live-action films.
On PostTrak, audiences gave the film an average four stars out of five, with 70% saying they would definitely recommend it; parents and children under 12 years old (who made up 16% of opening night attendance) gave it a full five stars out of five.
Men (who made up 67% of the audience) gave the film an overall positive score of 80% while women (32%) gave it an 84%.
RelishMix, which tracks social media posts and online presence, "noticed a divided reaction to Skywalker online, though it leaned slightly positive".
Months prior to the film's trailer release, it was review bombed on Rotten Tomatoes to the point where the "Want to See" percentage went down as far as 5% within a day, with many of the reviews focusing on lingering negativity towards The Last Jedi.
Similar bombing with Captain Marvel (2019) caused Rotten Tomatoes to completely remove the "Want to See"  feature after temporarily changing it to a number.

Underworld ===
In 2005, plans for a live-action television series set between the prequel and original trilogies were announced at Star Wars Celebration.
In 2007, Lucas described the project as "one show that will split into four shows, focusing on different characters.
"
It entered development in early 2009.
The series was described as "gritty and dark" and was expected to feature characters such as Han Solo, Chewbacca, Lando Calrissian, Boba Fett, C-3PO, and Emperor Palpatine.
Lucas described the series as "more talky.
It's more of what I would call a soap opera with a bunch of personal dramas in it.
It's not really based on action-adventure films from the '30s—
it's actually more based on film noir movies from the '40s!"
Producer Rick McCallum revealed the working title, Star Wars: Underworld, in 2012, and that it would focus on criminal and political power struggles in the "period when the Empire is trying to take things over.
"Over one hundred 42-minute episodes were planned, with 50 scripts written.
These were mostly second drafts, but due to their complex content, were too expensive to produce.
Ronald D. Moore was one of the writers, and extensive artwork including character, costume, and set designs were developed at Skywalker Ranch under the close supervision of Lucas and McCallum.
The project was still being considered after Lucasfilm was sold to Disney, including by ABC, with stories being reviewed as of December 2015.
According to Kathleen Kennedy,
That's an area we've spent a lot of time, reading through the material that he developed is something we very much would like to explore. ...
So our attitude is, we don't want to throw any of that stuff away.
It's gold.
And it's something we're spending a lot of time looking at, pouring [sic] through, discussing, and we may very well develop those things further.
We definitely want to.

The plot of the anthology film Rogue One: A Star Wars Story was originally pitched as an episode of the series.
The story of Han winning the Millennium Falcon from Lando was planned to be featured and later developed as Solo:
A Star Wars Story.
In early 2020, Stargate Studios shared test footage made to promote the series to networks, as well as a Google Doc listing production details for the series.

===
Detours ===
Star Wars Detours is an unaired animated parody series from the creators of Robot Chicken, which was postponed in 2013 and ultimately unaired.
Production began in 2012 prior to the Disney acquisition, with 39 episodes completed and 62 additional scripts finished.

===
Cara Dune-centered series ===
By November 2020, a Mandalorian spin-off series centered on the character Cara Dune was being considered for Disney+, which Lucasfilm intended to announce the following month at Disney's Investor Day event.
Deadline Hollywood, however, reported at that time that despite being rumored, the series was not in development.
Any series development was no longer being considered after Gina Carano, the actress who portrayed Cara Dune in The Mandalorian, made controversial social media posts in November 2020.

Star Wars:
The Force Awakens (also known as Star Wars:
Episode VII – The Force Awakens) is a 2015 American epic space opera film produced, co-written, and directed by J. J. Abrams.
Produced by Lucasfilm and Abrams' production company Bad Robot Productions, and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is the first installment in the Star Wars
sequel trilogy, following Return of the Jedi (1983), and the seventh episode of the nine-part "Skywalker saga".
The film's ensemble cast includes Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Adam Driver, Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Lupita Nyong'o, Andy Serkis, Domhnall Gleeson, Anthony Daniels, Peter Mayhew, and Max von Sydow.
Set thirty years after Return of the Jedi, The Force Awakens follows Rey, Finn, Poe Dameron, and Han Solo's search for Luke Skywalker and their fight in the Resistance, led by General Leia Organa and veterans of the Rebel Alliance, against Kylo Ren and the First Order, a successor to the Galactic Empire.

The film was announced after The Walt Disney Company's acquisition of Lucasfilm in October 2012.
The film is the first Star Wars film to not extensively involve franchise creator George Lucas, who only served as a creative consultant in the early stages of production.
The film was produced by Abrams, his longtime collaborator Bryan Burk, and Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy.
Abrams and Lawrence Kasdan, co-writer of the original trilogy films
The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi, rewrote an initial script by Michael Arndt.
John Williams, composer for the previous episodic films, returned to compose the score.
Filming began in April 2014 in Abu Dhabi and Iceland, with principal photography also taking place in Ireland and at Pinewood Studios in England, and wrapped in November.

The Force Awakens premiered in Los Angeles on December 14, 2015, and was released in the United States on December 18.
The film received positive reviews for its screenplay, direction, acting performances (particularly those of Ford, Driver, Ridley, Isaac, and Boyega), musical score, visual effects, editing, and action sequences, although some critics found it too similar to A New Hope (1977).
The film marked an improvement in a reception over the previous four Star Wars films.
The film broke various box office records and became the highest-grossing installment in the franchise, the highest-grossing film in the United States and Canada, the highest-grossing film of 2015, and the third-highest-grossing film at the time of its release, with a worldwide gross of over $2 billion and a net profit of over $780 million.
Among films' box office adjusted for inflation, the film is the top-grossing sequel of all time in North America.
The film received numerous accolades, including five nominations at the 88th Academy Awards and four nominations at the 69th British Academy Film Awards, where it won the award for Best Special Visual Effects.
Two sequels within the sequel trilogy have been released: The Last Jedi (2017) and The Rise of Skywalker (2019).

On the desert planet Jakku, Resistance pilot Poe Dameron receives a map to Luke's place from Lor San Tekka.
Stormtroopers commanded by Kylo Ren raid the village and capture Poe, while Kylo kills San Tekka.
Poe's droid, BB-8, escapes with the map and encounters a scavenger named Rey.
Kylo tortures Poe using the Force and learns of BB-8.
Stormtrooper FN-2187, disillusioned by the First Order, frees Poe, and they escape in a stolen TIE fighter.
Upon learning that FN-2187 has no other name, Poe gives him the name "Finn".
As they head to Jakku to retrieve BB-8, a First Order Star Destroyer shoots them, and they crash-land.
Finn survives and assumes that Poe died in the crash.
He encounters Rey and BB-8, but the First Order tracks them and launches an airstrike.
Rey, Finn, and BB-8 steal the Millennium Falcon and escape the planet.

The Falcon gets discovered and boarded by Han Solo and Chewbacca.
Gangs seeking to settle debts with Han attack, but the group escape in the Falcon.
At the First Order's Starkiller Base, a planet converted into a superweapon, Supreme Leader Snoke allows General Hux to use the weapon for the first time.
Snoke questions
Kylo's ability to deal with emotions on his father, Han Solo, who Kylo states means nothing to him.

Aboard the Falcon, Han determines that BB-8's map is incomplete.
He then explains that Luke attempted to rebuild the Jedi Order but exiled himself when an apprentice turned to the dark side, destroyed the temple, and slaughtered the other apprentices.
The crew travels to the planet Takodana and meets with cantina owner Maz Kanata, who offers help getting BB-8 to the Resistance.
The Force draws Rey to a secluded vault, where she finds the lightsaber once belonging to Luke and his father, Anakin Skywalker.
She experiences disturbing visions and flees into the woods, confused and terrified.
Maz gives Finn the lightsaber for safekeeping.

The First Order attacks Takodana in search of BB-8.
Han, Chewbacca, and Finn are saved by Resistance X-wing fighters led by Poe, who survived the crash.
Leia arrives at Takodana with C-3PO and reunites with Han.
Meanwhile, Kylo captures Rey and takes her to Starkiller Base, but she resists his mind-reading attempts.
Snoke orders Kylo to bring Rey to him.
Discovering she can use the Force, Rey escapes using a Jedi mind trick on a guard.

At the Resistance base on D'Qar, BB-8 finds R2-D2, who had been inactive since Luke's disappearance.
As Starkiller Base prepares to fire once more, the Resistance devises a plan to destroy it by attacking its thermal oscillator.
Using the Falcon, Han, Chewbacca, and Finn infiltrate the facility, find Rey, and plant explosives.
Han confronts Kylo, calling him by his birth name Ben, and implores him to abandon the dark side.
Kylo seems to consider this, but ultimately refuses and kills his father.
Devastated, Chewbacca shoots Kylo and sets off the explosives, allowing Poe to attack and destroy the base's thermal oscillator.

The injured Kylo pursues Finn and Rey into the woods.
Finn fights Kylo with the lightsaber to protect Rey before Kylo knocks him unconscious.
Rey takes the lightsaber and channels the Force to defeat Kylo in a duel; they are then separated by a fissure as the planet's surface begins to splinter.
Snoke orders Hux to evacuate and bring Kylo to him to complete his training.
Chewbacca rescues Rey and the unconscious Finn, and they escape aboard the Falcon.
As the Resistance forces flee, Starkiller Base implodes.
R2-D2 awakens and reveals the rest of the map, which Rey uses to find the oceanic planet
Ahch-To in the Falcon.

On Ahch-To, Rey finds Luke atop a cliff on a remote island.
Without a word, she presents him with his father's lightsaber.

== Cast ==
Harrison Ford as Han Solo: A rogue and a smuggler, formerly a key player in the Rebel Alliance.
Ford said, "[Han] does not aspire to the position of Obi-Wan, nor do I aspire to be some New Age Alec Guinness.
His development is consistent with the character, and there are emotional elements which have occasioned his growth.
[...]
There's a lot of the rogue still left in Solo.
Some things don't change."

Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker:
The last Jedi, who has gone into hiding.
Regarding Luke, Han, and Leia, Abrams stated: "They'd be as old and as mythic as the tale of King Arthur.
They would be characters who [the new characters] may have heard of, but maybe not.
They'd be characters who they might believe existed, or just sounded like a fairy tale.
"
Hamill was initially skeptical of Luke only appearing at the end of the film and called his limited screentime "a great surprise".
Abrams added that the film's ending was intended to be "this great long drumroll up to seeing this guy".

Carrie Fisher as General Leia Organa: The former princess of the destroyed planet Alderaan, now General of the Resistance, and Luke's twin sister.
After the events of Return of the Jedi, she is described as "a little more battle weary, a little more broken hearted".
Fisher described Leia as "Solitary.
Under a lot of pressure.
Committed as ever to her cause, but I would imagine feeling somewhat defeated, tired, and pissed."
Abrams said: "The stakes are pretty high in the story for her, so there's not much goofing around where Leia's concerned."

Adam Driver as Kylo Ren: A dark warrior who is strong with the Force, the leader of the Knights of Ren, and a high-ranking member of the First Order.
He is the son of Han and Leia, nephew of Luke, and the grandson of the deceased Darth Vader.
Driver said the team tried "not to think of him as being bad, or evil, or a villain.
Something that was more three-dimensional.
He's more dangerous and unpredictable, and morally justified in doing what he thinks is right."

Daisy Ridley as Rey: A highly Force-sensitive scavenger who was abandoned as a child on the desert planet Jakku and awaits her absent family's return.
Ridley said: "She's completely self-sufficient and does everything for herself, until she meets [Finn] and an adventure begins.
"Cailey
Fleming as young Rey
John Boyega as Finn: A reformed First Order stormtrooper.
Boyega said that he learned he obtained the part "over a nice breakfast in Mayfair" during which Abrams told him, "John, you're the new star of Star Wars."
Boyega said: "When we find Finn, he's in incredible danger.
And the way he reacts to this danger changes his life, and launches him into the Star Wars universe in a very unique way."
He said in another interview: "He's been taught about Luke Skywalker, he knows about his history.
For him it's like joining the army and then learning about one of the great enemies of your country."

Oscar Isaac as Poe Dameron: A Resistance X-wing fighter pilot.
Isaac said: "He's the best freaking pilot in the galaxy, [...]
He's been sent on a mission by a certain princess, and he ends up coming up across [Finn], and their fates are forever intertwined."

Lupita Nyong'o as Maz Kanata: A wise and perceptive figure operating a somewhat shady cantina on the peaceful forest planet Takodana who is acquainted with Han.
Abrams said Kanata has "lived over a thousand years.
She's had this watering hole for about a century, and it's like another bar that you'd find in a corner of the Star Wars universe."
According to Abrams, the character was based on his former high school English teacher, Rose Gilbert, who lectured at the Palisades Charter High School from 1961 to 2013.
Abrams said the team "really wanted the story to feel authentic, despite being a wild fantasy.
I mentioned Rose in an early story meeting as a sort of timeless, wise figure that I'd actually known in my life."

Andy Serkis as Supreme Leader Snoke:
The political leader of the First Order.
He is Kylo Ren's master, who seduced him to the dark side and is very powerful in the dark side of the Force.
Serkis described Snoke as "quite an enigmatic character, and strangely vulnerable at the same time as being quite powerful, [...]
He is large.
He appears tall.
And also just the facial design—you couldn't have gotten there with prosthetics.
[...]
Without giving too much away at this point, he has a very distinctive, idiosyncratic bone and facial structure."

Domhnall Gleeson as General Hux:
The commander of the First Order's Starkiller Base.
Gleeson described him as "pretty ruthless.
A strong disciplinarian would be a mild way of putting it.
[...]
He's kind of opposite Kylo Ren.
They have their own relationship, which is individual and unusual.
One of them is strong in different ways than the other.
They're both vying for power."

Anthony Daniels as C-3PO: A humanoid protocol droid in Organa's service.
Daniels said the actors were allowed to experiment with their performances, and that Abrams "made a field, a playpen where you were allowed to take your time and suggest things".

Max von Sydow as Lor San Tekka: A retired adventurer on Jakku, aiding the Resistance in finding Skywalker.

Development ===
Star Wars creator George Lucas discussed ideas for a sequel trilogy several times after the conclusion of the original trilogy, but denied any intent to make it.
In October 2012, he sold his production company Lucasfilm to The Walt Disney Company.
Speaking alongside Lucasfilm's new president, Kathleen Kennedy, Lucas said: "I always said I wasn't going to do any more
and that's true, because I'm not going to do any more, but that doesn't mean I'm unwilling to turn it over to Kathy to do more.
"As
creative consultant on the film, Lucas attended early story meetings and advised on the details of the Star Wars universe.
Among the materials he turned over to the production team were his rough story treatments for Episodes VII–IX, which Lucas requested be read only by Kennedy, Bob Iger, Alan F. Horn, and Kevin A. Mayer.
Lucas later said Disney had discarded his story ideas and that he had no further involvement with the film.
Lucas' son Jett told The Guardian that his father was "very torn" about having sold the rights to the franchise and that his father was "there to guide" but that "he wants to let it go and become its new generation".

The Force Awakens' first screenplay was written by Michael Arndt.
Early drafts had Luke Skywalker appear midway through the film, but Arndt found that "every time Luke came in and entered the movie, he just took it over.
Suddenly you didn't care about your main character anymore.
"
The writers decided to use Luke as the film's MacGuffin and, as something that the protagonists needed to find, would not appear in person until the final scene.
Arndt also developed some backstory elements for the returning characters from the original trilogy, such as how Leia was instrumental in rebuilding the Republic after the fall of the Empire before being discredited when it was publicly revealed that her biological father was Darth Vader (this would go on to become a central plot point in the canonical novel Star Wars:
Bloodline).Several directors were considered, including David Fincher, Brad Bird, Jon Favreau, and Guillermo del Toro; after a suggestion by Steven Spielberg to Kennedy, J. J. Abrams was named director in January 2013, with Lawrence Kasdan and Simon Kinberg as project consultants.
Arndt worked on the script for eight months, but said he needed 18 more, which was more time than Disney or Abrams could give him.
The production announced Arndt's exit from the project on October 24, 2013, and Kasdan and Abrams took over script duties.
Abrams expressed relief that the release date was announced for December 2015 instead of a previously discussed summer release.
He and Kasdan planned the story while walking in Santa Monica, New York City, Paris, and London.
The first draft was completed in six weeks.
Abrams said the key to the film was [returned] to the roots of the first Star Wars films and be based more on emotion than explanation.
In January 2014, Abrams confirmed that the script was complete.
In April 2014, Lucasfilm clarified that Episodes VII–IX would not feature storylines from the Star Wars expanded universe, though other elements could be included, as with the TV series Star Wars Rebels.
Abrams stated that he purposely withheld some plot elements from The Force Awakens, such as Rey and Finn's last names and backgrounds.
Kennedy admitted that "we haven't mapped out every single detail [of the sequel trilogy] yet", but said that Abrams was collaborating with The Last Jedi director Rian Johnson, and that Johnson would work with The Rise of Skywalker's then-director Colin Trevorrow to ensure a smooth transition and that "everybody's got a say in how we move forward with this".
Daisy Ridley later recounted that J. J. Abrams had written drafts for episodes 8 and 9.A fictional language was developed for use in the film by YouTube star Sara Forsberg, who created the viral video series "What Languages Sound Like To Foreigners"; Forsberg developed the language by studying various languages, such as Hindi and Gujarati.
In November 2015, Lucas recorded an hour-long interview with CBS News reporter Charlie Rose in which he said Disney had not been "keen" to involve him and conceded: "If I get in there, I'm just going to cause trouble because they're not going to do what I want them to do, and I don't have the control to do that any more, and all it would do is just muck everything up.
"
He also said, "They wanted to do a retro movie.
I don't like that.
Every movie, I worked very hard to make them different
[...] I made them completely different—different planets, different spaceships to make it new.
"
In early December 2015, Kathleen Kennedy told The Hollywood Reporter that Lucas had seen the movie and "liked it".
In the same month, at the Kennedy Center Honors, Lucas stated, "I think the fans are going to love it
, It's very much the kind of movie they've been looking for."
Abrams felt that, as the first in a new trilogy, the film "needed to take a couple of steps backwards into very familiar terrain" and use plot elements from previous Star Wars films.

=== Pre-production ===
In May 2013, it was confirmed that The Force Awakens would be filmed in the United Kingdom.
Representatives from Lucasfilm met with Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne to agree to produce The Force Awakens in the UK.
Osborne committed £25 million of public money towards the film, claiming it was a boost for British culture and its film industry.
According to production company account filings in the United Kingdom, The Force Awakens ultimately received a total of £31.6 million ($47.4 million) from the government.
Beginning in September 2013, production spaces at the Bad Robot facility were converted for shooting of The Force Awakens for the benefit of shooting a minor portion of the film in the United States.
The film's costume designer was Michael Kaplan, who had previously worked with Abrams on the films Star Trek (2009) and Star Trek Into Darkness (2013).
Film editors Mary Jo Markey and Maryann Brandon, long-term collaborators with Abrams, were also signed.
In August 2013, it was announced that cinematographer Daniel Mindel would be shooting the film on 35 mm film (specifically Kodak 5219).
In October 2013, other crew members were confirmed, including sound designer Ben Burtt, director of photography Mindel, production designers Rick Carter and Darren Gilford, costume designer Michael Kaplan, special effects supervisor Chris Corbould, re-recording mixer Gary Rydstrom, supervising sound editor Matthew Wood, visual effects supervisors Roger Guyett, and executive producer Jason McGatlin.
===
Casting ===
Open auditions were held in the United Kingdom and the United States in November 2013 for the roles of Rachel and Thomas.
Casting began in earnest in January 2014, because of changes to the script by Kasdan and Abrams.
Screen tests with actors continued until at least three weeks before the official announcement in April 2014, with final casting decisions made only a few weeks earlier.
Actors testing had strict nondisclosure agreements, preventing them, their agents or their publicists from commenting on their involvement.
Though Lucas intimated that previous cast members Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford, and Mark Hamill would return for the new film as early as March 2013, their casting was not confirmed until over a year later.
Saoirse Ronan, Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong'o and Frida Gustavsson, auditioned for new characters; industry publications reported Jesse Plemons was considered, possibly for Luke Skywalker's son;
Adam Driver for an unnamed villain; and Maisie Richardson-Sellers for an unknown character.
Daisy Ridley was cast by February 2014, and by the end of that month a deal had been worked out with Driver, who was able to work around his Girls schedule.
Talks with Andy Serkis and Oscar Isaac began by March and continued into April.
That same month, John Boyega began talks after dropping out of a Jesse Owens biopic.
Denis Lawson, who played Wedge Antilles in the original trilogy, declined to reprise his role, saying it would have "bored" him.
In April, the cast was announced with a photo of the first table read of the script at Pinewood Studios near London, picturing director Abrams with Ford, Ridley, Fisher, Peter Mayhew, producer Bryan Burk, Lucasfilm president and producer Kathleen Kennedy, Domhnall Gleeson, Anthony Daniels, Hamill, Serkis, Isaac, Boyega, Driver, and writer Lawrence Kasdan.
In June, cast additions Lupita Nyong'o and Gwendoline Christie were announced.
To prepare for his role, Hamill was assigned a personal trainer and a nutritionist at the request of the producers, who wanted him to resemble an older Luke.
Fisher was also assigned a personal trainer and a nutritionist.
Abrams initially considered using Daniels only in a voice role for C-3PO, but Daniels opted to reprise the role physically as well; the production team built a new C-3PO costume to accommodate him.
A flashback scene was cut from Rey's vision (following her discovery of Luke's lightsaber), which would have featured Robert Boulter standing in for Luke as he appeared in his duel with Vader in The Empire Strikes Back.
In May, Abrams announced a donation contest for UNICEF from the Star Wars set in Abu Dhabi; the winner was allowed to visit the set, meet members of the cast and appear in the film.
In October, Warwick Davis, who played Wicket in Return of the Jedi, as well as Wald and Weazle in The Phantom Menace (1999), announced that he would appear in The Force Awakens, but did not reveal his role.
In November, Debbie Reynolds confirmed that her granddaughter (Fisher's daughter), Billie Lourd, was in the film.

===
Filming ===
In February 2014, Abrams said filming would begin in May and last about three months.
The official announcement came in March, when Disney and Lucasfilm announced that principal photography would commence in May and be based at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire, England.
That month, it was revealed that pre-production filming would take place in Iceland prior to the start of official filming in May, consisting of landscape shots that would be used for scenery in the film.
In April, Walt Disney Studios chairman Alan Horn confirmed that filming had begun, filming in secret in the United Arab Emirates around Liwa Oasis, part of the emirate of Abu Dhabi, by a second unit.
Later that month, it was revealed that in addition to 35 mm film, segments of the film were being shot in the 65 mm IMAX format.
In July, Bad Robot reported via Twitter that the film would be at least partially shot on IMAX cameras.
Principal photography began in Abu Dhabi on May 16, 2014.
Abrams and the cast members went to Abu Dhabi in early-May, where large sets were built on location—including a shuttle-like spacecraft, a large tower, and a big market—and where explosives were used to create a "blast crater".
Cast members were spotted practicing driving vehicles that would be used during filming.
Production moved to Pinewood Studios in June.

That same month, Harrison Ford fractured his leg while filming at Pinewood after a hydraulic door on the Millennium Falcon set fell on him, and was taken to a hospital.
According to Abrams, Ford's ankle "went to a 90-degree angle".
Production was suspended for two weeks because of Ford's injury.
Ford's son Ben said the ankle would likely need a plate and screws and that filming could be altered slightly, with the crew needing to shoot Ford from the waist up for a short time until he recovered.
A month later, Jake Steinfeld, Ford's personal trainer, said Ford was recovering rapidly.
Abrams also suffered a fractured vertebra in his back when he was trying to help lift the door after Ford's accident, but he kept this to himself for over a month.
In February 2016, it was reported that the Health and Safety Executive brought four criminal charges against Disney subsidiary Foodles Production (UK), Ltd. for alleged health and safety breaches relating to Ford's accident.
Foodles Production (UK) Ltd was subsequently fined $1.95 million in October 2016 for two health and safety breaches, after admitting the counts at an earlier hearing.
In July 2014, filming took place over three days at Skellig Michael, an island off the coast of County Kerry, Ireland, with a cast including Mark Hamill and Daisy Ridley.
Landscape shots for the planet
Takodana were shot in July in the Lake District in the northwest of England.
Production was halted for two weeks in early August 2014
so Abrams could rework shooting in Ford's absence and resumed with a fully healed Ford in mid-August.
In September, the former RAF Greenham Common military base in Berkshire was used and featured set constructions of several spaceships.
Puzzlewood in the Forest of Dean Gloucestershire England was used for some scenes.
Principal photography ended on November 3, 2014.

===
Post-production ===
Kathleen Kennedy said The Force Awakens would use real locations and models over computer-generated imagery.
Rian Johnson, director of The Last Jedi, reiterated that Abrams would use little CGI and more practical, traditional special effects, saying: "I think people are coming back around to [practical effects].
It feels like there is sort of that gravity pulling us back toward it.
I think that more and more people are hitting kind of a critical mass in terms of the CG-driven action scene lending itself to a very specific type of action scene, where physics go out the window and it becomes so big so quick."
Abrams' intention in prioritizing practical special effects was to recreate the visual realism and authenticity of the original Star Wars.
To that end, the droid BB-8 was a physical prop developed by Disney Research, created by special effects artist Neal Scanlan and operated live on set with the actors.
In February 2014, Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) announced plans to open a facility in London, citing Disney's Star Wars films as a catalyst for the expansion.
ILM's Vancouver branch also worked on the special effects for the film.
Abrams supervised post-production and editing of the film at Bad Robot Productions' headquarters in Santa Monica.
In August 2015, he gave the film's estimated running time as 124 minutes.
Abrams made changes to the film's plot in the editing process to simplify the film, by removing some sequences shown in trailers: "At one point, Maz used to continue along with the characters back to the Resistance base, but we realised that she really had nothing to do there of value [...]
So we ended up leaving those things out.
"On
November 6, 2014, the film's title was announced as Star Wars: The Force Awakens.
In December 2015, Pablo Hidalgo, the creative executive at the Lucasfilm Story Group which handles all the canonical continuity for the Star Wars universe, revealed that the working title for the film was Shadow of the Empire "for the longest time".

===
Music ===
In July 2013, John Williams was confirmed to return to compose the sequel trilogy, beginning with The Force Awakens.
He began working on the film in December 2014, and by June 2015 had been through most of the film reels, working on a daily basis.
In May 2015, Williams said he would return to themes from the previous films, such as those for Luke, Leia, and Han, in ways that "there are a few that I think are important and will seem very much a part of the fabric of the piece in a positive and constructive way."
He said that working with Abrams was similar to the process he went through with Lucas in the earlier films.
Recording sessions for The Force Awakens began in June 2015 at the Sony Pictures Studios' Barbra Streisand Scoring Stage in Culver City, with William Ross conducting most of the music.
The first day of recording was June 1, 2015.
Williams attended the sessions and conducted the remainder of the recordings in Los Angeles.
The score was recorded in 12 sessions within a five-month period between June and mid-November.
The 90-piece orchestra recorded 175 minutes of music; however, Abrams reedited the film, which discarded, modified, or rerecorded the score's part for nearly an hour.
Williams' theme for Snoke was recorded by a 24-voice men's chorus.
Gustavo Dudamel conducted the opening and end title music for the film at Williams' behest.
Recording of the score was completed on November 14, 2015.
The film's soundtrack was released by Walt Disney Records on December 18, 2015.
Williams' score is more than two hours long.
Lin-Manuel Miranda and Abrams contributed music to the film's cantina scene.
Abrams met Miranda at a performance of his Broadway musical Hamilton, where Miranda jokingly offered to compose cantina music, should it be needed.
Unknown to Miranda, Williams had previously told Abrams that he did not want to compose the music for that scene, wanting to focus on the orchestral score.
Abrams then contacted Miranda, and the two collaborated on the music for the scene over a period of two months.

===
Promotion ===
Disney backed The Force Awakens with extensive marketing campaigns.
On November 28, 2014, Lucasfilm released an 88-second teaser trailer.
It was screened in selected cinemas across the United States and Canada and in theaters worldwide in December 2014.
It was also released on YouTube and the iTunes Store, generating 58.2 million views on YouTube in its first week.
Critics compared the brief footage favorably to the production values of the original trilogy.
The Hollywood Reporter called the trailer "perfectly potent nostalgia", praising its mix of old and new.
Empire was impressed by the continuity with the first films—"the feel of classic Star Wars"—but noted the absence of Hamill, Ford, and Fisher and speculated about the significance of the new characters.
The Guardian wrote that the use of the Star Wars fanfare by John Williams reinforced brand loyalty among fans.

On December 11, 2014, Abrams and Kennedy released a series of eight mock Topps trading cards revealing the names of several characters.
On April 16, 2015, a second teaser trailer, this one lasting two minutes, was shown at the opening panel at the Star Wars Celebration in Anaheim, California.
Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy said the reaction to the trailer was "staggering [...]
the entire room of almost eight thousand people just leapt to their feet and roared,
I mean I can't think of anything I've ever been to—other than a rock concert—
that felt quite like that".
The trailer was viewed over 88 million times within the first 24 hours of release.
The trailer shows many of the new characters and the first footage of Chewbacca and Han Solo.
The Huffington Post's Graham Milne wrote that the trailer "was an affirmation of something that we'd long been told was never going to happen.
This was a gift.
This was faith rewarded.
About damn time.
"Vanity
Fair was the first magazine to release an exclusive cover issue devoted to The Force Awakens.
The magazine, released on May 7, 2015, featured exclusive interviews and photos of the cast photographed by Annie Leibovitz.
At the 2015 San Diego Comic-Con International, in addition to a panel with many of the actors, a behind-the-scenes look at the film demonstrated the film's use of practical sets and effects.
It was positively received, with Nigel M. Smith of The Guardian writing: "
The featurette's angle is a strong one and connects with fans of the original trilogy in an incredibly poignant way.
It also does a sly job of teasing Fisher's new look as Leia and Simon Pegg's mysterious involvement as a rumored alien in the movie, without actually showing the actors in action.
"
Smith compared the marketing strategy for the film to that of a previous Abrams film, Super 8, saying "the promos [...] are notable for what they tease, not what they give away.
"Walt
Disney Studios and Lucasfilm presented a look at The Force Awakens at Disney's D23 Expo in August 2015.
Drew Struzan—who designed the poster artwork for the previous Star Wars films—produced a commemorative poster given to the event's attendees.
In October 2015, Lucasfilm unveiled the theatrical release poster and a third trailer.
The poster omitted Luke Skywalker and revealed a Death Star-like "orb".
The trailer debuted during the halftime break of Monday Night Football, before being released online.
The reaction to the trailer by fans on social media was "frenzied", with Lizo Mzimba of the BBC writing that "perhaps the most significant thing about the final trailer before the film's release is how little of the story it reveals."
Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph felt the trailer was "a perfect blend of old and new, in keeping with the old-fashioned Star Wars aesthetic".
The trailer received 128 million views in 24 hours.
16 million of the views came from its airing on Monday Night Football.
At the end of October, Air France announced a "Flight and Cinema" package, providing customers who book select flights to Paris transportation to a theater to see the film, since France was one of the first countries to release the film.
On November 23, a partnership with Google was announced, in which Google users could choose to affiliate themselves with either the Dark or Light Side, which would change the appearance of their Google websites.
Additionally, Disney teamed up with Verizon to create a virtual-reality experience for Google Cardboard.
On December 17, 2015, select theaters across the United States and Canada aired a Star Wars marathon, airing the six previous Star Wars episode films in 2D, followed by The Force Awakens in 3D.
Attendees received a special lanyard featuring exclusive marathon art.

===
Tie-in literature and merchandise ===
Disney Publishing Worldwide and Lucasfilm announced a series of at least 20 books and comics, "Journey to Star Wars:
The Force Awakens", which were released by multiple publishers starting in late 2015, prior to the film's premiere.
The series includes books by Del Rey and Disney-Lucasfilm publishers and comic books from Marvel Comics.
All titles under the program are canonical to the Star Wars universe.
Alan Dean Foster wrote a novelization of The Force Awakens which was released in e-book form on December 18.
In an effort to avoid revealing plot details before the film's release, the print release of the novelization was delayed until January 2016.
Marvel Comics published a six-issue comic book adaptation of The Force Awakens between June and November 2016.Disney Consumer Products and Lucasfilm announced that September 4, 2015 would be deemed "Force Friday" and would be the official launch of all the merchandise for The Force Awakens.
Beginning at 12:01 am, fans could buy toys, books, clothing and various other products at Disney Stores and other retailers throughout the world.
Disney and Maker Studios hosted an 18-hour live-streaming presentation on YouTube, showcasing multiple merchandise products beginning on September 3, 2015.
Among these products were a remote-controlled BB-8 developed by Sphero.
Sphero had participated in a Disney-run startup accelerator in July 2014, where they were invited into a private meeting with Disney CEO Bob Iger, in which they were shown on-set photos and imagery of BB-8 before its public unveiling.
Many retailers, such as Toys "R" Us, were unable to meet demand for Star Wars products due to the event.

===
Video games ===
The Force Awakens is the first Star Wars film to not have a direct tie-in game to accompany it.
Instead, select characters, scenes and/or locations from the film became part of other Star Wars video games:
Characters from the film were added to an update to the mobile game
Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, available for iOS and Android and released by Electronic Arts;
free downloadable content for Electronic Arts' Star Wars Battlefront reboot allowed players to battle on the planet Jakku; an update to the mobile game Star Wars Commander, released by Disney Mobile for iOS, Android and the Windows Store, allowed players to battle on the planet
Takodana during the Galactic Civil War era; and a condensed version of the film's plot becomes an add-on "playset" in the toys-to-life game Disney Infinity 3.0, with Finn, Rey, Poe Dameron, and Kylo Ren as playable characters.
Eventually, the film got a full Lego video game adaptation, titled Lego Star Wars:
The Force Awakens, which was released by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo 3DS, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, Wii U, Xbox 360, and Xbox One on June 28, 2016.

Theatrical ===
Star Wars:
The Force Awakens premiered in Los Angeles at the TCL Chinese Theatre, El Capitan Theatre, and Dolby Theatre on December 14, 2015.
A white tent stretched along Hollywood Boulevard from Orange Drive to Highland Avenue, covering the "massive" premiere event that hosted more than five thousand guests.
The film was released in 12 countries, including European nations (such as Italy and France), the Philippines, and Thailand on December 16; 32 countries including the United Kingdom, Mexico, and additional European, Asian, African, South American, and Oceania countries on December 17; and in the United States and Canada, Japan, Spain, and Venezuela on December 18, in 3D and IMAX 3D.
It was released in India on December 25 and in China on January 9
, 2016.In the United States and Canada, it had the widest release of December across 4,134 theaters, of which 3,300 were 3D locations, a record 392 IMAX screens (13 of which were 70mm), 451 premium large format screens, 146 D-Box locations, as well as releasing in the Dolby Vision format (high-dynamic range, Rec.
2020 color) in Dolby Cinema.
Worldwide, it was released across 940 IMAX theaters, a new record.
On December 18, 2015, the film began playing on every IMAX screen in the United States and Canada for four straight weeks up to January 14, 2016.
This made it the first film since Warner Bros.' The Hobbit trilogy to receive such a release.
The film finally shed some of its IMAX screens with the release of The Revenant (2015) and The Finest Hours (2016) in mid-January 2016.Advance ticket sales for the film began on October 19, 2015, and were in strong demand, resulting in online movie ticket sites crashing.
Vue Cinemas, the United Kingdom's third-largest theater chain, sold 45,000 tickets in 24 hours, 10,000 of which were sold in 90 minutes, a record for the theater.
In the United States, the film pre-sold a record-breaking $6.5 million worth of IMAX ticket sales on a single day.
IMAX has never previously registered more than $1 million in pre-sales on a single day.
In total, it sold over $50 million in pre-sales, breaking the record.
This number was raised to $100 million including $50–60 million in advance ticket sales by December 14.
However, not all tickets that were pre-sold were for the film's opening weekend, with
Fandango President Paul Yanover saying "people have set aside tickets for screenings in January, weeks after the big opening [...]
We have people buying Star Wars [The Force Awakens] into 2016.
It's not just an opening-weekend phenomenon.
"
Similarly, the film broke pre-sales records in the UK, Canada, and Germany.
The Force Awakens is the first live-action Star Wars film not to be released theatrically by 20th Century Fox; accordingly the film is not introduced with either that company's logo, or its signature fanfare composed by Alfred Newman.
Instead, the film is the first in the series to be distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, and the film is presented with only Lucasfilm's production logo shown silently before the main titles.
Disney chairman Bob Iger explained that the decision not to place Disney branding on the film was "for the fans".

Box office ===
Star Wars:
The Force Awakens grossed $936.7 million in the United States and Canada, and $1.132 billion in other countries for a worldwide total of $2.068 billion.
Box Office Mojo estimates that the film sold close to 110 million tickets in the United States and Canada.
The Force Awakens earned 8.6% of the total 2015 releases in the United States and Canada, second only to the 8.8% of the box office earned by Titanic in 1997.
It was the 24th film in cinematic history to gross $1 billion worldwide, standing as the fastest film to surpass the mark at the time, doing so in 12 days.
It was also the third film in history to surpass $2 billion worldwide, doing so on its 53rd day of release.
Deadline Hollywood calculated the net profit of the film to be $780.1 million, when factoring together all expenses and revenues for the film, making it the most profitable film of 2015.

Commercial analysis ====
With a production budget of $259–306 million, plus $175 million for marketing, printing and advertising costs, The Force Awakens was predicted to be a major box office success.
The cost of the film was subsidized by £31.6 million (US$47 million) from the UK film incentive program.
Total costs, after accounting for profit participations, production and distribution of home videos, as well as other ancillary mediums, is expected to run $423 million.
Reports in April 2015 from The Hollywood Reporter and Amboee Brand Intelligence predicted the film would earn up to $540 million worldwide for its opening, breaking the record for the biggest worldwide opening, as well as breaking the record for the biggest U.S. opening.
They believed that The Force Awakens would have the widest release ever, across 4,500 theaters in the United States and Canada.
Instead, it received a total of 4,134 theaters, and had the widest December opening.
Box office analyst Phil Contrino likened the film to Avatar (2009), which opened to $77 million in the United States and Canada and went on to earn $2.8 billion worldwide, saying The Force Awakens would earn $1 billion "without blinking" and could gross $2 billion.
In August 2015, Deadline Hollywood predicted an opening weekend of $615 million worldwide could be possible, including a $300 million opening in the United States and Canada.
Months prior to the film's release, box office analysts reported opening weekend projections were at $175–250 million.
Analysts said that the box office receipts of the film, when compared to predecessors, must be adjusted for inflation, and that the first Star Wars film made more when this adjustment is made.
It has further been observed that each of the first three films in the series was more profitable in calculating revenue against production costs.
Box office analyst Paul Dergarabedian said that while Avatar and The Force Awakens were both released on the same date of December 18, higher ticket prices in 2015 and IMAX screenings could push Star Wars "into the box office stratosphere".
By January 13, analysts concluded that it was unlikely that The Force Awakens would surpass Avatar's global gross.
While The Force Awakens was very successful in the United States and Canada, the same success was not witnessed in many overseas individual markets such as Germany, India, Latin America, and parts of Asia.
One cited reason for this is that overseas audiences do not have the same nostalgia or affinity for the film as those in the U.S.
The Star Wars franchise has traditionally lacked resonance with filmgoers in China, and marketing for The Force Awakens heavily focused on appealing to that market.
Nancy Tartaglione of Deadline Hollywood argued that, if accounting for its 40/60 domestic to international split, The Force Awakens did well overseas.
Avatar did well internationally because of its novelty, the marketing campaign advertising it as showcasing the newest 3D technology that can only be fully appreciated in the theaters, and because of its extended time in overseas theaters.
While The Force Awakens had appeal with its special effects, analysts felt that it lacked the novelty factor; they also cited that its gross was stilted due to markets making way for new films sooner than was previously done, and for films not playing in overseas theaters as long as they did back when Avatar was released.
Dergarabedian stated, "No matter what, [The Force Awakens] is an absolute, all-out blockbuster without peer in terms of the sheer speed at which it has crossed all of these major box-office milestones."
Moreover, Mike Fleming of Deadline Hollywood argued that the movie was the "most valuable movie" of the year, with "the net profit to Disney was an astounding $780.11M, and the Cash on Cash Return was twice that of any other film [released in 2016], at 2.00".
====
United States and Canada ====
In the United States and Canada, The Force Awakens was released on December 18, 2015.
It made a record-breaking $57 million from Thursday night previews, of which IMAX screenings generated a record-breaking $5.7 million from 391 screens.
On its opening day, the film grossed $119.1 million, marking the biggest single- and opening-day record and the first time a film has earned more than $100 million in a single day.
Without Thursday-night grosses, the film earned the second-largest opening-day gross and a record of $247.9 million for its opening weekend.
The debut was 19% bigger than the previous record holders
The Avengers (2012) ($207 million) and Jurassic World (2015) ($208 million).
The opening weekend figure included an IMAX opening-weekend record of $30.1 million (12.65%) from 391 IMAX theaters, which nearly amounts to the $252.5 million total earned by Return of the Jedi—the second-lowest-grossing film in the series—in its original run.
2D screenings accounted for 53% of the total opening gross while 3D accounted for 47%.
RealD 3D comprised $78 million of the opening gross, setting a new record.
Revenues in the film's second weekend decreased by only 39.8% in the United States and Canada, earning $149.2 million, to remain in first place at the box office and recording the biggest second weekend of all time.
On January 2, after just 16 days of release, it became the second film (following Avatar) to gross over $700 million in the United States and Canada, and on January 6 became the highest-grossing film of all time domestically, doing so in 20 days.
On January 9, it became the first film in cinematic history to cross $800 million domestically unadjusted for inflation.
On February 5, The Force Awakens became the first film to earn over $900 million, unadjusted for inflation, in the United States and Canada.
The film fell outside of the top ten for the first time in its eleventh weekend during the weekend February 26–28, 2016, and did not achieve $1 million in ticket sales for the first time in its fourteenth weekend.

====
Other territories ====
Internationally, the film was released in over 30,000 screens.
It opened on December 16, 2015, in 12 international markets and earned $14.1 million on its opening day, debuting at first place in all of them.

Other markets which generated large opening days were Spain ($3.5 million) and Japan ($3 million).
After the five days, The Force Awakens had a total international opening gross of $281 million from 30,000 screens, a new record for December opening and the third-biggest international opening of all time.
International markets generating opening-weekend tallies of at least $10 million were the United Kingdom ($50.6 million), Germany ($27.5 million), France ($22.5 million), Australia ($19.6 million), Japan ($13.4 million), and Russia ($12.3 million).
The film had the biggest opening of all time in 18 countries including the United Kingdom, Germany, Australia, Russia, and Sweden.
After five days, the film had a total worldwide opening record of $529 million from 74 territories, which was the biggest worldwide opening at that time, making it only the second time in cinematic history—after Jurassic World—that a film had opened to more than $500 million globally.
This included an IMAX opening record of $48 million.
Revenues from IMAX dipped slightly, generating $19 million in its second weekend, for a record total of over $70 million in 11 days.
IMAX generated $17.9 million from 276 IMAX theaters.
The film had a steeper decline in its second weekend, falling 51% to $136.9 million.
Of the notable major markets, the film had an unsuccessful opening in India where it opened third against two local blockbusters with a mere $1.51 million.
As of February 21, the largest markets outside of the United States and Canada are the United Kingdom ($180.7 million), China ($124.5 million), Germany ($109.7 million), Japan ($92.6 million), and France ($88.2 million).
On January 17, 2016, it passed the $1 billion mark overseas becoming the first film of Disney, the third film of 2015 and the fifth film overall to achieve this feat.
It topped the international box office chart for five consecutive weekends, becoming the first film since Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015) to have five straight wins, before being dethroned by The Revenant in its sixth weekend.
In Japan, it topped the box office for six straight weekends.

Critical response ===
Star Wars:
The Force Awakens received overwhelmingly positive reviews from critics.
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 92% of 439 reviews are positive, with an average rating of 8.20/10.
The website's critical consensus reads, "Packed with action and populated by both familiar faces and fresh blood
, The Force Awakens successfully recalls the series' former glory while injecting it with renewed energy."
According to the review aggregator Metacritic, which sampled 55 reviews and calculated a weighted average of 80 out of 100, The Force Awakens received "generally favorable reviews".
Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "A" on an A+ to F scale; women, and people under the ages of 25 and 18 gave it an "A+", while 98% of audiences gave it either an "A" or a "B".
Audiences polled by PostTrak gave the film an 88% "definite recommend" while 96% said it met or exceeded their expectations.
Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph said the film "sets out to shake Star Wars from its slumber, and reconnect the series with its much-pined-for past", and "it achieves this both immediately and joyously
is perhaps the single greatest relief of the movie-going year."
Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian said that it was "both a narrative progression from the earlier three films and a shrewdly affectionate next-gen reboot", and it was "ridiculous and melodramatic and sentimental, but exciting and brimming with energy and its own kind of generosity.
"
Variety's Justin Chang wrote that the film has "sufficient style, momentum, love, and care to prove irresistible to any who have ever considered themselves fans".
Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times described it as "a beautiful, thrilling, joyous, surprising, and heart-thumping adventure".
Ann Hornaday, writing for The Washington Post, thought the film had "enough novelty to create yet another cohort of die-hard fans", and the film struck "all the right chords, emotional, and narrative, to feel both familiar and exhilaratingly new."
The Charlotte Observer's Lawrence Toppman said Abrams had "pulled off a delicate balancing act, paying clever homage to the past."
Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film his highest rating and called it "the best Star Wars sequel yet and one of the best films of 2015".
Frank Pallotta, reviewing the film for CNN Business, found it was the best Star Wars film since the original trilogy and that it "is bound to be a film experience long remembered by fans and non-fans
alike".
Certain critics found The Force Awakens derivative of the original Star Wars trilogy, some expressing their opinion that the film was essentially a remake of A New Hope.
Tom Long of The Detroit News wrote that though some may find the film too similar to the original Star Wars, it leaves "the ungainly and unneeded clumsiness of the subsequent prequels far behind", with "the energy, humor, and simplicity of direction [has] been recaptured".
The Tribune-Star called it "basically the same" as the original film but "isn't that what we all wanted anyway?"
Stephanie Zacharek of Time wrote that Abrams had delivered "everything we expect, as opposed to those nebulous wonders we didn't know we wanted".
Reviewing for Forbes, Scott Mendelson cited the film's "top-tier production values and a strong sense of scale and scope", but felt it was so much "an exercise in fan service [that] it is only due to the charisma and talent of our newbies and J. J. Abrams' undeniable skill as a visual storyteller that the Mad Libs narrative doesn't outright destroy the picture".
Brian Merchant of Motherboard said that the film "is supposed to be all about exploring the unexplored, not rehashing the well-trod", and is "one of the most unabashedly creative enterprises of the 20th century has been rendered another largely enjoyable."
RogerEbert.com's Gerardo Valero went as far as to accuse the film of plagiarizing A New Hope and resorting to nostalgia.
He felt that it "didn't [justify] a return to the universe" from not having an original story of its own to tell in the plot, characters, and musical score, negatively comparing it to George Lucas' prequel trilogy, and that some of its climactic moments felt unearned.
In an interview with journalist Charlie Rose that aired on December 24, 2015, Lucas likened his decision to sell Lucasfilm to Disney to a "divorce" and outlined the creative differences between him and the producers of The Force Awakens.
Lucas described the previous Star Wars films as his "children" and criticized the "retro feel" of The Force Awakens, saying: "I worked very hard to make [my films] completely different, with different planets, with different spaceships—you know, to make it new."
Lucas also likened Disney to "white slavers", which drew some criticism; he subsequently apologized.
In a 2019 memoir, Disney chairman Bob Iger said that George Lucas "couldn't even hide his disappointment" towards J. J. Abrams' interpretation.
According to Iger, Lucas said, "there's nothing new" after seeing the film, and that "there weren't enough visual or technical leaps forward".
Lucas preferred Rian Johnson's sequel The Last Jedi and the anthology film Rogue One (2016).

Accolades ===

This list of characters from the Star Wars franchise contains only those which are considered part of the official Star Wars canon, as of the changes made by Lucasfilm in April 2014.
Following its acquisition by The Walt Disney Company in 2012, Lucasfilm rebranded most of the novels, comics, video games and other works produced since the originating 1977 film Star Wars as Star Wars Legends and declared them non-canon to the rest of the franchise.
As such, the list contains only information from the Skywalker Saga films, the 2008 animated TV series Star Wars: The Clone Wars, and works published after April 2014.

The list is organized in humans and various alien species.
No droid characters are included, so for those, see the list of Star Wars droid characters.
Some of the characters featured in this list have additional or alternate plotlines in the non-canonical Legends continuity.
To see those or characters who do not exist at all in the current Star Wars canon, see the list of Star Wars Legends characters and list of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic characters.

==
Humans ==
Humans are a sentient, sapient species in the fictional Star Wars universe.
They are the most numerous and dominant species, with apparently millions of major and minor colonies galaxywide.
Humans are native to many different worlds and are characterized by multidimensional complex personalities, that are both individual and unique.
They are the only race accepted as pure by Emperor Palpatine.

By the time the hyperdrive was invented, humans were already present on a few scattered worlds throughout the galaxy; according to the New Essential Chronology, the humans of Coruscant managed to send out a number of 'sleeper ships' between the fall of the Rakatan Infinite Empire and the invention of the hyperdrive.
Star Wars humans are mostly biologically identical to real-life humans.
The presence of ordinary humans in the story is important dramatically and the first movie establishes their vulnerability and weakness.
Luke Skywalker's introduction early in the first movie was rewritten to establish this.
In the Star Wars mythology, the human homeworld, according to the New Essential Chronology, is generally believed to be Coruscant.
However, there is actually no real consensus on the issue; according to releases from the official Starwars.com site, the ancient human home world has simply been lost to history.

Star Wars humans live on many different worlds throughout the galaxy, with many populations living together with several other species—something which is most common either on the cosmopolitan worlds at the core, such as on Coruscant, or on the frontier at the Outer Rim of the galaxy, such as on Tatooine.

Skywalker and Solo families ===


====
Extended family ====
Naberrie family - Padmé Amidala's family
Lars family - Luke's adoptive familyOrgana
family - Leia's adoptive family


===
Force-wielders ===
Human Force-sensitive characters.
They are divided into Jedi and those affiliated with the light side of the Force; and Sith and those affiliated with the dark side (such as Dark Jedi, who are former Jedi who have fallen to the dark side, and Inquisitors, who are Jedi hunters trained by Darth Vader and serving the Empire).
===
Mandalorians ===
Mandalorians are a culture of humans from the planet Mandalore with strong warrior traditions.
Most of them wear armor and helmets, the strongest ones made from beskar, a blaster-resistant steel that is originally from Mandalore.
The Mandalorian culture was carried on by humans from Mandalore around the galaxy.
The name of their home planet, "Mandalore", is the same as the title given to their leader.
The Mandalorians are also associated with the Darksaber, a black-bladed lightsaber built by Tarre Vizsla, the first Mandalorian Jedi, which has since become a symbol of power for the Mandalorian people and is passed from a leader to the next.
===
Galactic Republic ===
The Galactic Republic is a democractic government, overseen by a Galactic Senate, that governed most of the known galaxy for thousands of years.
With the help of the Jedi Order, it maintained intergalactic peace, but during its last years, it became highly corrupt, causing numerous planets and systems to abandon the Republic and form the Confederacy of Independent Systems.
The ensuing conflict between the two factions became known as the Clone Wars, which Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, secretly the Sith Lord Darth Sidious and the mastermind behind the war, took advantage of to manipulate the Republic's Senators and citizens into supporting his plans for the government's reorganization into the Galactic Empire for the purpose of intergalactic "peace".
The Republic serves as the protagonist faction of the prequel trilogy, which depicts its downfall and conversion into the Empire.

====
Clone troopers ====
Clone troopers were the soldiers of the Galactic Republic's army during the Clone Wars.
Created from Jango Fett's DNA, they were genetically modified to have accelerated growth and be predisposed toward unquestioning obedience to the chain of command, including being outfitted with mind-controlling biochips, which were put to use during Order 66, when the clone troopers turned on and tried to kill their Jedi Generals.

===
Confederacy of Independent Systems ===
The Confederacy of Independent Systems (CIS) is an organization of multiple planets and systems formerly part of the Galactic Republic, who decided to secess after becoming annoyed with the corruption and injustice within the Galactic Senate.
Formed by Count Dooku under the orders of his master, Darth Sidious, it is the main antagonistic faction of the prequel trilogy.
Most of the planets that made up the Confederacy attempted to earn their freedom by force, engaging in the three year-long Clone Wars with the Republic using an army of battle droids.
Once Sidious achieved his goal of scaring the people of the Republic into supporting his plans for the formation of a Galactic Empire, he ended the Clone Wars by having his new apprentice, Darth Vader, kill the Separatist Council leaders.
The remaining systems of the Confederacy were subsequently reabsorbed into the newly formed Empire.
===
Rebel Alliance ===
The Rebel Alliance is an organization of multiple planets and systems that oppose the rule of the Galactic Empire, with which it engages in the five year-long Galactic Civil War.
It serves as the protagonist faction of the original trilogy.
The Partisans are a faction or rebels led by Saw Gerrera known for their extreme methods, who have distanced themselves from the rest of the Alliance.
Rogue One is a squad of Rebel soldiers formed in the film of the same name that embarked on a suicide mission to steal the Death Star's schematics.

====
Erso and Gerrera families ====


===
Galactic Empire ===
The First Galactic Empire is an autocracy formed by Emperor Palpatine at the end of the Clone Wars, replacing the old Galactic Republic.
Palpatine's rise to power and manipulation of the Galactic Senate into supporting his plans for the formation of an empire and extermination of the Jedi Order with the purpose of intergalactic "peace" are depicted in the prequel trilogy.
In the original trilogy, the Empire serves as the main antagonistic faction.
At its peak, the Empire sprawled most of the known Star Wars galaxy.
The Empire was eventually defeated by the Rebel Alliance and collapsed, but some remnants continued to exist for 30 years and reunited to form the First Order.

The stormtroopers are the elite, faceless shock troops serving the Empire's military.
Originally the clone troopers of the Republic's army, over time they became mostly human recruits.

===
Resistance ===
The Resistance is a military organization founded and led by Leia Organa, and the successor of the Rebel Alliance.
It fought against the First Order to defend the New Republic and maintain peace in the galaxy, 30 years after the conclusion of the Galactic Civil War.
It is the protagonist faction of the sequel trilogy.

===
New Republic ===
The New Republic is a democractic government established in the aftermath of the Galactic Empire's defeat.
Formed from the Rebel Alliance and meant to be a restoration of the old Galactic Republic, it governed most of the known galaxy, until it fell after the First Order destroyed its capital, the Hosnian Prime system.
The New Republic is only briefly featured in the sequel trilogy, but has a more prominent presence in related works.
===
First Order ===
The First Order is an autocratic military dictatorship and the successor of the Galactic Empire, formed from its remnants.
Its main goal is to overthrow the New Republic and destroy the Resistance and Luke Skywalker, the last Jedi.
It is the central antagonistic faction of the sequel trilogy.
Ruled by Supreme Leader Snoke, a Force-sensitive being created by the resurrected Darth Sidious to act as his puppet ruler, the First Order succeeded in destroying the New Republic and conquering much of the known galaxy, especially during Kylo Ren's reign, who killed Snoke and became the next Supreme Leader.
Near the end of its one-year-long war with the Resistance, it allied itself with the Sith Eternal, a secret cult of Sith loyalists led by Sidious on Exegol, though both were ultimately defeated by the remains of the Resistance and the civilians of the galaxy, who finally gathered the courage to rise against their oppressors.

Much like the Empire before it, the First Order uses stormtroopers as its main military.
Most stormtroopers are children who had been abducted from their homes and brainwashed into serving the First Order.

Production ==


===
Development ===
In October 2012, Star Wars creator George Lucas sold his production company Lucasfilm to The Walt Disney Company.
Disney announced a new trilogy of Star Wars films.
J. J. Abrams was named director of the first episode in the trilogy, The Force Awakens, in January 2013.
In June 2014, director Rian Johnson was reported to be in talks to write and direct its sequel, Episode VIII, and to write a treatment for the third film, Episode IX, with Ram Bergman producing both films.
Johnson confirmed in August that he would direct Episode VIII.In January 2015, Disney CEO Bob Iger stated that Episode VIII would be released in 2017.
In December, Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy said that the film had not been mapped out and that Abrams was collaborating with Johnson, who would in turn work with (then)
Episode IX director Colin Trevorrow to ensure a smooth transition.
Additionally, Abrams served as an executive producer along with Tom Karnowski and Jason McGatlin.
In January 2017, Lucasfilm announced the title for Episode VIII as Star Wars: The Last Jedi.

===
Writing ===
The Last Jedi story begins immediately after The Force Awakens.
Johnson had his story group watch films such as Twelve O'Clock High (1949),
The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957), Gunga Din (1939), Three Outlaw Samurai (1964), Sahara (1943), and Letter Never Sent (1960) for inspiration while developing ideas.
He felt it was difficult to work on the film while The Force Awakens was being finished.
Johnson wrote the scene with the mirrored versions of Rey to symbolise her search for identity; when she asks for a vision of her parents, she sees only herself.
Rey learns that her parents were "nobodies" as it would be "the hardest thing" she and the audience could hear; Johnson likened the scene to Luke Skywalker learning that Darth Vader is his father in The Empire Strikes
Back (1980).
During production, Hamill expressed disagreement with the direction of his character, Luke, feeling his character's disillusioned state was at odds with his character.
Hamill later said he regretted making his initial misgivings public and compared his disagreements to his clashes with George Lucas during the filming of Return of the Jedi (1983).

===
Casting ===
In September 2015, Disney shortlisted the female cast members to Gina Rodriguez, Tatiana Maslany, and Olivia Cooke.
That same month, Benicio del Toro confirmed his involvement in the film, but denied that he was playing a villain, and Mark Hamill was also confirmed.
Joaquin Phoenix was also courted to portray the role of DJ, but would end up passing on the offer.
In October 2015, Gugu Mbatha-Raw was rumored to have been cast in the film.
In November, Kennedy announced at the London premiere of The Force Awakens that the entire cast would return for Episode VIII, along with "a handful" of new cast members.
In February 2016, at the start of filming, it was confirmed that Laura Dern and Kelly Marie Tran had been cast in undisclosed roles.
In April 2017, at the Star Wars Celebration Orlando, Lucasfilm announced that Tran would play Resistance maintenance worker Rose Tico, which Johnson described as the film's largest new role.
To keep Frank Oz's return as Yoda a secret, producers excluded Oz's name in the billing for the film's pre-release marketing and ensured that Oz stayed on set during filming.

===
Filming ===
Second unit photography began during pre-production at Skellig Michael in Ireland on September 14, 2015, due to the difficulties of filming at that location during other seasons.
It would have lasted five days, but filming was canceled for the first day due to poor weather and rough conditions.
In September 2015, del Toro revealed that principal photography would begin in March 2016.
The production began work on the 007 Stage at Pinewood Studios on November 15, 2015.
Rick Heinrichs served as production designer.
In January 2016, production of Episode VIII was delayed until February due to script rewrites.
Filming was in danger of being delayed further due to an upcoming strike between the Producers Alliance for Cinema and Television and the Broadcasting, Entertainment, Cinematograph and Theatre Union.
On February 10, 2016, Disney CEO Bob Iger confirmed that principal photography had begun under the working title Space Bear.
Additional filming took place in Dubrovnik, Croatia from March 9 to 16, as well as in Ireland in
May. Malin Head in County Donegal and a mountain headland, Ceann Sibeal in County Kerry, served as additional filming locations.
To increase the scenes' intimacy Driver and Ridley were both present when filming Kylo and Rey's Force visions.
Location filming for the battle scenes on the planet
Crait took place at the Salar de Uyuni salt flats in Bolivia.
Additional filming took place in Mexico.
Principal photography wrapped on July 22, 2016, though as of early September, Nyong'o had not filmed her scenes.
In February 2017, it was announced that sequences from the film were shot in IMAX.
Production designer Rick Heinrichs said the original script called for 160 sets, double what might be expected, but that Johnson did some "trimming and cutting".
Ultimately, 125 sets were created on 14 sound stages at Pinewood Studios.
According to creature designer Neal Scanlan, The Last Jedi has more practical effects than any Star Wars film, with 180 to 200 creatures created with practical effects, some cut from the final edit.
For Yoda's appearance in the film as a Force ghost, the character was created using puppetry, as was done in the original Star Wars trilogy (as opposed to computer-generated imagery, which was used to create Yoda in most of the prequel trilogy).

===
Music ===
In July 2013, Kennedy confirmed at the Star Wars Celebration Europe that John Williams would return to score the Star Wars sequel trilogy.
Williams confirmed his assignment for The Last Jedi at a Tanglewood concert in August 2016, stating he would begin recording the score "off and on" in December 2016 until March or April 2017.
On February 21, 2017, it was confirmed that recording was underway, with both Williams and William Ross conducting the sessions.
In lieu of a traditional spotting session with Johnson, Williams was provided a temp track of music from his previous film scores as a reference for scoring The Last Jedi.
The official soundtrack album was released by Walt Disney Records on December 15, 2017.

==
Marketing ==
On September 19, 2017, Australia Post released a set of stamp packs.
On October 12, Royal Mail released a set of eight promotional postage stamps designed by Malcolm Tween.
Several tie-in books were released on the same day as the film's release, including The Last Jedi: The Visual Dictionary, and various children's reading and activity books.
Related novelizations included the prequel book Cobalt Squadron, and the Canto Bight, a collection of novellas about the Canto Bight Casino.
As with The Force Awakens, there is no official tie-in game for The Last Jedi, in favor of integrating content from the film into other Star Wars video games, including Star Wars Battlefront II, which introduced various content from the film, during the game's first "season".

Critical response ===
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 90% of 476 reviews are positive, with an average rating of 8.1/10.
The website's critical consensus reads, "
Star Wars:
The Last Jedi honors the saga's rich legacy while adding some surprising twists — and delivering all the emotion-rich action fans could hope for."
According to the review aggregator Metacritic, which sampled 56 reviews and calculated a weighted average of 84 out of 100, The Last Jedi received "universal acclaim".
Metacritic analysis found the film was the 25nd-most mentioned film on "best of the year" film rankings and the 22nd-most mentioned on "best of the decade" film rankings.
Matt Zoller Seitz of RogerEbert.com gave the film four stars out of four, praising the surprises and risks that it took, writing that "The movie works equally well as an earnest adventure full of passionate heroes and villains and a meditation on sequels and franchise properties", in which the film "includes multiple debates over whether one should replicate or reject the stories and symbols of the past.
"
Writing for Rolling Stone, Peter Travers gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, praising the cast and the direction, and the film "ranks with the very best Star Wars epics (even the pinnacle that is The Empire Strikes Back) by pointing the way ahead to a next generation of skywalkers".
Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, praising the action sequences and humor, said that the film "doesn't pack quite the same emotional punch [as The Force Awakens] and it lags a bit in the second half,
[but] this is still a worthy chapter in the Star Wars franchise", and containing a few callbacks of "previous characters and iconic moments.
"Will Gompertz, arts editor of BBC News, gave the film four stars out of five, writing "Rian Johnson [...] has not ruined your Christmas with a turkey.
His gift to you is a cracker, a blockbuster movie packed with invention, wit, and action galore.
"
The unpredictability of the plot was appreciated by reviewers such as Alex Leadbeater of Screen Rant, who commented specifically that the death of Snoke was "the best movie twist in years".
Creator of the franchise George Lucas, who was not involved with the film's production, described The Last Jedi as "beautifully made" shortly after its release.
His reaction to Star Wars:
The Force Awakens was generally more negative.
Conversely, Richard Brody of The New Yorker wrote that the film "comes off as a work that's ironed out, flattened down, appallingly purified."
Kate Taylor of The Globe and Mail gave the film two stars out of four, saying the film suffered from too many new additions, and writing the film that "seeks to uphold a giant cultural legacy, this unfolding trilogy struggles to maintain a balance that often seems just out of reach."
Owen Gleiberman of Variety criticized the film for being too derivative of the past movies by saying that "it's now repeating things that have already been repeated", with such attempts by having a "mood and darkening design of The Empire Strikes Back", making the sequel trilogy becoming "an official monument to nostalgia."
===
Audience reception ===
Audience reception measured by scientific polling methods was highly positive.
Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "A" on an A+ to F scale, and those at PostTrak gave the film an 89% overall positive score, a 79% "definite recommend", and a rare five-star rating.
User-generated scores at Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic were more negative.
At Rotten Tomatoes, 42% of users rated the film 2.6 stars or higher out of 5, while at Metacritic, the average user score is 4.2 out of 10.
Audience scores on such sites require only registration and do not ensure that contributing voters have seen the film.
Several reviewers speculated that coordinated vote brigading from internet groups and bots contributed to the low scores.
Quartz noted that some new accounts gave negative ratings to both The Last Jedi and Thor: Ragnarok (2017), while Bleeding Cool stated that reviews for Thor: Ragnarok had tapered off but then "skyrocketed".
In response to tampering claims shortly after the film's release, a Fandango executive stated that Rotten Tomatoes detected no unusual activity on The Last Jedi aside from a noticeable "uptick in the number of written user reviews".
In 2019, a Rotten Tomatoes spokesperson said the film had been "seriously targeted" by a review-bombing campaign.
Reviewers characterized The Last Jedi as divisive among audiences.
Emily VanDerWerff of Vox found that dissatisfied fans saw the film as too progressive, disliked its humor, plot, or character arcs, or felt betrayed that it ignored fan theories.
Other reviewers made similar observations.
Particularly divisive was the reveal that Rey's parents are insignificant; many fans had expected her to be Luke's daughter or to share a lineage with another character from the original trilogy.
There was also sentiment that Snoke's character was underdeveloped and that Luke's actions contradicted his previous heroic portrayal.
Reviewers stated that fan theories were held so strongly among some viewers that it was difficult for them to accept different stories, but that other viewers appreciated the film's action, tone, and deviation from Star Wars tradition.

Accolades ===

Sequel ==
The Rise of Skywalker, the final installment of the sequel trilogy, was released on December 20, 2019.

Star Wars:
Battlefront is a series of first- and third-person shooter video games based on the Star Wars films.
Players take the role of soldiers in either of two opposing armies in different time periods of the Star Wars universe.

The series was launched in 2004 by LucasArts with Star Wars: Battlefront, developed by Pandemic Studios for LucasArts.
The game received positive reviews and sold well.
In 2005 Pandemic developed a sequel, Star Wars: Battlefront II, which was also critically and commercially successful.
The games were followed by Star Wars Battlefront: Renegade Squadron (2007) and Star Wars Battlefront: Elite Squadron (2009) for handheld consoles and Star Wars Battlefront: Mobile Squadrons for mobile devices.
LucasArts made several attempts to develop a third major Battlefront game but no projects were released before The Walt Disney Company's acquisition of LucasArts.
Subsequently, EA DICE acquired a license to develop a new game, titled Star Wars Battlefront which was released on November 17, 2015.
A sequel, Star Wars Battlefront II, was released on November 17, 2017, and was developed by EA DICE, Criterion Games, and Motive Studios.

==
Gameplay ==
Games in the Battlefront series normally revolve around two armies – the Galactic Republic versus the Confederacy of Independent Systems or the Galactic Empire versus the Rebel Alliance or First Order versus the Resistance – fighting each other on various maps.
Maps take place in the Star Wars galaxy, with battlezones varying in theme and size.
Across the battlefield are multiple "command posts" (objectives) that act as spawn points, and can be controlled by either the player or the computer.

Units can spawn from any friendly command post, and vehicles regularly spawn at their respective command posts when destroyed.
Units can capture neutral or hostile command posts by approaching them and standing within the immediate vicinity for about 30 seconds.
The time to capture quickens with more friendly units within the capture zone.
Some vehicles act as mobile command posts, and must be destroyed as they can not be captured.
On some maps (such as Hoth or Endor), certain structures also act as command posts that can not be captured.
Command post capturing works differently on certain campaign missions as well.

Playable heroes and villains play a significant role in changing the course of battles.

The objective of most matches is to eliminate all of the opponents' reinforcement tickets or to capture the command points, to slowly chip away at their tickets.
Reinforcement tickets are used whenever a unit is killed, or when one faction controls a majority of the command posts on the map (usually when the losing faction only has 2-3).
Only one objective needs to be completed.
When all command posts are captured, the team with no command posts has twenty seconds to recapture or neutralize an enemy command post.
If the team cannot take over a post in this time, the match is over.
Certain campaign levels and multiplayer have requirements that differ from the general game play, however the general structure remains the same.
The game's "Conquest" mode is vaguely based on the Battlefield game mode of the same name.

===
Playable characters ===
Numerous characters from the movies, TV series and other games have been available to play as, which include:


==
Development ==
The first console games of the series were developed by Pandemic Studios, and since 2015, a second series of console Battlefront games has been developed by EA DICE.
Battlefront II (2017) is the first in the series to accurately follow the canon of the films, while the games developed by Pandemic Studios were relegated to Star Wars Legends non-canonical status, along with all of the games in the series released before November 2015.

Star Wars: Battlefront (Pandemic Studios) ==


===
Star Wars: Battlefront ===
Star Wars:
Battlefront is the first installment in the Battlefront series.
It was released on September 21, 2004, with a Mac port by Aspyr released in July 2005.
The game is available on Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 2, Xbox, Mac OS, and mobile phones.
Jedi are not playable in this game without the help of modified files unsupported by LucasArts.
Other NPCs made playable by similar files include, but are not limited to, Tusken Raiders in the Dune Sea of Tatooine, Ewoks of Endor and Gungans on the Naboo plains.

===
Star Wars: Battlefront II ===
Star Wars:
Battlefront II is the second installment in the Battlefront series, released in Europe on October 31, 2005 – for the PlayStation 2, PSP, Xbox, and Windows – and in North America one day later.
There are some significant differences between Battlefront and Battlefront II.
Battlefront II includes playable Jedi characters, space battles, and story campaigns, as well as Star Wars:
Episode III – Revenge of the Sith-related content.
The release date of Battlefront II coincided with the release of Revenge of the Sith on DVD.

The game is now an Xbox Platinum Hits game, a Sony Greatest Hits game in North America, and an Xbox Classics and PlayStation Platinum game in Europe.

Battlefront II expands upon the original game's single-player experience with mission-based objectives drawn from the first six Star Wars films.
It has a story-based campaign which revolves around the 501st Legion (AKA "Vader's Fist") and its evolution from a legion of clone troopers serving the Republic during the Clone Wars to Imperial stormtroopers.
Many maps from Star Wars Battlefront make a second appearance, and the game adds new locales such as Coruscant and Utapau.
The game also introduces "heroes" – playable characters based on iconic characters from the Star Wars films who are much more powerful than regular soldier (and were also present in the original Battlefront, but only as NPCs that spawned randomly on the battlefield); the hero roster includes Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Leia Organa, Chewbacca, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Yoda, Mace Windu, Ki-Adi Mundi and Aayla Secura (as well as Kit Fisto, available only on the Xbox version of the game via the Xbox Live patch), whereas the villain roster includes Darth Vader, Darth Sidious, Boba Fett, Count Dooku, General Grievous, Darth Maul, Jango Fett, and Anakin Skywalker (as well as Asajj Ventress, also available only via the Xbox Live patch).
There are more modes in this game, such as Conquest, Hunt (where players fight as natives on planets against other natives or certain troopers in an army, such as Wampas vs. Rebels on Hoth or Tusken Raiders vs. Jawas on Tatooine, to earn 50 points first), Capture the Flag (both with 1 and 2 flags), Assault (which, on Tatooine only, is also available as Heroes vs Villains, where one team plays as the heroes and the other one as the villains in a race to rack up points by defeating enemies) and space battles.

Star Wars: Battlefront III ====
On September 29, 2006, Computer and Video Games made an unconfirmed claim that Free Radical Design was developing the third game in the Star Wars: Battlefront series, titled Star Wars: Battlefront III.
In June 2008, Kotaku allegedly received information from a former LucasArts employee that Star Wars:
Battlefront III was in the creation process.
On October 2,  Activision Blizzard filed a classification with the Australian Office of Film and Literature Classification listing Star Wars: Battlefront III for the Nintendo DS with a PG rating (E10+ equivalent) for mild animated violence.
However, that same month, Free Radical Design announced that they lost the rights to develop Star Wars: Battlefront III; the game at that point had been in development for two years.
Several years later, Free Radical Design co-founder Steve Ellis said Battlefront III was "pretty much done" in 2008, but that it was effectively canned when LucasArts could not commit to "spend big" on marketing it.
However, GameSpot quoted an unnamed LucasArts employee involved with the project who said Free Radical could not devote sufficient resources to the game and regularly missed deadlines.
A former Free Radical Design employee said some of the technology Free Radical developed for the game, specifically the contiguous game environment from planet surface into space, "is dying with us".
During and after the game's development, screenshots, and gameplay footage became accessible to the public.
In December 2008, Star Wars character renders bearing a Battlefront III watermark surfaced from a laid-off Free Radical employee.
The following month, gameplay footage was leaked from a November 2008 Free Radical in-house showing of Battlefront III footage.
The footage was pulled from IGN after LucasArts demanded its removal.
On April 1, 2012, a user on the game journalist website Betagames discovered Star Wars models and textures buried in Resident Evil:
Operation Raccoon City's archives; PC Gamer's Tom Senior speculated that these could have been from Battlefront III.
Also in April 2012, Past to Present revealed pre-alpha footage of Free Radical Design's Battlefront III.
YouTube videos showing the game's rough state received media attention from outlets such as Joystiq, Kotaku, and Shacknews.
On January 20, 2016, a leaked build of the game surfaced on Reddit.
It is currently playable using an Xbox 360 Development Kits and modified Xbox 360 consoles via a program called "RGLoader".

Star Wars:

Online ====
Star Wars:
Battlefront Online was rumored to be the next installment in the series.
On January 28, 2010, Kotaku reported that SOCOM developer Slant Six Games was working with LucasArts to develop an online-only Battlefront title due in 2011.
The game was said to be released for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.
It was also stated that this game may have been the source of the Star Wars: Battlefront 3 concept art renders.
However, the game has been canceled after the studio was unable to meet its 2010 release deadline.

====
Star Wars:
First Assault and Version Two ====
Star Wars:
First Assault was to be a downloadable multiplayer shooter for Xbox Live Arcade.
Digital Trends speculated that Star Wars: First Assault might help LucasArts recover some of their previous investment in Battlefront III and other projects in the franchise.

Speaking to Kotaku an anonymous insider noted that the game was to be "step zero" towards a third Battlefront game.

When footage of the game was leaked onto YouTube Tech site TechnoBuffalo noted that the gameplay very closely resembled that of the Call of Duty franchise.
Alongside First Assault, LucasArts was also working on a separate game titled "Version 2", which was, reportedly, a code name for Battlefront 3.
====
Star Wars Battlefront IV ====
In 2018, concept art surfaced of a canceled Battlefront IV, rather than attempting to fit within the previous games and films' continuity, concept art showed the game was meant to focus on an alternate reality where Obi-Wan Kenobi and Luke Skywalker fell to the dark side, instead of Anakin Skywalker.

=== Handheld and mobile only games ===


====
Star Wars Battlefront:
Renegade Squadron ====
Star Wars Battlefront:
Renegade Squadron is a handheld game released in North America on October 9, 2007 and in Europe three days later.
The game was released only for the PlayStation Portable.
Renegade Squadron is also available in a bundle pack with the then-new white PSP redesign featuring Darth Vader on the back.

Aside from new heroes and vehicles, such as the Millennium Falcon, a new feature is the ability to create a character, allowing the player to adjust the character's features such as weapon, appearance, and speed.
However, the character will be vulnerable due to the lacking of certain aspects that will be replaced by others.
For example, the character may be fast but weak or have good weapons but no stamina and speed.
Before the game's release, LucasArts had stated that over one million different customizable options would be present.
Another new feature allows players to enter asteroid bases on some space maps.

Commander Col Serra describes the forming of Renegade Squadron in the beginning cutscene of campaign.
Then the player starts a series of missions ranging in objectives while including cut scenes between each mission.
The final mission includes the Battle of Endor, in which the objectives are similar to the footage of Return of the Jedi.

====
Star Wars Battlefront:
Elite Squadron ====
Star Wars Battlefront:
Elite Squadron was released on November 3, 2009 for the PlayStation Portable and the Nintendo DS.
This marks the third Battlefront game on the PlayStation Portable and the first on a Nintendo console.
The game was originally discovered through its ESRB rating on the official ESRB website which has since been taken down.
It follows in the same vein as its predecessors with space, land and new air battles.
Elite Squadron is most notable for featuring simultaneous space and ground battles in Instant Action, and is the only game in the series with this feature.
Players usually play in a third person perspective, but in the PSP version, they can also switch to a strategy based mode where they may build troops and upgrade armies.
====
Star Wars Battlefront:
Mobile Squadrons ====
Star Wars Battlefront:
Mobile Squadrons is a mobile game developed by THQ Wireless.
It was released on April 2, 2009.
The game features a persistent online community, and has three character classes.
The gameplay is a first person perspective shooter that can use the touch features of a phone, although the player has no control over movement.

Star Wars Battlefront (2015) ===
At an Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) press conference on June 10, 2013, EA DICE (whose parent company, Electronic Arts, had recently acquired a multi-year license to produce Star Wars video games), unveiled a teaser trailer for a new Star Wars: Battlefront game, built on the Frostbite 3 engine.
The teaser showed a first-person view of the Battle of Hoth, including a crashing Snowspeeder and the foot of an AT-AT.
DICE showed additional development footage at the 2014 E3 conference.
The game's title was eventually announced as Star Wars Battlefront.
In April 2015, EA announced a release date of November 17, 2015  at Star Wars Celebration.
The game is a reboot of the series, focusing on capturing the look of the films.
At launch, four planets were confirmed - Hoth, Tatooine, Endor, and Sullust.
Unlike its predecessors, Star Wars Battlefront does not feature the Clone Wars era found in the prequel films, nor does it feature content from The Force Awakens; as a result, the hero and villain roster is also limited, at launch including only Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Leia Organa, Darth Vader, Emperor Palpatine, and Boba Fett.
Free downloadable content (DLC) for the game was released in December 2015, featuring the planet of Jakku with two new maps and a new multiplayer game mode.
The game also features both first and third-person gameplay perspectives, similar to its predecessors.
A gameplay trailer involving the Hoth battle debuted at E3 on June 15, 2015.
The game features a pseudo-campaign — a cooperative experience allowing the player to experience gameplay with one or two players and computer-controlled allies and opponents.

"Outer Rim" is the first DLC pack for the game and was released on March 22, 2016.
It adds new heroes Nien Nunb and Greedo to the game, four new maps set in Jabba the Hutt's Palace (Palace Garage and Jabba's Palace) on Tatooine and a factory area on Sullust (Sorosuub Refinery and Sorosuub Pipelines), and a new mode called "Extraction".
The DLC is available for free to all players who have purchased the game's Season Pass, otherwise costing $10.
The second expansion pack is titled "Bespin" and allows players to fight in the setting of Cloud City, released in September 2016.
The expansion added more maps along with an additional game mode titled sabotage and new heroes Lando Calrissian and Dengar.
The third expansion pack, titled "Death Star", was released in September 2016 as well and added the long-awaited Death Star to the game, along with new heroes Chewbacca and Bossk.

The fourth and final DLC pack was released on December 6, 2016.
It is based on characters and locations from the film Rogue One, and includes Jyn Erso and Orson Krennic as new playable heroes, and a new game mode set both above and on the planet Scarif.

Star Wars Battlefront II
(2017) ===
Blake Jorgensen of Electronic Arts mentioned a sequel in November 2016, and Star Wars Battlefront II was announced in March 2017.
The game was released on November 17, 2017.
Since the restructuring of the Star Wars canon, Battlefront is the first game with a storyline that is considered canonical to the film series.

Star Wars Battlefront II features both single-player and multiplayer game modes, a customizable character class system, and content based on all Star Wars movies up to Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker (with content for the other movies, as well as television series being added later on via free DLC).
A Celebration Edition was released in December 2019.
DICE announced that Scarif from Rogue One would be the last content update released for the game.

=== Canceled spin-off ===
In 2019, EA was in the process of developing a game code-named Viking, designed as a spin-off of the Battlefront series with open-world elements.
The game was originally planned for release in fall 2020, coinciding with the next generation of video game consoles, but was canceled in late 2019.

Galaxy in Turmoil ====
On January 25, 2016, Frontwire Studios began an attempt to produce an unofficial Battlefront installment called Galaxy in Turmoil.
The fan made game was in production using Unreal Engine 4 and was based on the canceled Star Wars: Battlefront III by Free Radical Design.
Although early versions of the game contained assets from  Free Radical Design, they soon became "place holders" as the full game planned to be released using assets and music made from the ground up.
On June 4, 2016, Galaxy in Turmoil gained a distribution deal through Valve and was planned to be released for free on Steam which generated a fair amount of attention.
On June 22, 2016, Lucasfilm requested the production of Galaxy in Turmoil be halted.

On July 31, 2016, Frontwire Studios announced the cancellation of the game was due to the "possibility of Galaxy in Turmoil taking away attention from Electronic Arts's Battlefront franchise".
Proposals of Galaxy in Turmoil falling under the paywall of Electronic Arts, and ideas of Lucasfilm giving Frontwire Studios a Star Wars license were both rejected due to an agreement between Electronic Arts and Lucasfilm.
Although Frontwire Studios may have fallen within Fair Use laws, legal conflict was avoided and the project was canceled.
There is a playable alpha that contains assets from Free Radical Design that was released to the public then removed early within Galaxy in Turmoil's lifetime.
Galaxy in Turmoil is now planned to be redeveloped as a brand new cyberpunk-themed IP without any Star Wars references, but still with Battlefront III-inspired mechanics including space-to-ground battles.
