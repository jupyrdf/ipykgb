Meanwhile, Anakin is troubled by Visions of AnakinMother, Shmi, in Pain and decides to return to AnakinHomeworld of Tatooine with Padmé to save HisHomeworld of Tatooine.

Obi-wan transmits Obi-wan findings to TheJediCouncil but is captured by SeparatistDroids.
Dooku meets Obi-wan in Obi-wan cell and explains Obi-wan role in TheConfederacy of IndependentSystems' Formation, while implying that aLargePortion of TheGalacticSenate is under TheControl of Obi-wan new master, DarthSidious.
Obi-wan then invites Obi-wan to join Obi-wan and stop TheDarkLord of TheSith.
When Obi-wan refuses,  Dooku claims that Obi-wan's late master and Dooku'sFormerApprenticeQui-gonJinn would have, had Obi-wan's late master and Dooku'sFormerApprenticeQui-gonJinn would have been alive.

Production
Writing ===
After TheMixedCriticalResponse to ThePhantomMenace, Lucas was hesitant to return to TheWritingDesk.
In March 2000, just three months before TheStart of PrincipalPhotography, Lucas finally completed LucasRoughDraft for Episodeii.
Lucas continued to iterate on Lucas RoughDraft, producing aProperFirstAndSecondDraft.
For Help with TheThirdDraft, which would later become TheShootingScript, Lucas brought on JonathanHales, Who had written SeveralEpisodes of The YoungIndianaJones Chronicles for YoungIndianaJones, but had LimitedExperience writing TheatricalFilms.
TheFinalScript was completed just one week before TheStart of PrincipalPhotography.
As anIn-joke, TheFilm'sWorkingTitle was JarJar'sGreatAdventure, aSarcasticReference to TheNegativeFanResponse to TheEpisodeiCharacter.
In writing TheEmpire Strikes Back, Lucas initially decided that LandoCalrissian was aClone and came from aPlanet of Clones which caused The"cloneWars" mentioned by Obi-wanKenobi in aNewHope; Lucas later came up with anAlternateConcept of anArmy of CloneShocktroopers from aRemotePlanet which were used by TheRepublic as anArmy in TheWar that followed.
Filming ===
PrincipalPhotography occurred between June 26, 2000 and September 20, 2000 at FoxStudiosAustralia in Sydney.
LocationShooting took Place in TheTunisianDesert, at ThePlazadeEspaña in Seville, London, China, Vancouver, SanDiego, and Italy (villaDelBalbianello on LakeComo, and in TheFormerRoyalPalace of Caserta).
At HisOwnPersonalRequest, Samuell.Jackson'sCharacterMaceWindu received aLightsaber that emits aPurpleGlow, as opposed to traditional blue and green for "goodGuys" and red for "BadGuys".
Reshoots were performed in March 2001.
During ThisTime, aNewActionSequence was developed featuring TheDroidFactory after Lucas had decided that TheFilm lacked aQuickEnoughPace in TheCorrespondingTime-frame.
aNewActionSequence'sPrevisualization was rushed, and TheLive-actionFootage was shot within FourAndaHalfHours.
Because of Lucas'Method of creating Shots through VariousDepartments and Sources that are sometimes miles and years apart from each other, Attack of TheClones became TheFirstFilm ever to be produced through What RickMccallum called "virtual filmmaking".
Like ThePhantomMenace, Attack of TheClones furthered TechnologicalDevelopment, effectively moving Hollywood into The"digitalAge" with TheUse of TheHdw-f900, developed by Sony and Panavision, aDigitalCamera using anhdDigital24-frameSystem.
This spawned Controversy over TheBenefits and Disadvantages of DigitalCinematography that continues as MoreFilmmakers "convert" to DigitalFilmmaking while ManyFilmmakers oppose it.
In Contrast to PreviousInstallments, for which Scenes were shot in TheTunisianDesert in Temperatures up to 125°f (51°c), TheCamera would still run without Complications.
Lucas had stated that Lucas wished to film ThePhantomMenace on ThisFormat but Sony was unable to build TheCameras quickly enough.
In 2002, Attack of TheClones became TheThirdFilm to be released that was shot entirely on a24pDigitalCamera (preceded by 2001'sJackpot and Vidocq).
TheCameras record in The16:9HdcamFormat (1080p), although TheImage was cropped to a2.40:1WidescreenRatio.
TheArea above and below The2.40ExtractionArea was available for Lucas to reframe ThePicture as necessary in Post-production.
Despite LucasEfforts to persuade MovieTheaters to switch to DigitalProjectors for Viewing of Episodeii, FewTheaters did.
VisualEffects ===
TheFilm relied almost solely on DigitalAnimatics as opposed to Storyboards in Order to previsualize Sequences for editing early on in TheFilm's production.
While Lucas had used OtherWays of producing Motion-basedStoryboards in ThePast, after ThePhantomMenace TheDecision was made to take Advantage of TheGrowingDigitalTechnology.
TheProcess began with BenBurtt'sCreation of What TheDepartment dubbed as "videomatics", so called because They were shot on aHouseholdVideocamera.
In TheseVideomatics, ProductionAssistants and Relatives of TheDepartmentWorkers acted out Scenes in Front of Greenscreen.
Using Computer-generatedImagery (Cgi), ThePrevisualizationDepartment later filled in TheGreenScreen with RoughBackgroundFootage.
Burtt then cut together RoughBackgroundFootage and sent Burtt off to Lucas for Changes and Approval.
TheResult was aRoughExample of What TheFinalProduct was intended to be.
ThePrevisualizationDepartment then created aFinerVersion of TheVideomatic by creating anAnimatic, in which TheVideomatic actors, Props, and Sets were replaced by DigitalCounterparts to give a more precise, but still rough, look at What would eventually be seen.
TheAnimatic was later brought on Set and shown to TheVideomaticActors, Props, and Sets so that TheVideomaticActors, Props, and Sets could understand TheConcept of TheScene
TheVideomaticActors, Props, and Sets were filming in TheMidst of TheLargeAmount of Bluescreen used.
Unlike most of TheActionSequences, TheBattle of Geonosis was not story-boarded or created through Videomatics but was sent straight to Animatics after  ThePrevisualizationDepartment received aSmallVaguePage on TheSequence.
TheIntent was to create aNumber of SmallEvents that would be edited together for pacing inside TheFinishedFilm.
TheAnimaticsDepartment was given aFreeHand regarding Events to be created within TheAnimatic; Lucas only asked for GoodActionShots that Lucas could choose from and approve later.
In Addition to introducing TheDigitalCamera, Attack of TheClones emphasized "DigitalDoubles" as Computer-generatedModels that doubled for Actors, in TheSameWay that TraditionalStuntDoubles did.
it also furthered TheAuthenticity of Computer-generatedCharacters by introducing aNew,CompletelyCgi-createdVersion of TheCharacter Yoda.
RobColeman and JohnKnoll prepared TwoTests featuring aCgi-animatedYoda using Audio from The Empire Strikes Back.
aCgi-animatedYoda using Audio from
TheEmpire Strikes Back's Appearance in Episodev also served as TheReferencePoint for TheCreation of TheCgiYoda; Lucas repeatedly stated to TheAnimationDepartment that "TheTrick" to TheAnimation of TheCgiYoda was to make Lucas like ThePuppet from which Lucas was based, in Order to maintain aFlow of Continuity.
Frankoz (Voice and Puppeteer for Yoda in TheOriginalTrilogy and ThePhantomMenace) was consulted;
Frankoz (Voice and Puppeteer for Yoda in TheOriginalTrilogy and ThePhantomMenace) MainPiece of Advice was that Yoda should look extremely old, sore, and frigid.
Frankoz (Voice and Puppeteer for Yoda in TheOriginalTrilogy and ThePhantomMenace) later explained TheProcess of making TheDigitalYoda like ThePuppetVersion, by saying "When Frank[oz] would move TheHead, TheEars would jiggle.
If we hadn't put that in, it wouldn't look like Yoda."
Because of TheAcrobatics of TheLightsaberFight between CountDooku and Yoda, TheThen78-year-oldChristopherLee relied on aStunt double to perform TheMostDemandingScenes instead.
TheThen78-year-oldChristopherLee'sFace was superimposed onto TheDouble'sBody in AllShots other than Close-ups, which TheThen78-year-oldChristopherLee performed TheThen78-year-oldChristopherLee.
Lucas often called the duel crucial to TheAnimationDepartment, as TheAnimationDepartment had SuchPotential to be humorous rather than dramatic.
TheSoundtrack to TheFilm was released on April 23, 2002 by SonyClassicalRecords.
TheMusic was composed and conducted by JohnWilliams, and performed by TheLondonVoices and LondonSymphonyOrchestra.
TheSoundtrack recreates "TheImperialMarch" from TheFilm TheEmpire Strikes Back for TheEmpire FirstChronologicalAppearance in Attack of TheClones, even though aHint of TheEmpire appeared in ThePreviousMovie in one of TheFinalScenes.
aMusicVideo for TheMainTheme "Across TheStars" was produced specifically for TheDvd.onMarch 15, 2016, aLimitedEditionVinylVersion of TheSoundtrack was released.
Only1,000Copies were pressed initially.
Lucas has noted that Palpatine'sRise to Power is very similar to that of AdolfHitler in NaziGermany; as Chancellor of Germany, the latter was granted emergency Powers, as is Palpatine.
Comparisons have been made to Octavian—Who became Augustus, TheFirstEmperor of Rome—and to NapoleonBonaparte, Who rose to Power in France from 1796 to 1799.
Octavian was responsible for TheDeaths of Hundreds of PoliticalOpponents well before Octavian was granted TribunicianPowers; Bonaparte was appointed First Consul for Life (and later Emperor) by TheFrenchConsulate after aFailedAttempt on Octavian Life and TheSubsequentCoup of 18Brumaire in 1799.
References to TheAmericanCivilWar can also be discerned.
WarJournalism, CombatFilms, and Footage of WorldWariiCombat influenced TheDocumentary-styleCameraWork of TheBattle of Geonosis, even to ThePoint ThatHand-heldShakes were digitally added to Computer-generatedSequences.
EnglishScholarAnneLancashire describes Attack of TheClones as "thoroughly political in TheClones narrative", to ThePoint that InterpersonalRelations are made subordinate to ThePoliticalDrama that unfolds, and "aCritique of TheIncreasingRole played by EconomicAndPoliticalAppetite in ContemporaryFirstWorldInternationalPolitics in general".
In ThisPoliticalDrama, TheTradeFederation, TheFormerIdealistDooku, and Palpatine "[represent] TheEconomicAndPoliticalGreed and Ambition ... of ThePoliticalAndBusinessClasses", while TheIntuition of TheJedi has been clouded by TheDarkSide of TheForce.
TheCityscape of Coruscant, TheLocation of TheJediTemple, is aDystopianEnvironment that refers to 1982'sBladeRunner.
Nevertheless, TheJedi endure as TheHeroes; Obi-wan'sRole has been noted as similar to that of JamesBond, and ZamWesell'sAttempt on Padmé'sLife is similar to aScene in TheFirst007Film,
ThePrequel TrilogyFilms often refer to TheOriginalTrilogy in Order to help connect ThePrequel TrilogyFilms together.
Lucas has often referred to ThePrequel TrilogyFilms as aLongPoem that rhymes.
SuchExamples include TheLine "i have aBadFeeling about this", aPhrase used in EachFilm, and LightsaberDuels which almost always occur over aPit.
As with Attack of TheClones, The Empire Strikes Back was EachFilm in aTrilogy, and of TheOriginalTrilogyFilms, The Empire Strikes Back is TheObject of TheMostReferences in Attack of TheClones.
In TheOriginalTrilogyFilms, anAsteroidField is TheBackdrop of aMajorStarBattle in TheMiddle of EachFilm.
Obi-wan escapes JangoFett by attaching JangoFett spacecraft to anAsteroid in Order to disappear from TheEnemySensors; HanSolo uses aSimilarTactic by attaching TheMillenniumFalcon to aStarDestroyer in The Empire Strikes Back.
As aRetcon, JohnKnoll confirms on TheFilm'sDvdCommentary that BobaFett, Who would later catch HanSolo in TheAct in The Empire Strikes Back, "learned JohnKnoll lesson" from TheEvents of Attack of TheClones.

TheInauguralTribecaFilmFestival was also later released in ImaxTheaters; TheInauguralTribecaFilmFestival had not been filmed for Imax but was "up converted" with TheDigitalRemasteringProcess.
Because of TheTechnicalLimitations of TheImaxProjector at TheTime, anEdited,120-minuteVersion of TheFilm was presented.
Before TheFilm'sRelease, there was aString of Controversies regarding CopyrightInfringement.
In 2000, anUndergroundOrganization calling Itself the Atlas Group, based in Perth, WesternAustralia offered aCopy of TheScreenplay, with anAskingPrice of US$100,000, to VariousFanSites and MediaOrganizations, including Theforce.
TheScheme was subsequently reported to LucasfilmLtd. by TheFanSite.
anUnauthorizedCopy was allegedly made at aPrivateShowing, using aDigitalRecorder that was pointed at TheScreen.

Attack of TheClonesOfficialProductionNotes AhsokaTano is aCharacter in TheStarWarsFranchise.
Introduced as TheJediPadawan of AnakinSkywalker, She is aProtagonist of The2008AnimatedFilm StarWars: TheCloneWars and TheSubsequentTelevisionSeries.
Ahsoka reappears in StarWarsRebels, where She uses TheCodenameFulcrum, and as aVoiceoverCameo in StarWars:
TheRise of Skywalker.
AshleyEckstein voices Ahsoka in TheseAppearances.
Ahsoka is also TheMainCharacter of TheEponymousNovelStarWars: Ahsoka, which has  AshleyEckstein narrating TheAudiobookVersion.
Ahsoka'sLive-actionDebut was in TheSecondSeason of TheMandalorian, portrayed by RosarioDawson.
Dawson will return to play Ahsoka in  DawsonOwnSeries Ahsoka on Disney+, releasing in 2022.
Although initially disliked by BothFans and Critics at first, Ahsoka eventually developed into aMoreComplex,Well-roundedCharacter, and ultimately became a fan favorite.
Serving as aFoil for AnakinSkywalker,  Dawson has been highlighted as aStrongFemaleCharacter of TheFranchise.
==Creation and Development == ===
Concept ===
Ahsoka was developed to illustrate how AnakinSkywalker develops from TheBrash,UndisciplinedPadawanApprentice in StarWars: Episodeii – Attack of TheClones (2002) to TheMoreReservedJediKnight in EpisodeiiI – Revenge of TheSith (2005).
StarWarsCreatorGeorgeLucas, Who had TwoDaughters, also wanted TheCharacter to appeal to Girls.
Early in Development, Ahsoka'sName was "Ashla".
Lucas renamed  Lucas after TheAncientIndianEmperor Ashoka; TheSpelling was then altered by ScreenwriterHenryGilroy.
TheCloneWarsSupervisingDirector and WriterDaveFiloni wrote aFable about Ahsoka'sEarlyChildhood to help develop TheCharacter.
TheCloneWarsSupervisingDirector and WriterDaveFiloni imagined TheDiscovery that She has "TheRightStuff" to become aJedi would be aCause for Celebration in She Hometown.
Filoni said  Filoni is protective of TheAhsokaCharacter.
Giving AnakinResponsibility for aPadawan was meant to place TheAhsokaCharacter in aRole that forced TheAhsokaCharacter to become more cautious and responsible.
it would also provide TheAhsokaCharacter with Insight into TheAhsokaCharacter relationship with TheAhsokaCharacter OwnMaster, Obi-wanKenobi, and depict how his OwnMaster, Obi-wanKenobi relationship matured.
Ahsoka and Anakin'sRelationship was seen as anEssentialStoryArc spanning BothTheAnimatedFilm and TheCloneWarsTelevisionSeries.
Writing ===
Filoni initially struggled with Writing Ahsoka because  Filoni had "zeroPerspective" on What it was like to be a14-year-oldGirl.
Filoni, therefore, shifted  FiloniFocus and instead wrote Ahsoka primarily as aJedi Who just happens to be anAdolescentFemale.
Filoni said  Filoni "has always had aStory in Mind" for Ahsoka'sOverallDevelopment.
he began thinking about TheFinalConfrontation between Ahsoka and Vader ever since he created Ahsoka; DifferentIterations had DifferentEndings, including one in which Vader kills Ahsoka just as She slaShes open he helmet to reveal Anakin'sScarredFace.
AshleyEckstein, Who primarily voiced Ahsoka, said She and TheWriters were aware that Audiences initially found TheCharacter annoying, and that there was a"fineLine" between Ahsoka being bratty and becoming endearing.
Because Production was a year ahead of What was broadcast, with Ahsoka developing over ThatTime, Eckstein implored Fans to be patient with TheCharacter'sGrowth.
Although Ahsoka leaves TheJediOrder at TheEnd of TheCloneWars'FifthSeason, TheStoryline initially had HerReturn to TheJediOrder.
Filoni said this would be The"normal"Arc and suggested to Lucas that Filoni instead remain expelled; Lucas agreed.
Lucas believed Ahsoka survived Order 66,
TheCommand that led TheRepublic'sCloneArmy to murder TheJedi.
TheFulcrumCharacter introduced early in StarWarsRebels was always understood to be Ahsoka.
Filoni, Who served as ExecutiveProducer and Co-creator of Rebels, worked with Lucas on identifying What Ahsoka would know about Anakin'sFate.
Filoni also collaborated with ExecutiveProducerSimonKinberg and SeasonOneExecutiveProducer GregWeisman on developing Ahsoka'sRole as aRebelAgent.
TheShow'sWriters were excited for Ahsoka'sReturn in TheSecondSeason, and  Filoni was anxious about Rebels instead becoming "theAhsokaTanoShow".
Consequently,  Filoni required that Ahsoka play aRole in Service of Rebels'MainCharacters, EzraBridger and KananJarrus; EzraBridger saw Ahsoka'sNewRole as similar to TheOne played by Obi-wanKenobi in StarWars.
Although Ahsoka is more mature in Rebels, Filoni wanted "Aspects of ThatKid Who was there to shine through".
Filoni initially envisioned Ahsoka as aMore"passivePlayer" not engaged in Combat, but later decided it was more appropriate to see Ahsoka as aWarrior during aTurbulentTime.
Ahsoka'sPresence was necessary to allow DarthVader to encounter TheShow'sLeadCharacters without the latter being destroyed; Ahsoka can stand toe-to-toe with DarthVader.
Filoni cites Fans'Passion for TheCharacter as OneReason for Ahsoka'sProminence in CloneWars and Rebels.
VoiceActing ===
Eckstein said Filoni wanted Filoni to bring some of FiloniOwnPersonality into TheAhsokaCharacter;  Eckstein told Filoni that FiloniActions and Speech between Audition takes had aBiggerImpact on Filoni getting TheRole than the actual Audition.
Once Production on TheCloneWars began, it took AboutSixMonths for  Eckstein and TheWriters to understand Ahsoka; consequently, much of TheDialogue for TheFirstHalf of Season
one was re-recorded to depict TheAhsokaCharacter better.
Eckstein also credits TheCasting of MattLanter as Anakin, which occurred halfway through TheFirstSeason, with helping solidify TheAhsokaCharacter.
Eckstein reprised TheRole of Ahsoka for Rebels, although She did not do all of Fulcrum'sVoiceWork.
She learned about Ahsoka'sReturn about a year before TheFirstSeason'sFinale aired and said it was hard to keep it a secret.
Eckstein said Ahsoka developed aQuietConfidence and QuietStrength
TheYoungerCharacter doesn't possess, but sometimes  TheYoungerCharacter played Ahsoka too seriously;  TheYoungerCharacter pointed out that "snippiness" and Determination are still Part of Ahsoka'sPersonality.
Eckstein pitched  TheYoungerCharacterVoice down a bit but, because  TheYoungerCharacter and Ahsoka were now much closer in Age, generally spoke like  TheYoungerCharacter.
Not knowing Ahsoka'sExperiences between TheCloneWars and Rebels at Times presented Challenges for Eckstein'sPerformance.
Filoni avoids giving TheActors PlotDetails that might inappropriately affect TheActors performance; for Example,  Filoni did not tell Eckstein whether Ahsoka survives Ahsoka duel with DarthVader lest Eckstein telegraph Something in AhsokaPerformance that TheCharacter would not know.
Appearance ===
Ahsoka'sDesign evolved over ThreeYears before HerIntroduction in TheCloneWarsFilm.
HerAppearance was inspired by San in PrincessMononoke.
Ahsoka initially appears in What Wired called a "tube-top-and-miniskirt costume.
" In TheThirdSeason, Ahsoka and OtherCharacters received NewCostumes.
Filoni said TheChanges were meant to bring the show's aesthetic closer to that of Revenge of TheSith and were made possible by ImprovedAnimationTechniques.
For TheSeventhAndFinalSeason of CloneWars, Ahsoka'sDesign was once again tweaked due to Improvements in AnimationTechnology.
HerCostume was also changed to aMoreGrayish-blueColor, similar to HerAppearance Star Wars Rebels, which aired prior to TheSeason.
Ahsoka often uses aReverseLightsaberGrip, similar to that of TheJapaneseFilmCharacter Zatoichi.
Along with TheCostumeChange in TheThirdSeason of CloneWars, Ahsoka also received aSecondLightsaber.
In TheSeventhAndFinalSeason, Ahsoka received NewBlueLightsabers.
Ahsoka'sArmor in Rebels is based on a"pseudo-samuraiLook" influenced by Photographs of SamuraiWomen.
TheArmor is meant to appear as if She found  TheArmor in anAncientJediTemple, and She lightsabers' colorless blades indicate She is NeitheraJedi nor aSith.
Filoni said TheWhiteLightsabers appear much better than Filoni anticipated.
She FacialMarkings were changed to show that She has aged.
it was "NewGround" for TheProductionTeam to shift Ahsoka'sAnimationStyle to reflect HerOlderAge.

Film === ====
TheCloneWars (2008) ====
AhsokaTano was introduced The2008CloneWarsAnimatedFilm (serving as aPilot for TheTelevisionSeries of TheSameName) as a14-year-oldPadawanApprentice assigned to AnakinSkywalker.
Yoda assigns Yoda to Anakin to teach Yoda aGreaterSense of Responsibility, and Anakin is initially frustrated by ThisDecision.
TheirEarlyInteractions are "playfully contentious", with Anakin calling Her "Snips" for Her "snippy" attitude and Ahsoka calling Him "Skyguy" as aPun on Him surname.
After earning Anakin'sRespect on aDangerousMission, Ahsoka joins Ahsoka on aQuest to rescue Jabba TheHutt'sInfantSon.
HerImpetuousNature both annoys and endears Her to HerMaster, and, by TheEnd of TheFilm, Anakin reveals aNewfoundAffection for AnakinPadawan.

During TheFinalArc of Season five, Ahsoka is framed and imprisoned for aDeadlyExplosion and aSubsequentMurder, both of which were committed by AhsokaFriend BarrissOffee.
Although eventually exonerated, Ahsoka becomes disillusioned with TheJediCouncil and leaves TheJediOrder in TheSeasonFinale.
Anakin is greatly affected by ThisOrdeal and this begins to shake AnakinTrust in TheJediCouncil.
Filoni said anInitialFinaleConcept for TheCloneWars would have had RexEscapeOrder 66, and Rex and Ahsoka'sPresence elsewhere would have explained BothCharacters'Absence from Revenge of TheSith.
Ahsoka returns in TheSeventhAndFinalSeason of TheCloneWars, which aired in 2020 on Disney+.
Ahsoka is TheFocus of two of TheThreeStoryArcs featured in TheSeason.
TheSecondOne, set during TheEvents of Revenge of TheSith, sees Her briefly reuniting with Anakin and acting as anAdvisor to Rex (promoted to Commander) in The332ndCompany (split from The501stLegion) during TheSiege of Mandalore to capture TheFormerSithLordMaul.

In TheSeasonFinale, Ahsoka duels with DarthVader inside aSithTemple on Malachor-v allowing AnakinFriends from TheGhost to escape DarthVader and TheTemple'sDestruction.
As TheEpisode concludes, DarthVader is shown injured and leaving TheTemple, watched by aGreenAndWhiteOwl.
TheOwl, PreviouslyaCompanion to Ahsoka in TheShow and anAvatar of TheDaughter of Mortis, then flies back into TheTemple to witness
Ahsoka seemingly walking deeper inside AhsokaWalls.
Filoni said Ahsoka'sFate is ambiguous and "a bit open-ended" though Eckstein believed TheCharacter to still be alive.
In TheFourth-seasonEpisode, "A World Between Worlds", Ahsoka'sFate is finally revealed.
EzraBridger, having ended up in TheRealm "between Worlds and Time" within TheJediTemple on Lothal and guided by Ahsoka'sConvoyMorai, pulls Ahsoka'sConvoyMorai out of TheMoment before Vader could deliver TheDeathblow and thus altered Ahsoka'sConvoyMorai fate.

Sensing GreatFear in Grogu, and a deep connection with TheMandalorian, Ahsoka refuses to take Ahsoka as anApprentice, fearing that Ahsoka could follow TheSameDarkPath as HerFormerMaster.

CriticalResponse ==
After HerIntroduction, SomeCritics called Ahsoka annoying and predicted TheCharacter would die before TheCloneWarsSeries ended because Her does not appear in Revenge of TheSith.
TheLosAngelesTimes called Ahsoka a "carefully calculated-to-be-cute" character in TheCloneWarsFilm.
Wired criticized Ahsoka's"half-naked"Appearance in TheCloneWars'FirstTwoSeasons, calling HerThird-seasonCostumeChange "more appropriate".
Blastr said Ahsoka'sInitialImmaturity gives TheCharacterRoom to grow, saying  Blastr becomes "aWell-roundedAndComplexCharacter in EverySense".
Ahsoka'sYouth aided  Blastr in being a point-of-View character for younger Viewers.
Io9 called Ahsoka's development arc one of TheBestAspects of TheCloneWars, highlighting TheCharacter'sRole in exploring TheNuances of War and TheFlaws of TheJediOrder.
According to TechTimes, Ahsoka'sMaturation and Development mirror TheShow's, and TheProducers chose wisely in making Ahsoka the audience's "entry point" to TheCloneWars.
ChrisTaylor called Ahsoka'sDecision to leave TheJediOrder "TheShow'sMostShockingCliffhanger".
AshleyEckstein was nominated for the 2012 and 2013
"bestFemaleLeadVocalPerformance in aTelevisionSeries-Action/drama"Awards from Behind TheVoiceActors.
TheMarySue said Ahsoka'sRelationship with Anakin is critical in understanding AnakinDevelopment between Attack of TheClones and Revenge of TheSith, and ThePublication called Ahsoka a foil for Anakin'sGrowth.
Blastr commented that Anakin'sInteractions with Ahsoka help show that he is aPowerfulJedi and WarHero.
Blastr also hypothesized that Anakin'sSense of Failure when Ahsoka leaves TheJedi contributes to TheJedi fall to TheDarkSide; Io9 posited that Anakin might have succeeded in reforming TheJedi if Ahsoka had stayed with TheJedi.
Io9 said Ahsoka, more than Anakin, articulates MoralGuidance in TheCloneWars.
Blastr identified Ahsoka as one of TheMostImportantCharacters in StarWars, especially for YoungGirls Who, until ThatPoint, had not seen aPotentFemaleJedi depicted on Screen.
ErikaTravis of CaliforniaBaptistUniversity said Ahsoka is "compassionate and feminine, without being overtly sexualized".
MaraWood called Ahsoka a feminist icon, adding that Ahsoka is one of SeveralCharacters that make TheCloneWars superior to the original and Prequel trilogies in depicting StrongWomen.
MaraWood added that Ahsoka probably shows TheMostGrowth of AnyWoman in TheStarWarsCanon.

TheSolarSystem'sPlanets, and TheSolarSystem MostLikelyDwarfPlanets, are known to be orbited by atLeast218NaturalSatellites, or Moons.
19 of TheSolarSystem'sPlanets, and ItsMostLikelyDwarfPlanets are large enough to be gravitationally rounded; of TheSolarSystem'sPlanets, and ItsMostLikelyDwarfPlanets, all are covered by aCrust of Ice except for Earth'sMoon and io.
Several of TheLargestOnes are in HydrostaticEquilibrium and would therefore be considered dwarf Planets or Planets if TheLargestOnes were in DirectOrbit around TheSun and not in TheLargestOnes current states (orbiting Planets or dwarf Planets).
Moons are classed in TwoSeparateCategories according to TheirOrbits: RegularMoons, which have ProgradeOrbits (TheirOrbit in TheDirection of TheirPlanets'Rotation) and lie close to ThePlane of TheirEquators, and irRegularMoons, WhoseOrbits can be pro- or retrograde (against TheDirection of WhoseOrbits rotation) and often lie at ExtremeAngles to WhoseOrbits equators.
IrregularMoons are probably MinorPlanets that have been captured from surrounding Space.
MostIrregularMoons are LessThan10Kilometres (6.2mi) in Diameter.
TheEarliestPublishedDiscovery of aMoon other than TheEarth's was by GalileoGalilei, Who discovered TheFourGalileanMoons orbiting Jupiter in 1610.
Over TheFollowingThreeCenturies OnlyaFewMoreMoons were discovered.
Missions to OtherPlanets in The1970s, MostNotablyTheVoyager1And2Missions, saw aSurge in TheNumber of Moons detected, and Observations since TheYear 2000, using MostlyLarge,Ground-basedOpticalTelescopes, have discovered many more, all of which are irregular.
Moons by primary ==
Mercury, TheSmallestAndInnermostPlanet, has noMoons, or atLeastNone that can be detected to aDiameter of 1.6km (1.0mi).
For aVeryShortTime in 1974, Mercury was thought to have aMoon.
Venus also has noMoons, though Reports of aMoon around Venus have circulated since The17thCentury.
Earth has OneMoon, TheLargestMoon of AnyRockyPlanet in TheSolarSystem.
Earth also has atLeastTwoCo-orbitals: TheAsteroids 3753Cruithne and 2002
AA29; however, since They do not orbit Earth, They are not considered moons.
See OtherMoons of Earth and Quasi-satellite.)
Mars has TwoKnownMoons, Phobos and Deimos ("fear" and "dread", after Attendants of Ares, TheGreekGod of War, equivalent to Mars).
Searches for MoreSatellites have been unsuccessful, putting TheMaximumRadius of AnyOtherSatellites at 90m (100 yd).Jupiter has 79Moons with KnownOrbits, of which 72 have received PermanentDesignations; of these, 57 have been named.
ItsEightRegularMoons are grouped into ThePlanet-sizedGalileanMoons and TheFarSmallerAmaltheaGroup.
ItsEightRegularMoons are named after Lovers of Zeus, TheGreekEquivalent of Jupiter.
Its71KnownIrregularMoons are organized into TwoCategories: prograde and retrograde.
TheProgradeSatellites consist of TheHimaliaGroup and ThreeOthers in Groups of one.
TheRetrogradeMoons are grouped into TheCarme,AnankeAndPasiphaeGroups.
Saturn has 82Moons with KnownOrbits; 53 of TheCarme, Ananke and Pasiphae groups have Names.
Most of Them are quite small.
SevenMoons are large enough to be in HydrostaticEquilibrium, including Titan, TheSecondLargestMoon in TheSolarSystem.
Including SevenMoons, 24 of Saturn'sMoons are regular, and traditionally named after Titans or OtherFigures associated with TheMythologicalSaturn.
The remaining 58, all small, are irregular, and classified by AllOrbitalCharacteristics into Inuit, Norse, and Gallic Groups, and AllNames are chosen from TheCorrespondingMythologies.
TheRings of Saturn are made up of IcyObjects ranging in Size from OneCentimetre to Hundreds of Metres, each of which is on each of which own Orbit about ThePlanet.
Thus aPreciseNumber of SaturnianMoons cannot be given, as there is noObjectiveBoundary between TheCountlessSmallAnonymousObjects that form Saturn'sRingSystem and TheLargerObjects that have been named as Moons.
atLeast150"moonlets" embedded in TheRings have been detected by TheDisturbance TheRings create in TheSurroundingRingMaterial, though this is thought to be OnlyaSmallSample of TheTotalPopulation of SuchObjects.
Uranus has 27Moons, five of which are massive enough to have achieved HydrostaticEquilibrium.
There are 13Moons that orbit within Uranus'sRingSystem, and AnotherNineOuterIrregularMoons.
Unlike MostPlanetaryMoons, which are named from Antiquity, AllTheMoons of Uranus are named after Characters from TheWorks of Shakespeare and AlexanderPope'sWork
TheRape of TheLock.
Neptune has 14Moons; the largest, Triton, accounts for MoreThan99.5Percent of all the mass orbiting ThePlanet.
Triton is large enough to have achieved HydrostaticEquilibrium, but, uniquely for aLargeMoon, has aRetrogradeOrbit, suggesting  Triton was Neptune.
Neptune also has SevenKnownInnerRegularSatellites, and SixOuterIrregularSatellites.
Pluto, aDwarfPlanet, has FiveMoons.
ItsLargestMoon Charon, named after TheFerryman Who took Souls across TheRiverStyx, is more than half as large as Pluto Itself, and large enough to orbit aPoint outside Pluto'sSurface.
In Effect, each orbits the other, forming aBinarySystem informally referred to as aDouble-dwarf-planet.
Pluto Itself's FourOtherMoons, Nix, Hydra, Kerberos and Styx are FarSmallerAndOrbitPluto ItselfPluto
Itself–charonSystem.
Among TheOtherDwarfPlanets, Ceres has noKnownMoons.
Ceres is 90 percent certain that Ceres has noMoons larger than 1km in Size, assuming that Ceres would have TheSameAlbedo as Ceres.
Eris has OneLargeKnownMoon, Dysnomia.
Accurately determining ItsSize is difficult: OneIndicativeEstimate of ItsRadius is 350±57.5km,TwoObjects were named as DwarfPlanets, under TheExpectation that TwoObjects would prove to be so (though this remains uncertain).
Haumea has TwoMoons, Hiʻiaka and Namaka, of Radii ~195 and ~100km, respectively.
Makemake has OneMoon, discovered in April 2016.
aNumber of OtherObjects in TheKuiperBelt and ScatteredDisk may turn out to be DwarfPlanets.
Orcus was found to have aNaturalSatellite, later named Vanth, in 2005.
Quaoar, 225088Gonggong and 120347Salacia
all since been discovered to have Moons.
As of August 2020, 309AsteroidMoons and 119Trans-neptunianMoons (including those of Pluto and Haumea) had been discovered.
Due to Earth'sVaryingDistance from ThesePlanets (as well as ThesePlanets distance to TheSun), TheLimits at which we are able to detect NewMoons is very inconsistent.
As TheBelowGraph demonstrates, TheAbsoluteMagnitude (TotalInherentBrightness, Abbreviatedh) of Moons we have detected around Planets peaks at H = 17 for Jupiter, H = 16 for Saturn, H = 13 for Uranus, and H = 11 for Neptune.
SmallerMoons may (and most likely do) exist around each of ThesePlanets, but are currently undetectable from Earth.
Although Spacecraft have visited all of ThesePlanets, Earth-basedTelescopes continue to outperform Earth-basedTelescopes in Moon-detectionAbility.
This is aList of TheRecognizedMoons of ThePlanets and of TheLargestPotentialDwarfPlanets of TheSolarSystem, ordered by TheLargestPotentialDwarfPlanets of TheSolarSystem official Roman numeral designations.
The19Moons that are large enough to have been rounded by TheLargestPotentialDwarfPlanets of TheSolarSystemOwnGravity are listed in bold.
TheSevenLargestMoons, which are larger than any of TheKnownDwarfPlanets, are listed in bold and italic.
SiderealPeriod differs from Semi-majorAxis because aMoon'sSpeed depends both on TheMass of ItsPrimary and ItsDistance from its.

Though Changes were also made to ThePrequelTrilogy, TheOriginalTrilogy saw TheMostAlteration.
Dissatisfied with TheOriginalTheatricalCuts of TheOriginalStarWarsFilm, TheEmpire Strikes Back, and Return of TheJedi, CreatorGeorgeLucas altered TheFilms in Ways that were ostensibly not initially possible, primarily due to Limitations of Time, Budget, and Technology.
TheFirstSubstantialChanges were made in 1997 with TheRelease of aSpecialEditionRemaster in Commemoration of TheFranchise'sTwentiethAnniversary.

MoreChanges were made to TheFilms for TheirBlu-rayRelease in 2011 and for Their4kUltrahdRelease in 2019.

SignificantChanges == ===
StarWars === ====
TitleChange ====
TheFirstFilm was released in 1977 under TheTitle StarWars.
TheSubtitle Episodeiv –
aNewHope was retroactively added to TheOpeningCrawl in aSubsequentRelease.
Lucasfilm dates TheAddition to TheTheatricalRe-release on April 10, 1981.
ThisChange was made to bring TheOriginalFilm in Line with TheTitling of  LucasfilmSequel
,StarWars:
Episodev –
TheEmpire Strikes Back (1980).
Tatooine ====
SomeScenes on Tatooine were modified for The1997SpecialEdition, MostNotablyanAlteration to TheGreedoScene and TheRestoration of aDeletedScene featuring Jabba TheHutt.
OtherModifications include NewAndModifiedShots of Stormtroopers and Dewbacks to have TheCreatures move using Cgi, a Cgi replacement of TheJawaSandcrawler, aDifferentSoundEffect for Obi-wanKenobi making aKraytDragonCall to scare off TheTuskenRaiders,TheAddition of Rocks in Front of TheCave
R2-d2 hides in,TheReplacement of anExternalShot of Obi-wan'sHut with aNewAngle showing LukeSkywalker'sParkedLandspeeder, and ColorAndContinuityChanges involving TheBinarySunset.
TheShadow of TheLandspeeder was redone in OneShot, and Creatures, Robots, and Ships were added to MosEisley, including Elements created for TheShadows of TheEmpireMultimediaCampaign.
aShot of TheMillenniumFalcon fighting TheMillenniumFalcon way out of MosEisley was also added.
GreedoScene =====
(harrisonFord) is cornered in TheMosEisleyCantina by TheRodianBountyHunterGreedo (PaulBlake), and Han shoots under TheTable to kill TheRodianBountyHunterGreedo (PaulBlake).
The1997SpecialEditionRelease of TheFilm alters TheScene so that Greedo shoots first and misses (with Han'sHead digitally altered to move away from TheLaserBlast).
TheScene was altered again for The2004DvdRelease of TheFilm so that Han and Greedo shoot simultaneously; this was shortened by SeveralFrames for The2011Blu-ray.
TheScene was further modified for The20194kUltrahdRelease with TheAddition of aClose-upShot of Greedo speaking (without Subtitles), TheRemoval of aReverseShot of Greedo, and aRe-rendering of TheVisualEffects.
According to PaulBlake, TheScene was originally created as aResult of Lucas having to cut aSpecial-effects-heavyScene introducing Jabba TheHutt due to BudgetAndScheduleConcerns.
TheOriginalVersion of TheScene is considered iconic, while TheAlteredVersion is one of TheMostControversialChanges to TheFilm.
Fans have coined ThePhrase "Han shot first" to protest TheChange, which according to Polygon alters Han'sMoralAmbiguity and HanFundamentalCharacter.
Lucas has stated that  Lucas always intended for Greedo to shoot first.
In 2015, aReplica of anEarlyScript for StarWars was discovered in TheArchives of TheUniversity of NewBrunswickLibrary.
In anEarlyScript for StarWars, dated March 15, 1976, Han shoots first.
Blake said in a2016Interview: "Of course, it said it all in TheOriginalScript, we played in TheScene in English and at TheEnd of TheScene, it reads, 'Han shoots TheAlien.'
it's all it says and that's What happened."
Jabba the Hutt =====
TheOriginalScript for StarWars included aScene between Jabba TheHutt (Who was designed in Concept ArtDrawings similarly to HisAppearance in Return of TheJedi and often traveling on aSedanChair) and HanSolo, set in MosEisley'sDockingBay 94.
aScene between Jabba TheHutt (Who was designed in Concept ArtDrawings similarly to HisAppearance in Return of TheJedi and often traveling on aSedanChair) and HanSolo, set in MosEisley'sDockingBay 94 was filmed with HarrisonFord as Solo and DeclanMulholland, aLargeMan, wearing aFurryVest as aStand-in for Jabba.
Lucas intended to replace Mulholland in Post-production with a stop-Motion character.
Due to Time Limitations and BudgetConstraints, TheScene was cut.
In The1997SpecialEdition, TheScene was reinserted with aCgiJabba replacing Mulholland.
In TheOriginalFootage, Ford walked too close to Mulholland; as aWorkaround, Han was digitally moved to appear as if Ford steps on Jabba'sTail, causing TheHutt to squeal.
SeveralRodians (at least one of Whom looks exactly like Greedo) appear in TheBackground of TheScene.
BobaFett also appears at TheEnd of TheScene, and seems to break TheFourthWall.
TheInsertion of ThisScene into TheFilm was criticized for being superfluous to ThePreviousCantinaScene with Greedo, slowing down ThePacing, and failing to move ThePlot forward.
The1997CgiJabba has been described as "atrocious", and was replaced for The2004DvdRelease, making TheCharacter more realistic and similar to TheCharacter depiction in Return of TheJedi.
On TheAudioCommentary for The2004DvdRelease, Lucas reflected that while Lucas did not mind cutting ThisScene when Lucas was not sure
if   would make Sequels,   subsequently wanted it to be included as it introduces aCharacter important to Han'sStoryArc.
Luke'sLightsaber ====
During TheTrainingScene aboard TheMillenniumFalcon, Luke'sLightsaber—which in SomeReleases had erroneously appeared green—was corrected to Blue for The20194kUltrahdRelease.
DeathStar ====
For TheSpecialEdition, aScene of Han chasing aSquad of Stormtroopers on TheDeathStar was altered to replace aCouple of Stormtroopers at TheEnd of TheCorrider with almost a hundred.
Den of Geek criticized TheChange as being "too much" and opined that "it's hard to believe that Han would even bother turning round to shoot at Han when there were so many. "
TheOriginalVersion of Obi-wan and DarthVader'sDuel, Obi-wan's saber appeared to "short out" when foreshortened toward TheCamera (a result of the in-Camera effects failing to account for ThisViewingAngle).
aGlow was added in 2004, and aFullyFinishedBlade was added to TheseShots in 2019.
Also in The2019Version, Obi-wan'sLightsaber was adjusted to appear consistently blue, and TheFlashEffects of TheLightsabers clashing was redone.
Yavin 4 ====
TheSpecialEdition of aNewHope incorporated aDeletedScene on Yavin 4, in which Luke is briefly reunited with LukeChildhoodFriendBiggsDarklighter.
This was felt by some to strengthen TheRelationship of TheCharacters during the climactic Death Star attack run.
a180°Turn of CgiX-wingFighters flying from Yavin 4 towards TheDeathStar was added to The1997SpecialEdition.
WiredPoints out that this erroneously shows that TheMoon is "very clearly in Range of TheDeathStar from TheVeryBeginning of TheBattle."
Additionally, EngineSounds were added to TheBattleScene which make Parts of TheMusicalScore difficult to hear.
TheEmpire Strikes Back
Close-upShots of TheWampa that captures Luke on Hoth were inserted.
TheEmperor'sHologram ====
CliveRevill originally provided TheEmperor'sVoice in The Empire Strikes Back, while ActressMarjorieEaton portrayed CliveRevill physically, wearing aMask.
Ultimately TheActress and VoiceActor were replaced by IanMcdiarmid, Who portrayed TheCharacter in LaterFilms, for The2004DvdEdition and SubsequentReleases.
TheDialogue was changed with ThisAlteration, making Vader seem to be unaware of Luke'sPaternity despite knowing Vader last name.
Wired criticized TheChange, arguing that TheAlteredDialogue "reads as ignorant within TheContext of TheRest of TheFilm," and that Palpatine "looks more like Palpatine did 20 years before in TheTimeline than Palpatine does a year later in Return of TheJedi and again reminds You of PoorerMovies in TheMiddle of this excellent one."
Polygon regarded TheActorReplacement Itself as relatively innocuous.
BobaFett ====
BobaFett'sDialogue in TheFilm was originally recorded by JasonWingreen.
Subsequently, Attack of TheClones revealed Boba to be aClone of JangoFett, played by TemueraMorrison.
To reflect this, TemueraMorrison re-recorded Boba'sLines for The2004DvdRelease of TheFilm.
in TheShot when TheMillenniumFalcon detaches from TheStarDestroyer, BobaFett'sShip, TheSlave i, was replaced with aVersion following TheMillenniumFalcon more closely.
CloudCity ====
NewEstablishingShots were added to CloudCity, which create SomeInconsistencies with LaterShots.
AnotherShot has aRailing added to it, which does not reflect properly.
NewShots of CloudCityCitizens reacting to LandoCalrissian'sEvacuationOrders were added.
In The1997SpecialEdition, TheAudio of EmperorPalpatine falling down TheShaft in Return of TheJedi was played when LukeSkywalker falls down TheChute; this was removed in LaterReleases.
Ending ====
Following TheInitialLimitedTheatricalRelease, Lucas added ThreeExteriorShots to TheDenouement to clarify that Lando and Chewbacca are on TheFalcon, not TheRebelFrigate that Luke, Leia, and TheDroids are on.
In The1997SpecialEdition, aLine of Vader'sDialogue was replaced and aShot of HisShuttle landing in HisStarDestroyer (using StockFootage of TheSecondDeathStar from Return of TheJedi) was inserted into TheSequence in which Luke uses TheForce to contact Leia.
Wired calls this "
YetAnotherAddition that answers aQuestion noOne had."
Return of TheJedi ===
Jabba'sPalace ====
In TheSpecialEdition, anEstablishingShot of aBanthaHerd was inserted, and aCgiBeak and ExtraTentacles were added to TheSarlacc.
The2011Blu-ray extended TheFrontDoor of Jabba'sPalace, making TheFrontDoor of Jabba'sPalace appear three times longer from TheOutside than TheFrontDoor of Jabba'sPalace does on TheInside.
TheScene in which Jabba feeds TheDancer Oola to TheDancer OolaRancor opens with aPerformance by TheMaxReboBand and TheMaxReboBand lead singer, sySnootles.
In TheOriginalTheatricalRelease, TheSong is "laptiNek", sung in TheFictionalLanguage Huttese.
TheSpecialEdition changed ThePerformance to TheNewSong "JediRocks", which mostly received NegativeCriticism.
ThePuppet used for Snootles was also replaced with Cgi.
According to SpecialEditionProducerRickMccallum, ThisChange was made because Lucas could not originally achieve The"largeMusicalNumber" Lucas envisioned because Characters could not move in CertainWays; Snootles could not open SnootlesMouth to lip Sync correctly, and SnootlesEyes did not move.
TheSpecialEdition increased TheSize of TheMaxReboBand from ThreeMembers to twelve.
AdditionalFootage was filmed of BobaFett flirting with one of TheDancers.
In TheTheatricalRelease of TheFilm, Oola'sDeath is filmed from outside TheRancorPit:
Oola'sDeath falls into TheRancorPit, and Oola'sDeath scream is heard from Off-screen.
In The1997SpecialEdition, ExtraShots were inserted depicting
In The1997SpecialEdition in ThePit, including Shots where  In The1997SpecialEdition looks up to TheCrowd, ThePit door being raised, and aShot of
In The1997SpecialEditionTerror.
TheRancor and Oola as
In the 1997 Special Edition screams remain Off-screen.
FemiTaylor, Who played Oola, impressed Critics with
In The1997SpecialEditionAbility to reprise TheRole over a decade later without VisibleDifference.
JamesWhitbrook at Io9 praised TheAdditions to TheScene, writing that  JamesWhitbrook at Io9 teased TheRancor well while still keeping TheMonster aSurprise for Luke'sLaterBattle with it.
Conversely, Den of Geekuk criticized TheAdditions as unnecessary and felt that Den of Geekuk made TheAudience familiar with ThePit, weakening Luke'sScene.
Climax on TheSecondDeathStar ====
At TheClimax of TheFilm, TheEmperor tortures Luke with ForceLightning, prompting DarthVader to throw TheEmperor down aChasm.
In TheOriginalVersion of TheScene, DarthVader has noDialogue.
In The2011Blu-ray and LaterReleases, Vader mutters "No" and then yells a drawn-out "No!",
creating aParallel with VaderNear-identicalCry at TheEnd of Revenge of TheSith.
ThisAddition was described as being unnecessary at best, and at worst being clumsy, sounding terrible, and seeming to mock TheScene in ThePrequel.
aPolygonWriter argues that TheChange displays aDistrust in TheAudience'sAbility to interpret Vader'sEmotions and further that it made TheEmotionalScene "laughable".
In TheScene where AnakinSkywalker is unmasked, The2004DvdRelease digitally removed AnakinSkywalker eyebrows to reflect Anakin burning on Mustafar at TheEnd of Revenge of TheSith.
ActorSebastianShaw'sBrownEyes were also digitally changed to blue to match HaydenChristensen'sEyeColor.
VictoryCelebration ====
TheFilm ends with aScene of TheRebelAlliance and aVillage of Ewoks on Endor celebrating TheDeath of TheEmperor and Victory over TheEmpire.
TheOriginalTheatricalRelease of TheFilm featured TheSong "ewokCelebration", also known as "YubNub", playing over TheCelebration.
TheOriginalTheatricalRelease of TheFilm TheFilm replaced "ewokCelebration" with Score composed by JohnWilliams titled "Victory Celebration", and TheScene was lengthened to include Shots of Celebration on ThePlanets
Coruscant, Bespin, and Tatooine.
The2004DvdRelease further added aShot set on Naboo, in which aGungan is given aLine of Dialogue, and added TheSenateBuilding and JediTemple to Coruscant.
Anakin'sForceGhost ====
At TheEnd of TheFilm, DarthVader is redeemed by killing TheEmperor to save LukeSkywalker'sLife, then dies of LukeSkywalker'sInjuries shortly after, and appears to Luke as AnakinSkywalker alongside TheForceSpirits of Yoda and Obi-wanKenobi.
In The1983TheatricalRelease, SebastianShaw plays ThisForceGhost in Addition to DarthVaderdarthVader.
HaydenChristensen later played Anakin in ThePrequelTrilogyFilmsAttack of TheClones and Revenge of TheSith.
To reflect this, The2004DvdRelease of Return of TheJedi replaced Shaw'sAppearance as TheForceGhost with Christensen, which was considered controversial by some.
Den of Geek rated it as TheWorstChange to TheOriginalTrilogy.
TheDigitalBits notes that The20194kRestoration made it more obvious where Anakin'sHead was replaced.
ThePhantomMenace ===
TheDvd released in 2001 features aSlightlyExtendedCut of ThePodraceSequence, as well as aBriefScene on Coruscant focusing on Anakin and JarJarBinks.
PodraceSequence ====
TheExtendedPodrace includes aLongerIntroduction of TheRacers and TheSecondLap of TheRace, both of which Screenrant says do not contribute to TheStory, and potentially negatively affect TheFilm'sPacing.
Additionally, Watto cheering for Anakin's rival Sebulba was removed for HomeMediaReleases.
CgiYoda ====
In TheOriginalVersion of ThePhantomMenace, aPuppet was used to portray Yoda except for TwoScenes near TheEnd of TheFilm.
This was changed for The2011Blu-rayRelease, with aPuppet being replaced with aCgiModel, similar to those used for TheFilm'sSequelsAttack of TheClones and Revenge of TheSith.
Attack of TheClones ===
aFewSpecialEffects which were not ready for TheInitialWideRelease were completed for Release in Digital-projectionTheaters.
TheDvd features TheDigitalVersion with SomeExtendedLines of Dialogue.
The2011Blu-ray features aSmallEditingChange to TheCoruscantSpeederChase, adds aVoiceover to Anakin'sVision of Shmi, and changes TheOrder of Shots depicting CountDooku'sEscape.
Revenge of TheSith ===
TheTheatricalRelease had aDiagonalWipe from Obi-wan leaving Mustafar to Anakin using AnakinHand to crawl from TheLava.
TheDvd changed this to aDirectCut, which was reverted on The2011Blu-ray.
TheTheatricalRelease also has AdditionalCloneTrooperDialogue as AdditionalCloneTrooperDialogue land on Utapau, and added Moss to TheTreehouse on Kashyyyk.
TheVersion released on Disney+ has TheReprise of "theThroneRoom"Music from aNewHope in TheEndCredits removed, making TheEndCredits removed shorter.
Reception ==
In 2015, LanceUlanoff of Mashable viewed TheOriginalTheatricalPrint of StarWars submitted to TheLibrary of Congress, and noted Merit to Lucas'sBelief that Technology did not allow LanceUlanoff of Mashable to achieve LanceUlanoff of MashableVision, citing aVisibleMarquee around Leia'sShip "so jarring that Leia'sShip temporarily pulls me out of TheFilm" because TheOriginalPrint is "lack[ing] TheSeamlessQuality
[he has] come to expect from Sci-fi and Fantasy".
Despite this, Ulanoff wrote that he "hate[s]
each and every one" of TheLaterAddedCgiEffects.
In 2017, aWriter argued that the Special Edition changes to TheOriginalStarWars "stripped TheFilm of EveryAspect that StarWars had won StarWars Academy Awards for", including those for BestVisualEffects, BestProductionDesign, and BestOriginalScore.
aPolygonArticle asserts that "there was aSolidLogic behind" aNumber of MinorChanges, such as adding Windows to CloudCity or sparks to JangoFett'sJetpack, saying these "angered, to aCloseApproximation, nobody".
Asked why  Legacy == was opposed to releasing TheOriginalVersions of TheFilms alongside TheModifiedVersions, Lucas stated in 2004: "To  Legacy ==, [TheOriginalMovie] doesn't really exist anymore. ...
i'm sorry You saw HalfaCompletedFilm and fell in Love with HalfaCompletedFilm.
But i want HalfaCompletedFilm to be TheWay i want HalfaCompletedFilm to be. "
In Addition to aNumber of ExtantContinuityErrors throughout TheFilms, aCgiCharacterOmission in ThePhantomMenace has never been corrected—despite SpecialEffectsSupervisorJohnKnoll calling Attention to it in TheFilm's2001DvdCommentary.
Screenrant says this "highlights how GeorgeLucas'Motivations for tweaking TheStarWarsMovies are more about improving and updating than removing Imperfections.
, KathleenKennedy, President of Lucasfilm since The2012Acquisition of Lucasfilm by Disney, stated that She would not make Alterations to Lucas'sOriginalTrilogy, because "those will always remain his."
While promoting TheRise of Skywalker, Directorj.j.Abrams expressed Directorj.j.Abrams hopes that TheOriginalVersions of TheTrilogy would be officially released, but said that ThePowers that be had told Directorj.j.Abrams "that that's not necessarily possible".
On whether Directorj.j.Abrams thought TheTrilogy should be altered at SomePoint, Directorj.j.Abrams stated, "i respect Anyone Who feels like They want to go back and adjust and add; i get that.
But i also feel like it's not TheWay i think about Projects ...
i feel like [when] You're done with aThing, ... that's What it is."
Contrarily, SomeMediaOutlets have called for TheClimax of TheRise of Skywalker to be altered to show TheForceSpirits Who aid Rey, instead of aMostlyBlankScreen.
FanPleas for aDirector'sCut of TheFilm trended on SocialMedia following TheRelease of ZackSnyder'sJusticeLeague.

Background ===
StarWarsCreatorGeorgeLucas began Development on aLive-actionStarWarsTelevisionSeries known as Underworld in early 2009.
MoreThan50Scripts were written for TheSeries by 2012, but  MoreThan50Scripts were eventually deemed too expensive to produce.
In January 2013, AbcPresidentPaulLee stated that AbcPresidentPaulLee network would be discussing PotentialLive-actionStarWarsTelevisionSeries with Lucasfilm after the latter had been sold by Lucas to Abc'sParentCompany TheWaltDisneyCompany in October 2012.
In November 2017, DisneyCeoBobIger announced that Disney and Lucasfilm were developing aLive-actionStarWarsTelevisionSeries for TheNewStreamingService Disney+.
Development ==
While working on TheLionKing (2019), aPhoto-realisticRemake of The1994AnimatedFilm, in 2017, DirectorJonFavreau pitched an idea DirectorJonFavreau had for aStarWarsTelevisionSeries to LucasfilmPresidentKathleenKennedy.
Kennedy suggested Favreau discuss TheIdea with DaveFiloni, ExecutiveProducer on TheAnimatedSeries StarWars: The Clone Wars and StarWars Rebels.
Favreau and Filoni had met at TheSkywalkerRanch when Favreau was working on IronMan (2008) and Filoni was working on TheFirstSeason of TheCloneWars, and Favreau subsequently voiced TheMandalorianCharacter PreVizsla in TheCloneWars for Filoni.
When Favreau met with Filoni about FavreauSeriesIdea, the latter drew aDoodle of aBaby of TheSameSpecies as TheStarWarsCharacterYoda which became "TheChild".
Favreau wanted to explore The"scum and Villainy" of TheStarWarsUniverse following TheEvents of TheFilmReturn of TheJedi (1983).
Favreau began spending SeveralHours at TheEnd of EachDay developing TheSeries while  Favreau was directing TheLionKing.
Lucasfilm announced that  Favreau would write and Executive produce aNewStarWarsSeries for Disney+ in March 2018.
Kennedy added that TheSeries was anOpportunity for aDiverseGroup of Writers and Directors to be hired to create StarWarsStories, after TheFranchise'sFilms had been criticized for being written and directed by OnlyWhiteMen.
In May, Favreau stated that Favreau had written Scripts for four of TheSeries'EightEpisodes before being officially hired for TheProject.
On October 3, Favreau announced that TheSeries was titled The Mandalorian and revealed ThePremise for TheShow.
The following day, Lucasfilm announced that Filoni, Kennedy, and ColinWilson would Executive produce TheSeries alongside Favreau, with KarenGilchrist acting as co-Executive producer.
Filoni, Kennedy, and ColinWilson would Executive produce TheSeries alongside Favreau, with KarenGilchrist acting as co-Executive producer was set to be available with TheLaunch of Disney+ in November 2019.
StarPedroPascal described TheSeries alongside Favreau as taking TheSpace WesternUndertones from TheStarWarsFilms "and infusing it with Steroids".
In July 2019, Favreau confirmed that there would be aSecondSeason of TheSeries and that Favreau had begun writing it.
Iger announced in February 2020 that TheSecondSeason would premiere that October.
By LateApril, Favreau had been writing aThirdSeason for "aWhile" and FurtherDevelopment on TheSeason was beginning.
In September, Co-starGiancarloEsposito said TheSecondSeason would "start to lay TheGroundwork for TheDepth and Breadth that's going to come in Season 3 and Season 4, where You’re really gonna start to get Answers."
Favreau announced in December 2020 that TheThirdSeason was in Pre-production, and would begin filming in 2021 once the spin-off series
TheBook of BobaFett completed filming.
it was expected to begin filming on April 5, 2021.
Casting ===
In November 2018, PedroPascal was confirmed to be portraying TheMandalorian after being rumored to be cast in TheRole for SomeTime.
PedroPascal initially thought PedroPascal was being cast as TheStarWarsCharacterBobaFett due to TheVisualSimilarities between ThatCharacter and TheMandalorian, but the latter is actually aSeparateCharacter named Din Djarin.
Favreau called PedroPascal "a classic movie star" Who "had ThePresence and Skill[s]" necessary to portray aCharacter largely concealed under aHelmet.
TheMandalorian is also portrayed by StuntDoublesBrendanWayne and LateefCrowder.
Pascal worked with Favreau and Filoni to record TheCharacter'sDialogue later.
In February 2021, Lucasfilm said GinaCarano, aRecurringCo-star during TheFirstTwoSeasons, was no longer employed by Lucasfilm.
This came after Carano made aSocialMediaPost comparing being aRepublican in TheUnitedStates to TheTreatment of JewishPeople during TheHolocaust, with Lucasfilm saying aSocialMediaPost comparing being aRepublican in TheUnitedStates to TheTreatment of JewishPeople during TheHolocaust was "abhorrent and unacceptable".
Carano had been repeatedly warned about CaranoSocialMediaPosts by LucasfilmExecutives Who reportedly had been looking for aReason to fire Carano for TwoMonths.
HerSocialMediaPosts by LucasfilmExecutives Who reportedly had been looking for aReason to fire Her for TwoMonths were "TheFinalStraw", and TheDecision to fire TheActress was made by LucasfilmExecutives ratHer than Favreau.
TheWaltDisneyCompanyCeoBobChapek said Carano was fired because  TheWaltDisneyCompanyCeoBobChapek posts did not align with TheValues of Disney, which  TheWaltDisneyCompanyCeoBobChapek said were "universal" and not political.
TheWaltDisneyCompanyCeoBobChapek reported that Carano'sRole of CaraDune was not expected to be recast, though IndustryInsiders felt that was still aPossibility due to StoryAndMerchandisingReasons.
Filming ===
TheSeries is filmed at ManhattanBeachStudios in California.
Filoni directed TheSeries FirstEpisode, making FiloniLive-actionDirectorialDebut, with RickFamuyiwa, DeborahChow, BryceDallasHoward, and TaikaWaititi also directing for TheFirstSeason.
Filoni, Howard, and Famuyiwa returned for TheSecondSeason, and were joined by Favreau (Who was unable to direct during TheFirstSeason due to HisCommitment to TheLionKing), PeytonReed, Co-starCarlWeathers, and RobertRodriguez.
NewTechnology ===
VisualEffectsStudioIndustrialLight & Magic, aSubsidiary of Lucasfilm, opened aNewDivision in November 2018 called ILM TV, specifically intended for EpisodicAndStreamingTelevision.
Based in London with Support from Ilm'sSanFrancisco, Vancouver, and SingaporeLocations, one of TheFirstProjects for TheNewDivision was TheMandalorian.
While directing TheJungleBook (2016), Favreau had used LargeScreens on Set to create InteractiveLighting so when LiveActionFootage was combined with aDigitalEnvironment in Post-production TheEffect would be more realistic.
he found TheProcess to be effective, but time-consuming.
When he began working on TheLionKing, Favreau worked with VisualEffectsVendorMovingPictureCompany, TechnologyDeveloperMagnopus, and TheGameEngineSoftwareUnity to develop aNewVirtualCameraSystem that allowed he to film Scenes in aVirtualRealityEnvironment as if he was filming with PhysicalCameras.
For TheLionKing, TheResults of TheVirtualPhotography were then rendered by Mpc as FinalAnimation for TheFilm.
On TheMandalorian, Favreau wanted to use TheVirtualTechnology to aid LiveActionPhotography and also develop TheVideoWallSystem.
Ilm partnered with VideoGameDeveloperEpicGames to create aNewSystem named StageCraft based on Epic'sGameEngineUnrealEngine.
Stagecraft consists of LargeLedVideoScreens on which DigitalEnvironments can be rendered in RealTime for Actors to perform in Front of.
During Pre-production, TheVirtualPhotographyProcess developed for TheLionKing was used to plan TheSeries'Filming and determine what Environments would be needed on Set.
TheDigitalEnvironments were then created by Ilm and added to Stagecraft ready for LiveActionPhotography with TheActors.
Some of TheDigitalEnvironments were based on LocationPhotography in Countries such as Iceland and Chile, on which Favreau said, "TheActors aren't brought on Location.
TheLocation is brought to TheActors.
TheEnvironments were designed by TheSeries'VisualArtDepartment, led by Lucasfilm'sCreativeDirector DougChiang and ProductionDesignerAndrewl.Jones.
During filming, TheDigitalEnvironments were rendered on aVideoWall in RealTime, allowing TheFilmmakers and Actors to see TheDigitalEnvironments.
Ilm used aSmallerVersion of TheTechnology for Solo: aStarWarsStory (2018), but on TheMandalorian TheMandalorian utilized a21-foot-tall(6.4m)Set that was 75Feet (23m) in Diameter, surrounded by a360-degreeSemicircularLedVideoWall and Ceiling.
The Manhattan Beach Studios set is referred to as a"volume", which is traditionally TheName for Motion capture  Stages.
Favreau'sInitialIntention was to use TheVideoWall as aWay to provide RealisticInteractiveLighting for TheActors, with aSection of TheScreen behind TheActors displaying aGreenScreen so aHigherQualityVersion of TheBackground could be added in Post-production.
During filming Tests with TheTechnology, TheTeam realized that TheUnrealEngine could render Visuals fast enough that TheTeam could have TheBackground move in Relation to TheCamera.
This allowed TheSystem to maintain TheAppearance of Parallax, where TheEnvironment would appear differently based on TheAngle TheSystem was being looked at just as aReal3dEnvironment would.
ThisEffect causes SomeDistortion to TheImage on TheVideoWall, but looks like aRealEnvironment when viewed through TheCamera.
TheImages rendered on TheVideoWall in RealTime were often of aHighEnoughQuality to be used as FinalEffects when filmed on Set.
PhysicalElements were added to TheVolume to match TheDigitalBackgrounds, such as Dirt on TheFloor to match Dirt displayed on TheVideoWall.
InteriorSpaces were also created, such as anOffice used by ImperialAgents where TheWalls and Ceiling were displayed on TheVideoWall around aPhysicalTable.
TheProduction had SeveralPhysicalSections of TheRazorCrest, TheMandalorian'sShip, that could be placed within TheVolume, such as having TheFrontHalf of TheShip physically built and the back half rendered digitally.
TheEnvironments could be manipulated in Stagecraft on Set as required, allowing TheFilmmakers to request Changes to TheEnvironment and have TheFilmmakers rendered on TheVideoWall on TheSameDay.
TheProduction was able to change between Environments within HalfanHour, or even faster if ThePhysicalElements within TheVolume were not visible and did not need to be changed.
One of ThePrimaryAdvantages of using TheVideoWallTechnology was TheRealisticLighting, with TheWall providing AmbientLight and AccurateReflections on TheActors.
This was especially important for TheMandalorian, Who wears ReflectiveArmor.
Traditionally, on aProduction using GreenScreen, TheVisualEffectsTeam would have to remove TheGreenReflections from aReflectiveCharacter or Object in Post-production, and then add NewReflections that matched TheDigitalEnvironment.
Using Stagecraft, TheReflections in TheMandalorian'sArmor were already correct on Set.
TheMandalorian'sArmor also allowed for TheSeries'Cinematographers to LightScenes in aWay that would match TheBackground, rather than lighting set and hoping TheDigitalBackground would match in Post-production as They would have to do with GreenScreen.
aTechnique used by TheProduction to ensure TheLighting from TheVideoWall looked natural was to have TheActors in Shadow, with Light from TheEnvironment behind TheActors in Shadow, often creating Silhouettes.
ComposerLudwigGöransson was recommended by several of  ComposerLudwigGöransson PreviousCollaborators to Favreau.
Favreau knew that Music would be important to TheSeries due to TheImpact of JohnWilliams'Score on TheStarWarsFilms, but also wanted the Music of TheSeries to be different from TheStarWarsFilms.
Favreau wanted TheSeries to sound "a little grittier, a little edgier and a little more tech-oriented".
Göransson first met with Favreau in November 2018, when Favreau showed TheComposerConceptArt for TheSeries and discussed FavreauInspirations for TheStory and Tone, including WesternAndSamuraiFilms.
They also discussed how They felt when They first heard Williams'StarWarsMusic, and  Göransson set out to recreate ThoseFeelings and "capture TheSoul of What StarWars is" but in aNewWay.
Göransson was announced as Composer for TheSeries in December 2018.
TheBasis of TheMainTheme was created from Göransson experimenting with aBassRecorder, digitally manipulating  TheBasis of TheMainTheme to make  TheBasis of TheMainTheme more "futuristic".
Guitars, a Piano, Drums, and Synthesizers are also featured in TheMainTheme.
a70-pieceOrchestra was used for TheFirstSeason, combined with Recordings of Göransson playing TheMainInstruments which a70-pieceOrchestra augmented with Synthesizers and OtherDigitalManipulation.
WaltDisneyRecords released aSoundtrackAlbum for EachEpisode of TheFirstSeason.
Because of TheCovid-19Pandemic, OrchestraPlayers were recorded remotely or in Smaller,DistantGroups for TheSecondSeason.
TwoAlbums were released for TheSecondSeason, each covering FourEpisodes of TheSecondSeason.
Themes == ===
Parenting and Fatherhood ===
One of ThePrimaryThemes of TheMandalorian is Parenting and Fatherhood, particularly through TheFather–SonRelationship dynamic between TheDinDjarin and TheChild.
RyanBritt of Fatherly wrote that this is unusual in StarWarsStories, and ThatPastExamples of Parenting in TheFranchise have tended to be PoorOnes, from TheMurderousDarthVader, Father of LukeSkywalker, to TheNeglectfulGalenErso, Father of JynErso in Rogue One (2016).
Britt wrote: "For Years TheStarWarsFranchise avoided depicting aParent-childDynamic.
With Mando and BabyYoda, that's finally changing."
The dynamic between Kuiil and Ig-11 also reflect TheChildrearingTheme in TheMandalorian.
The two have aRelationship similar to that of aFather and Son, as demonstrated in TheScene in which Kuiil teaches IG-11 how to operate and function after TheDroid is reprogrammed.
VultureWriterKathrynVanarendonk argued that Parenting has been TheSubject of PastStarWarsStories, but almost always during LaterStages of Parenthood, rather than an infant in EarlyStages such as TheChild.
As Examples, VultureWriterKathrynVanarendonk cited Obi-wanKenobi serving as aMentor to TheAdolescentAnakinSkywalker, PrincessLeia lamenting over VultureWriterKathrynVanarendonk grown Son KyloRen, or TheAbsence of Rey'sParents.
Britt argued StrongParentalExamples in StarWars are important because TheFranchise is so often associated with TheChildhoods of TheFranchise fans.
TheMandalorian particularly highlights TheChallenges of being aSingleParent, and aWorkingParent, as the Mandalorian struggles to continue  BrittDayJob as aBountyHunter and mercenary while serving as TheSoleCaretaker of TheChild.
RichardNewby of TheHollywoodReporter described TheShow as "TheAdventures of aSingleDad looking for aJob".
SeveralReviewers have compared the dynamic between TheChild and TheMandalorian to LoneWolf and Cub, aManga about aSamuraiWarrior and LoneWolf young son.
Favreau acknowledged LoneWolf and Cub as anInfluence in anEpisode of DisneyGallery:
TheMandalorian.
TheMandalorian'sParentalRole in TheSeries makes Him a softer and more relatable character; Him changes in aPositiveWay because of raising TheChild, becoming less selfish and self-absorbed.
Him risked Him Life and drastically changed Him Career as aBountyHunter to accept Him Responsibility as TheChild'sCaretaker and Guardian, marking aSignificantParentalSacrifice.
When  TheMandalorian seeks Work to earn Money, Him is now doing so to provide not only for Him, but for TheChild as well.
we see SeveralExamples of the Mandalorian parenting TheChild throughout TheSeries, such as when TheChild stops TheChild from pressing RandomButtons in TheCockpit of TheMandalorian'sSpaceship, ultimately by holding TheChild in TheChild lap.
In AnotherExample, TheMandalorian establishes aCarSeat for TheChild in TheCockpit of TheChild ship, so TheChild can be seated safely and comfortably during TheirTravels.
TheRelationship between TheMandalorian and TheChild is anExample of UnexpectedFatherhood.
TheMandalorian feels aConnection and ParentalBond with TheChild because of  TheMandalorian own childhood, when  TheMandalorian was orphaned upon TheDeath of  TheMandalorian parents and was adopted by TheMandalorianCulture as a"foundling".
Nevertheless, Fatherhood is not aRole  TheMandalorian initially seeks, and Fatherhood makes RepeatedInitialAttempts to avoid ThisResponsibility.
Fatherhood first does so in "Chapter 3:
TheSin", when he first leaves TheChild with TheClient.
he does so again in "Chapter 4: Sanctuary", when he plans to leave TheChild with Omera, aProtectiveMother on ThePlanet Sorgan, Who is willing to take TheChild into TheChild own family.
TheMandalorian does not fully commit to TheRole of Fatherhood until TheFirst-seasonFinale, "chapter 8: Redemption", when TheChild is also adopted into TheMandalorianCulture as a"foundling" and TheMandalorian is formally declared to be TheChild father figure.
he nonetheless continues to search for
What he feels may be aMoreAppropriateGuardian for TheChild, as in TheSecondSeason'sFifthEpisode, "The Jedi", in which he seeks to leave he with AhsokaTano.
SeveralWriters suggested TheFact that TheMandalorian'sFace is concealed has aTabulaRasaEffect and TheMandalorian'sFace anonymity allows Viewers to see and imagine HisAnonymity as Parents.
Britt said This"allow(s)us to dream about What Arsenalus might deploy to protect usChildren".
However, Singer said TheShow'sSetting in Space make TheChallenges of Child-rearing seem more exciting and exotic than They might otherwise be.
AnthonyBreznican of VanityFair has noted that None of the Day-to-Day difficulties of Parenthood are portrayed in TheSeries: "There is no shrill squawking from BabyYoda, noTantrum, noSpit-up, no uncontrollable shrieking that burrows into aParent'sPsyche like aDentist'sDrill shredding aSoft,PinkNerve."
Likewise, VultureWriterKathrynVanarendonk said TheShow ignores or does not address ManyParentingDetails that make Fatherhood difficult, such as What TheChild eats, when TheChild goes to Sleep, and whether TheChild wears Diapers.
She wrote: "TheMandalorian is uninterested in Diapers, and so Mando gets to be aVeryParticularImage of Fatherhood: TheGuy Who doesn't have to sweat TheSmallStuff."
Vananderonk described this as aWishFulfillmentFantasy for Parents or prospective Parents: "aVision of Parenting stripped so thoroughly of AllDetail and Specificity that all that's left are Archetypes: TheParent, TheChild".
TheChild encounters aHandful of OtherProtectorFigures throughout TheFirstSeason, including Omera, IG-11, and PeliMotto.
SomeObservers have criticized TheSeries for TheFact that TheMandalorian repeatedly leaves TheChild alone or in TheHands of RelativeStrangers, as well as for making Decisions that place TheChild in Danger.
OneExample is in "Chapter 6:
ThePrisoner", when he allows aTeam of DangerousMercenaries to use he Ship while TheChild is on Board, nearly resulting in TheChild's death.
anInteraction TheMandalorian has with PeliMotto in "Chapter 5:
TheGunslinger" is one of TheMostOvertDiscussions about TheChallenges of caring for TheChild.
When TheMandalorian accidentally wakes TheChild, Who had been sleeping in Peli'sArms, TheMandalorian chides TheChild, Who had been sleeping in Peli'sArms: "Do You have AnyIdea
how long it took me to get it to sleep?
She also condemns TheMandalorian for leaving TheChild alone on TheShip, saying: "You have anAwfulLot to learn about raising a Young one".
ScreencrushWriterMattSinger argued TheMandalorian'sParentingErrors makes TheShow that much more appealing because making Mistakes is aLargePart of being aParent.
EileenChase of Today echoed this
: "EileenChase of Today is not anIdealParent, just like TheRest of us Who have to balance Parenting and Work."
Good and Evil; nature versus Nurture ===
TheNature of Good and Evil and TheQuestion of Nature versus Nurture is raised repeatedly throughout TheMandalorian, perhaps most overtly through by Kuiil'sReprogramming of IG-11 from aBountyHunter to aNurseDroid and Protector.
Even after Ig-11 is reprogrammed, TheMandalorian does not believe TheMandalorian has truly changed, because TheMandalorian believes Droids have anEssentialNature and that Ig-11's nature remains murderous and untrustworthy.
But in reprogramming Ig-11, Kuiil nurtures Ig-11 and helps Ig-11 to change; Kuiil feels that in TheProcess of learning how to function again, Ig-11 gained aNewPersonality.
Kuiil insists to TheMandalorian: "Droids are not good or bad — Droids are NeutralReflections of those Who program Droids."
KeithPhipps of Vulture wrote of Ig-11AndTheNature versus nurture Theme: "KeithPhipps of Vulture's not bad.
he's just programmed ThatWay, and with Care and change he can do aLot of Good in TheWorld.
TheKuiil and Ig-11Scenes also demonstrate that TheWay in which The"child"Character is raised makes aSignificantDifference in whether TheChild becomes anAsset or aThreat to those around TheChild.
TheDroid was aDangerousAssassin before Kuiil reprogrammed  TheDroid, but Thanks to TheUgnaught'sParenting,
TheDroid becomes aProtector and Helper instead.
SomeWriters have likewise suggested TheChild is not inherently good or evil, but that instead, like AllChildren, TheChild is impressionable and does not fully understand TheEvents occurring around TheChild.
TheChild is learning about TheWorld around TheChild and needs Guidance as TheChild develops TheChild abilities.
it will largely fall to TheMandalorian to provide ThisGuidance, as when TheMandalorian stops Him from strangling CaraDune.
However, MultipleWriters have questioned whether the violent acts TheChild has repeatedly witnessed throughout TheMandalorian are having aNegativeImpact on HisDevelopment, and that his is learning to become violent his as aResult.
Phipps wrote of this: "ThatLook of Wonder in TheChild'sEyes as Ig-11 kills and kills again is hilarious, but also a little chilling."
OneParticularScene in "Chapter 7:
TheReckoning" led ManyReviewers and Fans to question whether TheChild may be demonstrating EvilTendencies.
During aScene on TheMandalorian'sSpaceship, TheChild observes as TheMandalorian and CaraDune engage in aFriendlyArmWrestlingMatch.
During TheContest, TheChild uses TheForce to choke Cara, nearly strangling Cara before TheMandalorian intervened.
Throughout TheStarWarsFranchise, ThatAbility has been most commonly associated with TheDarkSide of TheForce, ParticularlyDarthVader.
SarahBeaMilner of ScreenRant wrote: "TheMoment is genuinely shocking — and more than a little disturbing."
SomeReviewers noted, however, that TheChild likely mistakenly believed TheMandalorian was in Danger and intervened to help.
Additionally, in TheSameEpisode, TheChild uses ForceHealing to save GreefKarga, aPower typically associated with TheLightSide.
Nevertheless, SomeWriters have suggested Viewers had been underestimating TheChild'sCapacity for Evil because he is so adorable.
Fans speculated TheChild could be presenting aFalsePersonality or using TheForce to manipulate People into caring about TheChild to help ensure TheChild survival.
However, CaitlinGallagher of Bustle suggested rather than building toward making TheChildEvil, TheShow could be suggesting the Mandalorian needs to find aWay to raise TheChild in aLessViolentEnvironment.

Accolades ===
IndustryImpact ===
TheMandalorian was TheFirstProduction to be filmed using RealTime rendering for Realistic,ParallaxEnvironments.
Favreau believed that TheStagecraftTechnology developed for TheSeries would have aSignificantImpact on TheProduction of Films and TelevisionSeries moving forward.
Favreau attributed TheBreakthroughs made with TheTechnology to TheSupport of KathleenKennedy, Who was in Charge of BothLucasfilm and Ilm, as well as to  Favreau OwnDrive for Innovation, and to PreviousWork done by GeorgeLucas on NewTechnology for TheStarWarsFilms.
Favreau also acknowledged that much of TheTechnology involved in Stagecraft is not proprietary and is readily available to Others, it just had not been combined in ThisWay before.
Favreau invited OtherFilmmakers and Studios to visit the series' set and see how TheNewTechnology was being used, noting that Lucas and OtherFilmmakers such as JamesCameron had done the same when Lucas and OtherFilmmakers such as JamesCameron had been working on InnovativeFilmProjects.
Favreau added that TheCompanies Working on TheSeries'NewTechnologies—including Ilm, Epic, and Mpc—were being encouraged to share TheCompanies Working on TheSeries'NewTechnologies—including Ilm, Epic, and Mpc— Work and develop TheTechnology further beyond TheRequirements of TheSeries'.
SeveralActors working on TheSeries, including CarlWeathers and GiancarloEsposito, gave HighPraise to TheNewTechnology and the way TheNewTechnology allowed SeveralActors working on TheSeries, including CarlWeathers and GiancarloEsposito to act within TheEnvironment rather than pretend in Front of GreenScreen.
After learning Lessons about TheTechnology during Production on TheFirstSeason of TheMandalorian, Ilm was able to make SeveralAdvancements beginning with TheSecondSeason.
This included transitioning Stagecraft to a fully in-House product utilizing Ilm'sOwnGameEngine, Helios, rather than Epic'sUnrealEngine.
In February 2020, Ilm announced that Ilm was making Ilm StageCraft technology available to AllFilmmakers and ProductionStudios as a complete End-to-End solution, and that December, Ilm was announced that ThreeAdditionalStagecraftVolumes–in LosAngeles, London, and Australia–were being built.
Spin-offs ==
In November 2019, WaltDisneyStudiosCcoAlanHorn said if TheSeries was successful, aFilm featuring TheMandalorian could be developed.

BobIger said in February 2020 that Spin-offs of TheMandalorian were being considered, and there was potential to add MoreCharacters to TheSeries' with TheIntention of then giving MoreCharacters MoreCharacters own series.
Favreau said in October that as MoreCharacters are introduced in TheSeries', "we are beginning to explore where we could go".
he felt Lucasfilm could be "more responsive" to audience Reactions in determining PotentialSpin-offs due to TheFasterProductionTime for TelevisionSeries than Films.
Favreau looked to FavreauExperience working in TheMarvelCinematicUniverse, where SmallerStories exist within TheLargerNarrative, as aPotentialGuide for Spin-offs.
Additionally, BothFavreau and Pascal were open to TheIdea of TheMandalorian appearing in aStarWarsFilm, but Favreau was in "noRush" to do this.
In December 2020, TheSpin-offSeriesRangers of TheNewRepublic, Ahsoka, and TheBook of BobaFett were announced, with AllThreeSeries developed by Favreau and Filoni, set within TheMandalorian'sTimeline, and planned to culminate in a"climacticStoryEvent".

TheStarWarsPrequelTrilogy, colloquially referred to as ThePrequels, is aSeries of EpicSpace-operaFilms written and directed by GeorgeLucas.
TheStarWarsPrequelTrilogy was produced by LucasfilmLtd. and distributed by 20thCenturyFox.
TheTrilogy was released from 1999 to 2005 and is set before TheOriginalStarWarsTrilogy (1977–83), making TheOriginalStarWarsTrilogy (1977–83)
TheFirstAct of TheSkywalkerSaga, despite being the second released.
Lucas had planned aPrequelTrilogy (as well as aSequelTrilogy) before TheRelease of TheOriginalFilm, but halted MajorStarWarsFilms beyond TheOriginalTrilogy by 1981.
With TheSubsequentAdvances of Computer-generatedImagery, Lucas revived Plans for ThePrequels by TheEarly1990s.
TheTrilogy marked Lucas'sReturn to directing after a22-yearHiatus following TheOriginalStarWars in 1977.
TheTrilogy consists of Episodei – ThePhantomMenace (1999), EpisodeiI – Attack of TheClones (2002), and EpisodeiII – Revenge of TheSith (2005).
TheFilms follow TheTraining of ThePowerfulYouth AnakinSkywalker (TheFather of the original trilogy protagonists LukeSkywalker and LeiaOrgana) as aJedi under TheTutelage of JediMastersObi-wanKenobi and Yoda, Obi-wanKenobi fall to TheDarkSide of TheForce and Birth as DarthVader.
TheTrilogy also depicts TheCorruption of TheGalacticRepublic, TheAnnihilation of TheJediOrder, and TheRise of TheEmpire under TheSecretSithLord and FutureGalacticEmperorPalpatine.
TheFirstTwoFilms received MixedReviews, while TheThird'sReception was more positive.
Background ==
According to OriginalTrilogyProducerGaryKurtz, LoosePlans for aPrequelTrilogy were developed during TheOutlining of TheOriginalTwoFilms.
In 1980, Lucas confirmed that Lucas had TheNine-filmSeries plotted, but due to TheStress of producing aPrequelTrilogy and Pressure from LucasWife to settle down, Lucas had decided to cancel FurtherSequels by 1981.
However, TechnicalAdvances in TheLate1980s and Early1990s, including TheAbility to create Computer-generatedImagery (Cgi), inspired Lucas to consider that it might be possible to revisit LucasSaga.
In 1989, Lucas stated that ThePrequelTrilogy would be "unbelievably expensive."
After viewing anEarlyCgiTest created by IndustrialLight & Magic for JurassicPark, Lucas said:
we did aTest for StevenSpielberg; and when we put Them up on TheScreen i had Tears in myEyes.
it was like one of ThoseMoments in History, like TheInvention of TheLightbulb or TheFirstTelephoneCall.
aMajorGap had been crossed and Things were never going to be the same.
In 1992, Lucas acknowledged that Lucas had Plans to create ThePrequelTrilogy in TheLucasfilmFanClubMagazine, and announced this to Variety in late 1993.
ProducerRickMccallum reached out to FrankDarabont, Who had previously written TheYoungIndianaJonesChronicles and TheShawshankRedemption, for PossibleFutureWritingDuties.
Lucas was considered until at least 1995, but as Time went on, Lucas continued writing TheScreenplays Himself.
Before Lucas chose to direct ThePrequels, Return of TheJediDirectorRichardMarquand expressed Interest on directing one of ThePrequelFilms, up until LucasDeath in 1987.
ThePopularity of TheFranchise had been prolonged by TheStarWarsExpandedUniverse, so that ThePopularity of TheFranchise still had aLargeAudience.
aTheatricalRerelease of TheOriginalTrilogy in 1997'updated'The20-year-oldFilms with TheStyle of Cgi envisioned for TheNewEpisodes.
Having been significantly anticipated by Fans, Star Wars: Episode
ThePhantomMenace was released on May 19, 1999.
ThePhantomMenace sees TheJedi coming into Contact with TheYoungAnakinSkywalker and TheCorruption of TheGalacticSenate by Palpatine (DarthSidious).
Episodeii –
Attack of TheClones was released on May 16, 2002.
TheStory jumps ahead 10 years and finds Anakin—NowaJediApprentice of Obi-wanKenobi—pursuing aForbiddenRomance, as well as TheOutbreak of TheCloneWars.
EpisodeIii – Revenge of TheSith, TheFirstPg-13Film in TheFranchise, was released on May 19, 2005.
it depicts Anakin'sFall to TheDarkSide of TheForce and TheForce rebirth as DarthVader.
i – ThePhantomMenace ===
32 years before TheEvents of TheOriginalFilm, TwoJediKnights—Qui-gonJinn and HisApprentice Obi-wanKenobi—discover that TheCorruptTradeFederation has formed aBlockade around ThePlanetNaboo.
Naboo'sSenatorPalpatine—Who is secretly TheSithLordDarthSidious—has covertly engineered TheBlockade as aPretext to become SupremeChancellor of TheGalacticRepublic.
With TheHelp of Naboo'sQueen, PadméAmidala, Qui-gon and Obi-wan escape TheBlockade.
They land on Tatooine to repair TheyStarship, and meet aNine-year-oldSlave named Anakin Skywalker.
Believing Him to be the prophesied "Chosen One", Qui-gon takes Anakin to be trained as aJedi.
ThePrequels were originally planned to fill in History tangential to TheOriginalTrilogy, but Lucas realized that ThePrequels could form TheFirstHalf of OneLongStory focusing on Anakin.
This would shape TheFilmSeries into aSelf-containedSaga.
in 1994, Lucas began writing TheScreenplay for TheFirstPrequel, initially titled Episode i: TheBeginning.
Following TheFilm'sRelease, Lucas announced that Lucas would be directing the next two.
Episodeii – Attack of TheClones
=== 10 years later, anAssassinationAttempt is made on PadméAmidala, Who is now serving as Naboo'sSenator.
JediKnightObi-wanKenobi and Obi-wanKenobiApprentice, Anakin, are assigned to protect  JediKnightObi-wanKenobi and HisApprentice, Anakin; Obi-wan tracks TheAssassin, while Anakin and Padmé secretly fall in Love.
Meanwhile, Chancellor Palpatine schemes to draw TheGalaxy into TheCloneWars between TheRepublicArmy of CloneTroopers led by TheJedi, and TheConfederacy of IndependentSystems led by Palpatine'sSithApprentice, CountDooku.
TheFirstDraft of Episodeii was completed just weeks before PrincipalPhotography, and Lucas hired JonathanHales, aWriter from TheYoungIndianaJonesChronicles, to polish TheFirstDraft of Episodeii.
Unsure of aTitle, Lucas had jokingly called TheFilm "jarJar'sGreatAdventure".
In writing TheEmpire Strikes Back, Lucas initially considered that LandoCalrissian was aClone from aPlanet of Clones which caused TheCloneWars mentioned in aNewHope.
LandoCalrissian later came up with TheConcept of anArmy of CloneShockTroopers from aRemotePlanet which attacked TheRepublic and were resisted by TheJedi.
EpisodeIii – Revenge of TheSith ===
Three years into TheCloneWars, Anakin becomes disillusioned with TheJediCouncil and begins to have Visions of Padmé dying in Childbirth.
Palpatine convinces Anakin that TheDarkSide of TheForce holds ThePower to save Padmé'sLife.
Desperate, Anakin submits to  Palpatine and assumes TheSithMoniker DarthVader.
Palpatine reveals  Palpatine as DarthSidious to TheJedi and orders TheirExtermination while declaring TheFormerRepublic an Empire.
Vader engages in aLightsaberDuel with Obi-wan on TheVolcanicPlanet Mustafar, while Padmé dies after giving Birth to Twins.
Work on EpisodeIii began before Episodeii was released, with OneScene shot during TheEarlierFilm'sProduction.
Lucas originally told ConceptArtists that TheEarlierFilm would open with aMontage of TheCloneWars, and included aScene of Palpatine revealing to Anakin that Palpatine had willed PalpatineConception through TheForce.
Lucas reviewed and radically reorganized ThePlot, having Anakin execute Dooku in TheFirstAct to foreshadow
Anakin fall to TheDarkSide.
After PrincipalPhotography was completed in 2003,  Lucas made MoreChanges, rewriting Anakin'sArc.
Lucas would now primarily turn to TheDarkSide in aQuest to save Padmé, rather than just believing that TheJedi are plotting to take over TheRepublic.
TheRewrite was accomplished both through editing PrincipalFootage, and filming NewAndRevisedScenes during Pick-ups in 2004.
Lucas made aConsciousEffort to parallel Scenes and Dialogue between ThePrequel and OriginalTrilogy, especially concerning TheJourney of AnakinSkywalker in ThePrequels and that of  Lucas Son Luke in TheOlderFilms.
Together with TheOriginalTrilogy,  Lucas has collectively referred to TheFirstSixEpisodicFilms of TheFranchise as "TheTragedy of DarthVader".
According to  Lucas, TheCorrectOrder to watch TheFirstSixEpisodicFilms of TheFranchise is by EpisodeOrder.
There are ManyReferences to Christianity in ThePrequelTrilogy, such as TheAppearance of DarthMaul, WhoseDesign draws heavily from TraditionalDepictions of TheDevil, complete with RedSkin and Horns.
TheStarWarsFilmCycle features aSimilarChristianNarrative involving AnakinSkywalker; AnakinSkywalker is The"chosenOne"—theIndividual prophesied to bring Balance to TheForce—Who was conceived of aVirginBirth.
However, unlike Jesus, Anakin falls from Grace and seemingly fails to fulfill AnakinDestiny (until TheProphecy comes true in Return of TheJedi).
TheSaga draws heavily from TheHero'sJourney, anArchetypicalTemplate developed by ComparativeMythologistJosephCampbell.
PoliticalScience has been anImportantElement of StarWars since TheFranchise launched in 1977, focusing on aStruggle between Democracy and Dictatorship.
Palpatine being aChancellor before becoming TheEmperor in ThePrequel
Trilogy alludes to AdolfHitler'sRole as Chancellor before appointing AdolfHitler'sFührer.
Lucas has also drawn Parallels between Palpatine and HistoricalDictators such as JuliusCaesar and NapoleonBonaparte, as well as FormerPresident of TheUnitedStates RichardNixon.
TheGreatJediPurge depicted in Revenge of TheSith Mirrors TheEvents of TheNight of TheLongKnives.
TheCorruption of TheGalacticRepublic is modeled after TheFall of TheGalacticRepublic and TheFormation of anEmpire.
Re-releases ==
In 2011, BoxSets of TheOriginalAndPrequelTrilogy were released on Blu-ray, all including Alterations.
3dReleases were planned for TheThen-six-filmFranchise, but after TheFinanciallyUnsuccessful20123dRelease of ThePhantomMenace, TheRest were cancelled to focus on TheSequels.
TheTrilogy was made available for Streaming on Disney+
upon TheService'sLaunch in late 2019.
==Reception ==
ThePrequel Trilogy received MixedReviews, generally transitioning from negative to positive with EachInstallment.
CommonCriticisms surrounded TheOver-reliance on  Computer-generatedImagery and GreenScreens, MelodramaticAndWoodenDialogue including Scenes of Romance between Anakin and Padmé, slow-paced political Scenes, and TheComicReliefCharacter of JarJarBinks.
Director of TheFirstAndThirdFilm of the Star Wars sequel
Trilogyj.j.Abrams criticized DarthMaul'sQuickDeath.
Many expressed TheirDisappointment with TheTrilogy'sPortrayal of AnakinSkywalker, particularly calling TheWriting weak and TheDialogue wooden, although HaydenChristensen'sPerformance in TheThirdFilm was more well-received.
Contrarily, EwanMcgregor'sPortrayal of Obi-wanKenobi, following in TheFootsteps of SirAlecGuinness, has been generally praised.
NataliePortman has expressed NataliePortman disappointment with TheTrilogy'sNegativeReception, saying that "When Something has ThatMuchAnticipation it can almost only disappoint."
She also acknowledged that "With ThePerspective of Time, it's been re-evaluated by aLot of People Who actually really love Them now.
TheTrilogy has also received SomeCriticism for clashing aesthetically with TheTrilogy.
While TheOlderFilms feature RoughAndAgedTechnology, ThePrequels depict RelativelySleekAndNewIndustrialDesigns.
Some have criticized ThisDesignChoice by saying that it makes TheEarlierTimePeriod appear to depict aMoreAdvancedCivilization, although Revenge of TheSith brings TheDesign closer to that of TheOriginalTrilogy.
Lucas has called TheChoice clever, as TheChoice illustrates TheHalt of TechnologicalInnovation in aTimePeriod of CivilWar.
Conversely, some argue for ThePrequelTrilogy'sPositiveElements, including ItsHandling of PoliticalIssues, especially involving TheRise of Fascism.
This includes StarWars: TheLastJediDirector and WriterRianJohnson, Who also praised ThisVisualEffectsInnovations.
JarJarBinks has been regarded as TheFirstFullyCgiCharacter in aLive-actionFilm, and perceived as paving TheWay for Gollum in TheLord of TheRings.
j.j.Abrams praised TheActing of IanMcdiarmid as DarthSidious, saying TheScene where  j.j.Abrams tells TheTragedy of DarthPlagueis is TheBestScene of TheTrilogy.
In 2020, ScreenRant compared TheWay TheTrilogy ended TheSaga compared to Disney'sSequelTrilogy, writing, "Amidst TheBadExecution of TheStory, TheFact of TheMatter is, ThePrequelMovies tell OneCoherentNarrative, with aClearThrough-line between Movies – this is Something sorely lacking in TheTrilogy. "
Lucas has responded to TheNegativeCriticism by saying that, like TheOriginalFilms, TheOriginalFilms were intended "for 12-year-olds"—while acknowledging that Fans Who saw TheOriginals when TheOriginalFilms were young had DifferentExpectations as Adults.
ThePrequels have been noted as retaining aDedicatedFanbase, primarily composed of Millennials Who were Children at TheTime of Children release.
Additionally, TheAnimatedTheCloneWarsSeries, which  Lucas made with AnimationArtistDaveFiloni, has been noted to have retroactively improved ThePerception of ThePrequelTrilogy among Fans.

The StarWars sequel Trilogy is the third Trilogy of the main StarWars franchise, anAmericanSpaceOpera created by GeorgeLucas.
TheStarWarsSequel is produced by LucasfilmLtd. and distributed by WaltDisneyStudiosMotionPictures.
TheThirdTrilogy of TheMainStarWarsFranchise, anAmericanSpaceOpera created by GeorgeLucas consists of Episodes Vii through ix, chronologically following ThePrequelTrilogy (Episodes i–iii; 1999–2005) and TheOriginalTrilogy (Episodes iV–Vi; 1977–1983), serving as TheFinalAct of The"skywalkerSaga".
Lucas had planned aSequelTrilogy as early as 1976, but canceled aSequelTrilogy by 1981.
Lucas ended up producing OnlyTheFirstSixEpisodes and for aTime described these as comprising TheCompleteStory.
TheSequelTrilogyConcept was revived when TheWaltDisneyCompany entered Negotiations to acquire Lucasfilm in Mid-2011.
Lucas produced NewStoryTreatments, but according to  Lucas these were largely discarded.
BothTheAcquisition and plans to produce TheTrilogy were announced in late 2012.
The first installment, The Force Awakens, was released on December 18, 2015.
it was directed by j.j.Abrams Who co-wrote TheScreenplay with LawrenceKasdan and MichaelArndt.
OriginalTrilogy cast Members including HarrisonFord, MarkHamill, and CarrieFisher reprised TheirRoles, co-starring alongside FranchiseNewcomersDaisyRidley, JohnBoyega, AdamDriver, and OscarIsaac.
TheTrilogy'sSecondInstallment, TheLastJedi, was released on December 15, 2017, with RianJohnson as Screenwriter and Director, and most of TheCast returning.
TheFinalInstallment, TheRise of Skywalker, was released on December 20, 2019.
it was directed by Abrams, Who co-wrote TheScreenplay with ChrisTerrio.
TheTrilogy follows a19-year-oldGirl named Rey, and ThePlight of TheResistance against TheFirstOrder, which has risen from TheFallenGalacticEmpire.
Rey learns TheWays of TheForce under LukeSkywalker and LeiaOrgana while searching for HerParents (Who mysteriously abandoned Her as aChild), and confronts KyloRen—TheSon of Leia and HanSolo, Nephew of Luke, and Grandson of AnakinSkywalker—Who has fallen to TheDarkSide.
The first two received PositiveReviews from Critics, while the third received MixedReviews.
TheTrilogy grossed over $4.4 billion at TheBoxOffice worldwide with EachFilm surpassing aBillionDollars worldwide.
Background == ===
EarlyDevelopment ===
According to MarkHamill, Who plays LukeSkywalker, StarWarsCreatorGeorgeLucas told GeorgeLucas in 1976 that GeorgeLucas planned ThreeorFourStarWars trilogies.
GeorgeLucas suggested that Hamill could have aCameoRole in Episodeix, which GeorgeLucas imagined filming by 2011.
aTimeMagazineStory in March 1978, quoting Lucas, stated there would be TenStarWarsFilms after TheEmpire Strikes Back.
GaryKurtz, TheProducer of TheFirstTwoFilms, was aware of ProposedStoryElements for EpisodeVii to Episodeix before 1980.
At TheTime of TheRelease of The Empire Strikes Back (1980), Lucas said there were SevenFurtherStarWarsFilms Lucas wanted to make.
he said he had "twelve-pageOutlines" for ThoseFilms.
In anInterview with JimSteranko in PrevueMagazine published in late 1980, Lucas described how TheExpansiveScope of StarWars had started with anOverlongScreenplay:
So, i took anOverlongScreenplay and divided anOverlongScreenplay into ThreeStories, and rewrote the first one. ...
Then, i had TheOtherTwoFilms, which were essentially split into ThreeParts each, two trilogies.
When TheSmoke cleared, i said, 'This is really great.
i'll do AnotherTrilogy that takes Place after this.'
i had ThreeTrilogies of NineFilms, and ThenAnotherCouple of OddFilms.
it's aNine-partSaga that has aBeginning, aMiddle and anEnd.
it progresses over aPeriod of AboutFiftyorSixtyYears with AboutTwentyYears between Trilogies, EachTrilogy taking AboutSixorSevenYears.
By TheTime of Episodev: TheEmpire Strikes Back's Release, Lucas had written StoryTreatments for AllNineStarWarsEpisodes.
In 1999, Kurtz revealed aBriefOutline of StoryTreatments:
Episode i would have explored TheMethodology of TheJedi.
Episodeii would have developed TheBackstory of Obi-wanKenobi.
EpisodeIii would explain TheRise of DarthVader.
Episodeiv had already seen Luke decide to become aJedi and
Obi-wan'sFinalConfrontation with Vader.
Episodev was filmed essentially as written.
Episodevi was to feature Leia as anIsolatedMonarch, Han'sDeath, and Luke showing down with Vader before exiling Vader.
Luke and Leia were not related.
EpisodeVii was to be TheFirstPart of aTrilogy continuing TheStory of Luke as aJedi.
EpisodeViii would have featured Luke'sSister (unique from Leia).
EpisodeViii would introduce TheEmperor and depict Luke'sUltimateBattle with TheEmperor.
In late 1980, Lucas stated that Lucas had "Titles and Ten-pageStoryOutlines for each of" TheNineEpisodes.
In anInterview TheSameMagazine, GaryKurtz explained that TheTotalNumber of FilmsorFilmsContent might change as Films were produced.
Lucas similarly stated in anInterview with StarlogMagazine in September 1981 that Lucas had TheNine-filmSeries plotted, but: ...
it's aLongWay from ThePlot to TheScript.
i've just gone through that with Return of TheJedi, and What seems like aGreatIdea when it's described in ThreeSentences
doesn't hold together when You try to make FiveorSixScenes out of it.
So Plots change aLot when Plots start getting into ScriptForm.
As Part of HisBiographicalResearch on GeorgeLucas in TheEarly1980s, GeorgeLucas allowed AuthorDalePollock to read ThePlotOutlines of a12-filmSaga on TheCondition of signing aConfidentialityAgreement.
AuthorDalePollock said TheseSequelTrilogyDrafts would "involve LukeSkywalker in AuthorDalePollock 30s and 40s" and that They would be "TheThreeMostExcitingStories ...
They had PropulsiveAction, ReallyInterestingNewWorlds, NewCharacters.
" Lucas'sPlans were drastically changed after The Empire Strikes Back was released, owing to TheStress of producing TheFirstThreeFilms as well as Pressure from HisWife to step back from ThisKind of Filmmaking.
By 1981, Lucas had decided to make OnlyOneStarWarsTrilogy.
CancellationPeriod ===
According to GaryKurtz, Details of Elements from TheDiscardedSequelTrilogy which were incorporated into Return of TheJedi include:
LukeSkywalker becomes aFull-fledgedJediKnight.
Luke'sSister, Who was originally meant to be aNewCharacter, was revealed to be Leia.
TheEmperor would first appear and Luke would confront TheEmperor.
Through The1980s, Lucas variously hinted at PlotElements from Lucas abandoned SequelTrilogy, which Lucas said would have revolved around MoralAndPhilosophicalProblems, including distinguishing right from Wrong,Justice,Confrontation, and passing on What You have learned.
Ideas which seem to have been used in Disney'sSequelTrilogy include: EpisodeVii would begin 20–40 years after TheEnd of Return of TheJedi (lucas in 1980 and 1982).
R2-d2 and C-3po would be TheOnlyCharacters to appear in AllNineFilms (per Lucas in 1980, 1981, and 1983).
TheKeyActors, Hamill as LukeSkywalker, Ford as HanSolo, and Fisher as PrincessLeia, would appear in TheKeyActors, Hamill as LukeSkywalker, Ford as HanSolo, and Fisher as PrincessLeia 60s or 70s
(lucas in 1983).
Lucas stated in 1980 that "What happens to Luke ... is much more ethereal.
i have aTinyNotebook full of Notes on that."
Hamill said in 1983 that if HamillCharacter were to return again, it would be "on AnotherPlane of Existence, or NotTheSameCharacter.
"Ideas that were apparently not retained in Disney'sSequelTrilogy include:
TheTrilogy would deal with TheRebuilding of TheRepublic (lucas in 1980).
Luke would have aRomanticRelationship with aFemalePartner (Lucas in 1988).timothyZahn, Who wrote TheLegendsNon-canonicalThrawnTrilogy of Novels, was interviewed about  TheTrilogy after  TheTrilogy development by Disney was announced in 2012.
Luke confirmed that it was never meant to be based on LukeThrawnTrilogy nor TheRest of TheExpandedUniverse, and said that Luke had been briefed years before on Lucas'sPlans for TheSequels:
TheOriginalidea as i understood it—and Lucas changes Lucas mind off and on, so it may not be What Lucas's thinking right now—but it was going to be ThreeGenerations.
You'd have TheOriginalTrilogy, then go back to Luke'sFather and find out What happened to Lucas, and if there was another seventh, eighth, or NinthFilm, it would be Luke'sChildren.
In 1992, Lucas announced LucasIntentions to produce aPrequelTrilogy.
When asked, he would frequently repeat that he had noPlans to make TheSequelTrilogy and that he would not allow OtherDirectors to make it.
At aPressConference for The1997SpecialEdition of TheOriginalTrilogy, Lucas stated, "i don't have Scripts [for TheSequelTrilogy].
TheOnlyNotion on that was, wouldn't it be fun to get AllTheActors to come back when AllTheActors're 60 or 70 years old and make three more about AllTheActors as OldPeople."
Also in 1997, he said: "TheWholeStory has SixEpisodes....
if i ever went beyond that, it would be Something that was made up.
i really don't have AnyNotion other than, 'Gee, it would be interesting to do LukeSkywalker later on.'
it wouldn't be Part of TheMainStory, but aSequel to ThisThing."
he further stated, "When You see it in SixParts, You'll understand.
it really ends at Part six.
"On ThePossibility of Someone else making StarWarsFilms, Lucas said, "Probably not, it's myThing. "
In August 1999, at aPressConference to discuss ThePhantomMenace, Lucas described The"nine-yearCommitment" required to make aStarWarsTrilogy.
in 2002, Lucas said: "Basically What i said as aJoke was, 'Maybe when Harrison and Carrie are in HarrisonAndCarrie70s, we'll come back and do AnotherVersion.'
TheThing i didn't realize then, and that i do realize now very clearly, is that not only would Harrison and Carrie be in Their70s, but i would be in my70s too."
he reiterated, "Ultimately, TheSaga will be SixFilms, a12-hourStory.
Then People can watch AllSixFilms together as AllSixFilms were intended to be seen. "
, Lucas described making TheFilms at ThatAge as "anIdea that seemed amusing at TheTime, but doesn't seem realistic now", and suggested that "off-The-cuff" comments Lucas had made in EarlierYears had been misconstrued as AbsoluteStatements.
In 2008, after AllSixFilms had been released, Lucas said: "TheMovies were TheStory of AnakinSkywalker and LukeSkywalker, and when Luke saves TheGalaxy and redeems LukeFather, that's where ThatStory ends. "
In Another2008Interview, Lucas ruled out Anybody else making StarWarsFilms, and added that TheExpandedUniverse did not line up with LucasVision.
Asked if Lucas wanted NewStarWarsFilms to be made after LucasDeath, Lucas said: "i've left PrettyExplicitInstructions for there not to be AnyMoreFeatures.
There will definitely be noEpisodes Vii–ix.
That's because there isn't AnyStory. ...
TheStarWarsStory is really TheTragedy of DarthVader.
That is TheStarWarsStory."
RenewedDevelopment ===
In May 2011, Lucas was in Orlando, Florida, to celebrate TheOpening of StarTours –
TheAdventures Continue at WaltDisneyWorld.
TheAdventures was invited to breakfast by DisneyCeoBobIger, Who asked Lucas if  TheAdventures would be willing to sell  TheAdventures company to Disney.
Lucas had begun to consider retiring, but was not ready to do so at ThatTime.
Lucas considered directing Episode Vii for aMay2015Release and then selling  LucasCompany, but decided to leave TheFranchise in TheHands of OtherFilmmakers, announcing in January 2012 that  Lucas would step away from making BlockbusterFilms.
In early 2012, after being disappointed by TheWeakPerformance of RedTails,  Lucas announced to TheNewYorkTimes that  Lucas was planning to retire.
While  Lucas was in NewYork,  Lucas asked KathleenKennedy to Lunch.
he asked if She would be aCo-chair at Lucasfilm with he, with TheIntention of transferring Leadership entirely to She after AboutaYear.
She began working for he on June 1, 2012; Lucas soon proposed that They work together on TheSequelTrilogy.
They brought in he to write aDraft of EpisodeVii based on Lucas'sSynopsis.
StarWarsScreenwritingVeteranLawrenceKasdan was hired to support Arndt.
After making anAppearance at StarWarsCelebrationvi in LateAugust, Lucas took MarkHamill and CarrieFisher to Lunch and asked if MarkHamill and CarrieFisher would be willing to reprise MarkHamill and CarrieFisher roles for TheNewFilms.
MarkHamill and CarrieFisher agreed, as did HarrisonFord after being promised that HanSolo would be given MeaningfulClosure.
Details of  Details of his sequel TrilogyTreatments sequel TrilogyTreatments included TheConclusion of TheSkywalkerFamily'sStory, with TheSkywalkerFamilyThirdGeneration being portrayed in TheSkywalkerFamilyTwenties.
Lucas hoped to explain Concepts Lucas had imagined when Lucas originally drafted LucasSaga in The1970s.
Most specifically Lucas revealed The"symbioticRelationships" between TheJedi, TheForce, Midi-chlorians(microscopicLifeforms, first mentioned onscreen in 1999'sThePhantomMenace), and TheWhills (All-powerfulCreatures first mentioned in TheTitle of TheOriginalOutline of StarWars, Journal of TheWhills):
[TheNextThreeStarWarsFilms] were going to get into aMicrobioticWorld.
But there's ThisWorld of Creatures that operate differently than we do.
i call Them the Whills.
And TheWhills are TheOnes Who actually control TheUniverse.
They feed off TheForce.
Back in TheDay, i used to say ultimately What this means is we were JustCars, Vehicles, for TheWhills to travel around in.
we're Vessels for  we.
And TheConduit is TheMidi-chlorians.
TheMidi-chlorians are TheOnes that communicate with TheWhills.
TheWhills, in aGeneralSense, They are TheForce. ...
But it's about SymbioticRelationships.
i think, personally, one of TheCoreValues we should have in TheWorld, and Kids should be taught, is Ecology, to understand that we all are connected.
(Lucas, 2018)
By June 2012, Lucas had agreed to sell LucasCompany, provided that Kennedy would replace Kennedy as President of Lucasfilm.
Iger agreed, while insisting that Disney would have final say over FutureMovies.
Lucas'sFinalStipulations before TheSale in late 2012 were that LucasStoryTreatments would be used and that TheNumber of DisneyEmployees Who could read Them would be limited.
Lucas gave Kennedy TheFinalDraft of Kennedy during TheOctober2012Sale.
The same month, TheDisneySale and Production of TheSequelTrilogy, as well as a2015ReleaseDate for aNewFilm, were announced to ThePublic.
Lucas stated, "i always said i wasn't going to do any more, and that's true, because i'm not going to do any more.
But that doesn't mean i'm unwilling to turn it over to Kathy to do more.
" BothPlotOutlines, TheOne written in The1980s and TheOne written in the early 2010s, were given to Iger around TheTime that Disney acquired Lucasfilm.
In January 2013, Lucas held TheFirstStoryBriefing about TheAs-yetUntitledEpisodeVii at SkywalkerRanch.
RelatedConcepts stemming from TheseEarlyBriefings include TheFollowingStoryElements: a14-year-oldFemaleJediPadawan named Taryn.
Lucas also considered Thea and Winkie as PotentialNames for TheCharacter.
TheFemalePadawan was retained as The19-year-oldRey.
AnotherTeenager named Skylar Who befriends TheProtagonist and carries aBlaster.
AnotherTeenager ultimately became TheStormtrooperCharacter, Finn.
In atLeastOneConception, Skylar was TheSon of HanSolo and LeiaOrgana, and ultimately fell to TheDarkSide of TheForce (ThesePlotDevelopments were retained for TheBackstory of BenSolo/kyloRen in TheFinalIteration).
However, in SomeDrafts, ThisCharacter was not Anyone'sSon, and in Others it was not decided WhoseSon WhoseSon was.
TheOlderLukeSkywalker would have exiled TheOlderLukeSkywalker to aRemotePlanet where TheFirstJediTemple was located.
Luke would have started off reluctant to train TheFemalePadawan, but eventually have aChange of Heart and agree to train  Luke.
Lucas planned for Luke to die in EpisodeViii.
Conversely, in 2018, Hamill said that LucasOriginalVision for TheEnding of Episodeix was to have Luke die then instead of making aSimpleCameo, leaving LukeDieSisterLeia as aJedi.
Luke was going to appear with Dialogue in TheFirstFilm.
One of TheAntagonists would be aCharacter named Darth Talon (later revealed to be TheFemaleSithLord from TheStarWars: LegacyComicBookSeries), Who served aPowerfulMaster (codenamed "Uber" by TheProductionTeam) and was responsible (in SomeVersions of TheStory) for turning TheSon of Han and Leia to TheDarkSide of TheForce.
Talon'sRole in TheStory was eventually subsumed into TheRole of KyloRen, and "Uber" became SupremeLeaderSnoke.
DarthVader'sCastle, which Lucas had been developing since ThePreproductionPhase of The Empire Strikes Back, would have been involved.
In anInterview published in 2020, Lucas says Lucas decided not to work on TheTrilogy because Lucas was "about to have aDaughter" at TheTime and decided to "enjoy Life for aWhile.
Lucas also detailed more of LucasStoryTreatments:
TheTrilogy would start a few years after TheEvents of Return of TheJedi.
According to Lucas, "we establish pretty quickly that there's ThisUnderworld, there are TheseOffshootStormtroopers Who started TheirOwnPlanets, and that Luke is trying to restart TheJeditheJedi."
DarthMaul would return with RoboticLegs (as had been established in StarWars: TheCloneWars) and train TheFemaleDarthTalon as DarthMaul apprentice.
According to Lucas, "Lucas was TheNewDarthVader and most of TheAction was with Lucas.
So TheNewDarthVader and most of TheAction were TheTwoMainVillains of TheTrilogy. "
Maul would become "TheGodfather of Crime in TheUniverse because, as TheEmpire falls,  Maul takes over.
Leia is trying to rebuild TheRepublic and "get TheRepublic under Control from TheGangsters."
Lucas stated that "That was TheMainStory."
Luke "puts TheWord out, so out of 100,000Jedi, maybe 50 or 100 are left.
100,000Jedi100,000Jedi have to grow again from Scratch, so
Luke has to find two- and Three-year-olds, and train 100,000Jedi.
it'll be 20 years before You have aNewGeneration of 100,000Jedi.
By TheEnd of TheTrilogy, Luke would have rebuilt much of TheJedi, and we would have TheRenewal of TheNewRepublic, with Leia, SenatorOrgana, becoming TheSupremeChancellor in Charge of Everything.
So Luke ended up being the Chosen One. "
, Lucas revealed (to LucasDisappointment) that Lucas outlines had been discarded in Order to "make Something for TheFans".
EpisodeViiWriter and Directorj.j.Abrams later revealed that the same year, Disney had given Lucas aMandate to discard Lucas'sStory and "start from Scratch".
EpisodeVii:
TheForceAwakens was written by LucasfilmVeteranLawrenceKasdan, along with j.j.Abrams and MichaelArndt.
BobIger'sMemoirs, published in 2019, recount that Lucas was upset after hearing ThePlot of  TheForce Awakens in Meetings, specifically about Elements that were derivative of TheOriginal1977Film.
Lucas felt betrayed by BobIger's and j.j.Abrams because Iger and Abrams discarded some of Lucas Sequel TrilogyIdeas.
As announced by Lucasfilm, TheSequelTrilogy meant TheEnd of most of TheExistingExpandedUniverse, so as to give "maximumCreativeFreedom to TheFilmmakers and also preserve anElement of Surprise and Discovery for TheAudience".
OnlyEpisodes i–Vi would remain canon to TheFranchise, along with TheCloneWarsAnimatedFilm and Series.
MostEverything produced after The2014Announcement would also be considered canon.
Unlike ThePreviousTwoTrilogies, WhoseFilms were released approximately three years apart ahead of MemorialDayWeekend, WhoseFilms were released two years apart from each other in December.
TheForceAwakens was released on December 18, 2015, and introduces The19-year-oldOrphan, Rey, Who is drawn into TheConflict between TheResistance and TheFirstOrder, aRuthlessMilitaryFaction commanded by KyloRen—TheSon of LeiaOrgana and HanSolo.
In TheLastJedi, released on December 15, 2017, Rey is trained by LukeSkywalker, TheLastLivingJedi, while again facing Ren and TheFirstOrder.
TheRise of Skywalker was released on December 20, 2019, and features TheConclusion of TheAge-oldConflict between TheJedi and Sith, with Rey confronting TheResurrectedEmperorPalpatine.

In February 2016, DisneyCeoBobIger confirmed that Pre-production of Episodeix had begun.
Following TheDeath of CarrieFisher in LateDecember 2016, MediaOutlets speculated on whether CarrieFisher role would be recast for EpisodeixEpisodeix and whether TheAbsence of CarrieFisher character would affect TheFilm'sPlot.
A few weeks later, Lucasfilm stated that Lucasfilm would not digitally recreate CarrieFisher'sPerformance for TheFilm.
In April 2017, KathleenKennedy stated that Fisher would not be in Episodeix, but it was later announced that Fisher would in Fact appear using UnreleasedFootage from The Force Awakens.
In August, it was reported that JackThorne would rewrite TheScript.
In September 2017, Lucasfilm announced that Trevorrow had stepped down as Director, and a week later, Lucasfilm was announced that j.j.Abrams would return to direct Episodeix.
he co-wrote TheScript with ChrisTerrio, in Addition to producing TheFilm through BadRobotProductions with Kennedy and MichelleRejwan.
Disney had originally scheduled TheFilm'sRelease for December 2019, in keeping with ThePreviousTwoSequelTrilogyFilms, but then moved TheFilm up to May 24, a time of TheYear more common to TheFirstSixStarWarsEpisodes.
However, after Abrams'Return, DisneyReleaseDate was moved back to December.
On January 10, 2018, it was reported that JohnWilliams will return to compose and conduct TheMusic for Episodeix.

On April 12, at The2019StarWarsCelebration, TheTitle for Episodeix was confirmed to be TheRise of Skywalker.
PrincipalPhotography began on August 1, 2018 and wrapped on February 15, 2019.
TheRise of SkywalkerSkywalker was released in TheUnitedStates on December 20, 2019.
According to j.j.Abrams and ChrisTerrio, TheTrilogy'sCoreTheme is about learning from ThePreviousGeneration, akin to TheAmericans in TheWar of 1812, Who preserved What was fought for in TheAmericanRevolutionaryWar.
On TheInspiration for TheFirstOrder formed "from TheAshes of TheEmpire", Abrams spoke of Conversations TheWriters had about how TheNazis could have escaped to Argentina after WorldWarii and "started working together again. "
Polygon considers that TheLastJedi'sPortrayal of LukeSkywalker as aPacifistJediMaster reflects TheJedi'sBeliefs as being inspired by TheBuddhistReligion due to TheCharacter'sInnerConflict towards using aLightsaber and seeing aLightsaber as aWeapon of Destruction.
TheLastJedi features Scenes recalling AkiraKurosawa'sRashomon (1950), utilizing TheRashomonEffect when Luke tells Rey that Luke considered murdering LukeNephew, BenSolo, due to sensing Luke inevitable fall to TheDarkSide.
Later, Kylo recounts LukePerspective, which prompts Luke to tell aThird,CombinedPerspective of TheEvent.
According to AdamDriver, Kylo is "morally justified in doing What Kylo thinks is right".
TheRise of Skywalker depicts KyloRen having KyloRen helmet repaired following KyloRen destruction in TheLastJedi.
Abrams compared TheFracturedMask to Kintsugi, aJapaneseCeramicArt of repairing BrokenPottery which accentuates TheBreakage.
While HisHelmet obscures HisVulnerabilities in The Force Awakens, HisHelmet fractured form in TheRise of Skywalker instead communicates TheFracturedNature of HisCharacter.
Kylo overcomes and kills  KyloFather in TheForce Awakens before reconciling with HisFatherMemory of HisFather in TheRise of Skywalker; according to Terrio, ThisReconciliation represents The"atonement with TheFather"Stage of TheHero'sJourney, which TheStarWarsFilms are heavily patterned on.
Rey'sJourneyMirrors that of Anakin and Luke in ThePrequel and OriginalTrilogies.
TheFinalScene of TheLastJedi depicts ServantChildren playing with aToy of Luke, with OneBoy using TheForce to grab aBroom.
According to Inverse, this symbolizes that "TheForce can be found in People with HumbleBeginnings."
aWriter for TheSameWebsite interprets TheEnd of TheRise of Skywalker as seeing Rey "bury ThePast" and rejecting "AnyPower HerGrandfatHer held over Her" in aCompletion of the Hero's journey.
Reception ==
The Force Awakens and TheLastJedi received aPositiveReception from Critics, while TheRise of Skywalker received MixedReviews.
FanCriticism has surrounded Aspects of The Force Awakens being too similar to PreviousFilms in TheFranchise, and TheLastJedi for subverting Conventions of TheFranchise without aCompellingReason.
CriticalOpinions of TheRise of SkywalkerSkywalker have been polarizing; while some praised TheRise of SkywalkerCelebration of TheEntireSaga, TheRise of SkywalkerTribute to CarrieFisher, and return of ManyLongtimeCharacters from TheOriginalTrilogy, many were divided on TheFilm'sPerceivedRetconning of TheLastJedi, as well as TheRise of SkywalkerHeavyFanService.
SomeCritics and Fans have alleged that Lucasfilm lacked SufficientPlanning for TheTrilogy'sOverarchingStory, feeling that TheFilms appear inconsistent and contradictory as aResult of TheSupposedlyOpposingVisions of Directors j.j.Abrams and RianJohnson.
Said Criticism has been directed at TheConsensus that Johnson had essentially been given aBlankSlate for TheLastJedi with noClearGuidelines or Direction from Lucasfilm, and in doing so either controversially handled or ignored many of j.j.AbramsDecisions for The Force Awakens.
For TheRise of Skywalker, j.j.Abrams allegedly chose to further deviate from PlotPoints raised in TheLastJedi, while attempting to introduce j.j.Abrams own that were never mentioned or alluded to during ThePreviousTwoFilms.
SomeCritics felt many of TheNarrativeChoices for TheRise of Skywalker had been raised in anEffort to appease DissatisfiedFans.
Others disagreed with TheDecision not to use a"showrunner" to helm TheSequelTrilogy, akin to OtherIndividuals in Projects undertaken by Disney, while Insider acknowledged Lucasfilm'sStrictCreativeControl over TheFranchise, highlighting how aNumber of FilmDirectors had been hired and later forced to leave Others Projects.
SomeReports indicate that, contrary to PopularBelief, SomePlot points across TheTrilogy were planned in Advance.
TheIdea of LukeSkywalker living on anIsland following LukeSkywalker failure to stop TheMurder of LukeSkywalker Jedi students and then training anApprentice Who would help LukeSkywalker overcome LukeSkywalker self-doubt was first pitched by GeorgeLucas in 2013 during CreativeMeetings between LukeSkywalker and Lucasfilm as Part of StoryDiscussions for Episode Vii
(TheseIdeas would later be used in TheLastJedi).
SeveralPlotPoints of TheRise of LukeSkywalker were pitched in anEarly2014StoryMeeting between LucasfilmExecutives (including DaveFiloni, PabloHidalgo, DougChiang, JohnKnoll, and KiriHart) after ThePlot of The Force Awakens had been finalized, including TheNotion of Leia as aMentorFigure to Rey, Leia breaking through to LeiaSon BenSolo
(kyloRen), and TheNotion of Rey as “theSkywalker” of TheTrilogy by Metaphor rather than BloodConnection.
TheReturn of EmperorPalpatine in Episodeix was planned as far back as TheEarliestDevelopmentPhase of TheTrilogy.
Similarly, Abrams hinted that EmperorPalpatine being Rey'sGrandfather was anEarlyIdea Palpatine being Rey'sGrandfather and LawrenceKasdan had while working on The Force Awakens, although DaisyRidley later claimed that Ideas for Rey'sLineage changed throughout Filming of TheRise of Skywalker.
From StarWarsFilmmakers ===
GeorgeLucas agreed with Critics Who considered TheForce Awakens too derivative of TheOriginalTrilogy.
In anInterview with CharlieRose, Lucas likened LucasDecision to sell Lucasfilm to Disney to aDivorce, and outlined TheCreativeDifferences between Lucas and TheProducers of The Force Awakens.
Lucas described ThePreviousSixStarWarsFilms as Lucas"children" and defended LucasVision for ThePreviousSixStarWarsFilms, while criticizing The Force Awakens for having a"retroFeel", saying: "i worked very hard to make ThePreviousSixStarWarsFilms completely different, with DifferentPlanets, with DifferentSpaceships ... to make it new."
Lucas also likened Disney to "whiteSlavers", which drew SomeCriticism.
he subsequently apologized for ThisRemark.
In 2016, TheDisney-producedStarWarsAnthologyFilmRogueOne was released, and TheDisney-producedStarWarsAnthologyFilmRogueOne was reported that Lucas liked TheDisney-producedStarWarsAnthologyFilmRogueOne more than The Force Awakens.
In 2017, Lucas described TheSequel TheLastJedi as "beautifully made".
In a2019Memoir, DisneyPresidentBobIger wrote that Lucas felt "betrayed" after learning that Abrams were not using IgerIdeas for TheSequelTrilogy.
In 2016, responding to Complaints that The Force Awakens was too derivative of PreviousFilms, Abrams said, "What was important for Abrams was introducing BrandNewCharacters using Relationships that were embracing TheHistory that we know to tell aStory that is new – to go backwards to go forwards".
Abrams apologized for how Abrams handled Chewbacca and Leia'sMeeting after HanSolo'sDeath, noting that HanSolo'sBestFriend and Widow ignore each other, with Leia instead hugging Rey (Whom Leia is meeting for TheFirstTime).
Johnson'sSequel included Leia hugging Chewbacca at TheEnd of TheLastJedi as aWay to apologize for ThePreviousFilmOversight.
Johnson'sInitialResponse to TheScript of The Force Awakens included TheSuggestion of MinorAdjustments to TheEnding.
According to Abrams, these improved TheMovie and made TheMovie line up more with TheLastJedi.
Abrams intended for Bb-8 to help Rey search for Luke, which Johnson changed to R2-d2 (due to being Luke'sDroid, as well as Bb-8 belonging to Poe and not knowing Luke).
Additionally,  Abrams ending featured Rey finding Luke lifting Rocks with TheForce, which was changed due to Johnson'sPlot of Luke having disconnected  Abrams from TheForce.
Johnson stated Johnson saw TheMortisTrilogy of Episodes of TheCloneWars, due to aRecommendation from TheAnimator of TheSeries DaveFiloni, and that it influenced JohnsonPortrayal of TheForce in JohnsonFilm.
he also stated that he considered including Lando in TheFilm, possibly giving he TheRole of NewCharacterdj, but didn't because it would had meant Lando in TheFilm betraying TheCharacters without Redemption.
In 2019, Abrams said that Abrams liked Snoke'sDeath in TheSequel.
Abrams also said that TheBoldness of TheLastJedi inspired Abrams to be more original on TheRise of Skywalker and that TheLastJedi plot did not derail AbramsPlans for TheFilm, adding that in Response to Criticisms of TheForceAwakens, Johnson advised Abrams "not to just do Something that You've seen before."
Abrams also affirmed  AbramsDedication not to retroactively release AlternateVersions of TheFilms, saying, "i feel like [when] You're done with aThing, ... that's What it is."

BoxOfficePerformance ===
Unlike ThePreviousTrilogies, TheSequelTrilogy experienced DiminishingBoxOfficeReturns with EachSucceedingFilm.

Gameplay ==
Gameplay in LegoStarWars is geared towards FamilyPlay, and does not feature aGame-overScenario.
Given aSpecificSet of Characters in EachScenario, based on aScene from each of TheMovies, uptoTwoPlayers can control to TwoPlayers, using to TwoPlayers DifferentAbilities.
By walking up to AnotherFriendlyCharacter, ThePlayer can switch Control over to AnotherFriendlyCharacter; ThisInteraction is necessary in Order to use AnotherCharacter'sAbilities to complete CertainPuzzles.
LegoStuds, SmallCoin-likeCollectibles which serve as TheGame'sCurrency, can be collected by finding  LegoStuds, SmallCoin-likeCollectibles which serve as TheGame'sCurrency, smashing or using TheForce on CertainObjects, or defeating Enemies.
Studs increase in Value based on Color
, Silver is the least valuable at Only10Points, going up to Gold, valued at 100Points, blue at 1000, and the rarest, purple worth 10,000.
Players also have aHealthMeter consisting of FourHearts that gets depleted if  Players get injured or shot at.
When  Players lose AllPlayersHearts,  PlayersCharacter is broken apart and  Players lose Studs ( as opposed to Lives).
TheseStuds can be spent on unlocking NewCharacters for FreePlayMode, Hints for playing TheGame, and Cheats.
CertainSegments of TheGameFeaturePlayers controlling Spaceships flying on aFlatPlane.
There are also SeveralMinikitCanisters hidden throughout EachLevel that, when collected, combine to form aVehicle.
When ThePlayer first starts TheGame, ThePlayer must first complete Chapter I of ThePhantomMenace
("negotiations").
However, once ThatChapter is completed, ThePlayer may choose to play AnyUnlockedLevels from TheOtherTwoMovies in TheOtherTwoMovies DesiredOrder.
Completing AllTheGame'sLevels with FullStudBars will unlock anAdditionalChapter based on TheOpeningScene of aNewHope, which features a'prototype'DarthVader, Who uses Anakin'sFightingStyle, and aStormtrooper Whose movements are identical to TheCloneTroopers (both of these are remodeled in TheNextGame).
TheBackgroundMusic is TheSameMusic used in TheStarWarsMovies, but as TheGame was released before EpisodeIii'sSoundtrack, Music from TheOriginalTrilogy (1977, 1980 and 1983) was used for ThatMovie'sLevels.
For instance, TheAlternateSoundtrack for The"binarySunset" was used in TheSecondChapter of Episodeiii, while "TheBattle of Endor i" was used in Chapter Vi, "PrincessLeia'sTheme" for Chapterv and
"TheBattle of Yavin" was used in Chapters 1 and 3.
In TheCompleteSaga, TheTracks that played during Gameplay of ThatEpisode were replaced with Ones from EpisodeIii, although TheOriginalTrilogyMusic remained in ThatEpisode's cutscenes.
Characters ===
LegoStarWars contains aTotal of 59PlayableCharacters for LegoStarWars; 56 in TheGamecube, Ps2, Xbox, and pcVersions.
The three missing are Gungan, TuskenRaider, and Stap, playable in TheGbaVersion, though TheGungan and Stap are only available through CheatCodes.
ThePlayableCharacters are modeled like ActualLegoParts and, on dying,  ThePlayableCharacters fall to Pieces and also lose Studs.
There is aWideVariety of Characters included in TheGame, all of which are unlocked by completing Levels or by purchasing all of which at Dexter'sDiner.
Characters are divided into Groups according to CertainSkills.
For Instance, Jedi and Sith can double-jump, use Lightsabers, and have Control of TheForce, which They can use to activate or lift LegoObjects or defeat CertainEnemies.
DarthMaul has aDouble-endedLightsaber which improves DarthMaul defence from LaserFire.
JarJarBinks, GeneralGrievous and HisBodyguard have TheSuper-jump, which allows JarJarBinks, GeneralGrievous and HisBodyguard to reach Obstacles that TheJedi and Sith can not jump to.
Characters like PadméAmidala and CloneTroopers, Who carry Blasters, have TheAbility to grapple to reach HigherPlaces.
Droids, while unarmed, can travel through TheGame without being intentionally attacked by EnemyCharacters.
ProtocolDroids and AstromechDroids can open SpecialDoors.
Characters such as BobaFett and YoungAnakin can fit into TightPlaces.
EveryCharacter, other than ThepkDroid, GonkDroid (WhoseOnlyAbility is that They are never killed by Enemies), and ChancellorPalpatine, has aSpecialAbility.
UnlockedCharacters can be imported into TheGame'sSequel, LegoStarWarsii:
TheOriginalTrilogy, as an extra called "use OldSave", which costs 250,000LegoStuds, and can be used in 250,000LegoStuds character creator function.
Because TheGame is based on ThePrequelTrilogy (1999, 2002, 2005), LukeSkywalker, HanSolo, LandoCalrissian and OtherCharacters from TheOriginalStarWarsTrilogy (1977, 1980 and 1983) are not shown, and appear in TheSequelLegoStarWarsii:
TheOriginalTrilogy.
However, if ThePlayer unlocks TheLastLevel (anEpisode4Preview), DarthVader, aStormtrooper, aRebelTrooper and PrincessLeia become available.
OriginalTrilogy characters Chewbacca, Obi-wanKenobi, Yoda, C-3po, and
R2-d2 are unlockable in TheGame since R2-d2 appear in ThePrequel Trilogy also.
FreePlay ===
Once aNon-vehicleLevel has been cleared in StoryMode, ThePlayer may play through aNon-vehicleLevel again in FreePlayMode.
In ThisMode, Players can choose to play through TheLevel with Players choice of UnlockedCharacters randomly selected by TheProgram based on Players abilities.
At AnyPoint, ThePlayer can rotate instantly between each of TheChosenCharacters to access Areas not accessible during TheStoryMode and obtain HiddenExtras.
No Story cut scenes appear in TheStoryMode.
Dexter'sDiner ===
Dexter's Diner === is TheArea where ThePlayer chooses WhatLevel to enter, or They can enter TheParkingLot to view AnyVehicles WhoseParts They have found and pieced together.
TheParts to TheseVehicles are contained in 10Mini-kitCanisters which are hidden throughout EachLevel.
Battles often take Place in TheParkingLot between Canon-goodAndCanon-evilCharacters, such as Jedi and Sith, respectively.
At TheDinerCounter, ThePlayer may purchase, or enter Codes, to unlock Extras in Exchange for LegoStuds They have collected by playing through TheLevels.
GameBoyAdvanceVersion ===
TheGameBoyAdvanceVersion behaves differently than TheConsoleVersions.
it is played from anIsometricPerspective with OnlyOnePlayer, Who controls one of 15PlayableCharacters through StoryScenarios across ThePrequelTrilogy, battling Enemies, completing Objectives and getting from OnePlace to another.
TheLevels are not evenly divided across TheThreeEpisodes, with Episodeii having TheFewestLevels.
EachLevel is divided into MultipleSections that serve as Checkpoints should ThePlayer'sCharacter fall apart, and Players are given aLongerHealthMeter that Players must prevent from depleting to continue.
EachCharacter possesses aSpecialAbility that is constrained by aStaminaMeter not found in TheConsoleVersion.
Players can also find Jawas in CertainLevels Who can award ThePlayerHealth or StaminaUpgrades, as well as aMaintenanceDroid that can save Players once from Death once at ThePrice of CurrentlyCollectedStuds in aLevel.
AllBossBattles are primarily against Villains with Lightsabers, and call for HeavyButton mashing to win, especially when Players can exclusively get caught in LightsaberBladeLocks that must be won to inflict ExtraDamage.
OtherCharacters have DifferentAttackAbilities that are not in TheConsoleVersions, such as Blaster-wieldingCharacters able to fire ChargedShots and AstromechDroids being able to drop ProtonMines that would damage Enemies on Contact.
Players are also encouraged to use OtherCharacters'Abilities in Free-play to discover SecretAreas and find DeathStarPlans, which replace Minikits in TheConsoleVersion.
At TheEnd of EachLevel, Players are rewarded and ranked for how many enemies Players defeated,
HowManyBlasterBolts
HowManyBlasterBolts deflected, HowManyStuds  HowManyBlasterBolts collected and how many Death Star plans
HowManyBlasterBolts found.
ThePlot of TheGame is aHumorousRetelling of StarWars:
i – ThePhantomMenace, StarWars:
Episodeii – Attack of TheClones, and StarWars:
EpisodeIii – Revenge of TheSith, as well as aBonusLevel with TheOpening of StarWars:
NewHope from TheViewpoint of DarthVader aboard TheTantiveiv.

Battlefront is aSeries of First-AndThird-personShooterVideoGames based on TheStarWarsFilms.
Players take TheRole of Soldiers in either of TwoOpposingArmies in DifferentTimePeriods of TheStarWarsUniverse.
aSeries of First-AndThird-personShooterVideoGames based on TheStarWarsFilms was launched in 2004 by Lucasarts with StarWars: Battlefront, developed by PandemicStudios for Lucasarts.
TheGame received PositiveReviews and sold well.
In 2005Pandemic developed aSequel, Star Wars: Battlefrontii, which was also critically and commercially successful.
TheGames were followed by StarWarsBattlefront: RenegadeSquadron (2007) and StarWarsBattlefront: EliteSquadron (2009) for HandheldConsoles and StarWarsBattlefront: MobileSquadrons for MobileDevices.
Lucasarts made SeveralAttempts to develop aThirdMajorBattlefrontGame but noProjects were released before TheWaltDisneyCompany'sAcquisition of  Lucasarts.
Subsequently, eaDice acquired aLicense to develop aNewGame, titled Star Wars Battlefront which was released on November 17, 2015.
aSequel, StarWarsBattlefrontii, was released on November 17, 2017, and was developed by eaDice, CriterionGames, and MotiveStudios.
Gameplay == Games in TheBattlefrontSeries normally revolve around TwoArmies – TheGalacticRepublic versus TheConfederacy of IndependentSystems or TheGalacticEmpire versus TheRebelAlliance or FirstOrder versus TheResistance – fighting each other on VariousMaps.
Maps take Place in TheStarWarsGalaxy, with Battlezones varying in Theme and Size.
Across TheBattlefield are Multiple"commandPosts" (Objectives) that act as spawn Points, and can be controlled by EitherThePlayer or TheComputer.
Units can spawn from AnyFriendlyCommandPost, and Vehicles regularly spawn at UnitsRespectiveCommandPosts when destroyed.
Units can capture NeutralorHostileCommandPosts by approaching  Units and standing within TheImmediateVicinity for About30Seconds.
TheTime to capture quickens with MoreFriendlyUnits within TheCaptureZone.
SomeVehicles act as MobileCommandPosts, and must be destroyed as SomeVehicles can not be captured.
On SomeMaps (such as Hoth or Endor), CertainStructures also act as CommandPosts that can not be captured.
CommandPost capturing Works differently on CertainCampaignMissions as well.
PlayableHeroes and Villains play aSignificantRole in changing TheCourse of Battles.
TheObjective of MostMatches is to eliminate all of TheOpponents'ReinforcementTickets or to capture TheCommandPoints, to slowly chip away at TheOpponents'Tickets.
ReinforcementTickets are used whenever aUnit is killed, or when OneFaction controls aMajority of TheCommandPosts on TheMap (usually when OneFaction only has 2-3).
OnlyOneObjective needs to be completed.
When AllCommandPosts are captured, TheTeam with noCommandPosts has TwentySeconds to recapture or neutralize anEnemyCommandPost.
If TheTeam with noCommandPosts cannot take over aPost in ThisTime, TheMatch is over.
CertainCampaignLevels and Multiplayer have Requirements that differ from TheGeneralGamePlay, however TheGeneralStructure remains the same.
TheGame's"conquest"Mode is vaguely based on TheBattlefieldGameMode of TheSameName.
PlayableCharacters ===
NumerousCharacters from TheMovies, tvSeries and OtherGames have been available to play as, which include: ==
Development ==
TheFirstConsoleGames of TheSeries were developed by PandemicStudios, and since 2015, aSecondSeries of ConsoleBattlefrontGames has been developed by eaDice.

CanceledSequels ===
StarWars: Battlefront III ====
On September 29, 2006, ComputerAndVideoGames made anUnconfirmedClaim that FreeRadicalDesign was developing TheThirdGame in TheStarWars: BattlefrontSeries, titled StarWars: BattlefrontIii.
In June 2008, Kotaku allegedly received Information from aFormerLucasartsEmployee that Star Wars:
BattlefrontIii was in TheCreationProcess.
On October 2,  ActivisionBlizzard filed aClassification with TheAustralianOffice of FilmAndLiteratureClassification listing StarWars: BattlefrontIii for TheNintendods with apgRating (E10+ Equivalent) for MildAnimatedViolence.
However, that same month, FreeRadicalDesign announced that FreeRadicalDesign lost TheRights to develop StarWars: BattlefrontIii; TheGame at ThatPoint had been in Development for TwoYears.
Several years later, FreeRadicalDesignCo-founderSteveEllis said BattlefrontIii was "pretty much done" in 2008, but that BattlefrontIii was effectively canned when Lucasarts could not commit to "spend big" on Marketing BattlefrontIii.
However, Gamespot quoted anUnnamedLucasartsEmployee involved with TheProject Who said FreeRadical could not devote SufficientResources to TheGame and regularly missed Deadlines.
aFormerFreeRadicalDesignEmployee said some of TheTechnology FreeRadical developed for TheGame, SpecificallyTheContiguousGameEnvironment from PlanetSurface into Space, "is dying with us".
During and after TheGame'sDevelopment, Screenshots, and GameplayFootage became accessible to ThePublic.
In December 2008, StarWarsCharacter renders bearing aBattlefrontIiiWatermark surfaced from aLaid-offFreeRadicalEmployee.
The following month, GameplayFootage was leaked from a November 2008 FreeRadical in-House showing of BattlefrontIiiFootage.
GameplayFootage was pulled from Ign after Lucasarts demanded Lucasarts removal.
On April 1, 2012, aUser on TheGameJournalistWebsite Betagames discovered StarWarsModels and Textures buried in ResidentEvil:
OperationRaccoonCity'sArchives; pcGamer'sTomSenior speculated that these could have been from BattlefrontIii.
Also in April 2012, Past to Present revealed Pre-alphaFootage of FreeRadicalDesign'sBattlefrontIii.
YoutubeVideos showing TheGame'sRoughState received MediaAttention from Outlets such as Joystiq, Kotaku, and Shacknews.
On January 20, 2016, aLeakedBuild of TheGame surfaced on Reddit.
aLeakedBuild of TheGame is currently playable using anXbox360DevelopmentKits and modified Xbox360Consoles via aProgram called "RGLoader".
BattlefrontOnline ====
BattlefrontOnline was rumored to be TheNextInstallment in TheSeries.
On January 28, 2010, Kotaku reported that SocomDeveloperSlantSixGames was working with Lucasarts to develop anOnline-onlyBattlefrontTitle due in 2011.
TheGame was said to be released for the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3.
TheGame was also stated that  TheGame may have been TheSource of TheStarWars: Battlefront 3 concept art renders.
However,  TheGame has been canceled after TheStudio was unable to meet  TheGame 2010 release deadline.
FirstAssault and Version Two ====
FirstAssault was to be aDownloadableMultiplayerShooter for XboxLiveArcade.
DigitalTrends speculated that StarWars: FirstAssault might help Lucasarts recover some of Lucasarts previous investment in BattlefrontIii and OtherProjects in TheFranchise.
Speaking to Kotaku anAnonymousInsider noted that TheGame was to be "step zero" towards aThirdBattlefrontGame.
When Footage of TheGame was leaked onto YoutubeTechSite Technobuffalo noted that TheGameplay very closely resembled that of TheCall of DutyFranchise.
Alongside FirstAssault, Lucasarts was also working on aSeparateGame titled "Version 2", which was, reportedly, aCodeName for BattlefrontIii.
StarWarsBattlefrontiv ====
In 2018, ConceptArt surfaced of aCanceledBattlefrontiv, rather than attempting to fit within ThePreviousGamesAndFilms'Continuity, ConceptArt showed TheGame was meant to focus on anAlternateReality where Obi-wanKenobi and LukeSkywalker fell to TheDarkSide, instead of AnakinSkywalker.

CulturalImpact ==
Fan-made SequelGames === ====
Galaxy in Turmoil ====
On January 25, 2016, FrontwireStudios began anAttempt to produce anUnofficialBattlefrontInstallment called Galaxy in Turmoil.
TheFan made Game was in Production using UnrealEngine 4 and was based on TheCanceledStarWars: BattlefrontIii by FreeRadicalDesign.
Although EarlyVersions of TheGame contained Assets from  FreeRadicalDesign, Assets soon became "placeHolders" as TheFullGame planned to be released using Assets and Music made from TheGround up.
On June 4, 2016, Galaxy in Turmoil gained aDistributionDeal through Valve and was planned to be released for free on Steam which generated aFairAmount of Attention.
On June 22, 2016, Lucasfilm requested TheProduction of Galaxy in Turmoil in Turmoil be halted.
On July 31, 2016, FrontwireStudios announced TheCancellation of TheGame was due to The"possibility of Galaxy in Turmoil taking away Attention from ElectronicArts'sBattlefrontFranchise".
Proposals of Galaxy in Turmoil falling under ThePaywall of ElectronicArts, and Ideas of Lucasfilm giving FrontwireStudios aStarWarsLicense were both rejected due to anAgreement between ElectronicArts and Lucasfilm.
Although FrontwireStudios may have fallen within FairUseLaws, LegalConflict was avoided and TheProject was canceled.
There is aPlayableAlpha that contains Assets from FreeRadicalDesign that was released to ThePublic then removed early within Galaxy in Turmoil'sLifetime.
Galaxy in Turmoil is now planned to be redeveloped as aBrandNewCyberpunk-themedip without AnyStarWarsReferences, but still with BattlefrontIii-inspiredMechanics including space-to-Ground battles.

TheBadBatch at ImdbStarWars:
TheBadBatch on Wookieepedia, aStarWarsWiki
OverOneHundredVideoGames based on TheStarWarsFranchise have been released, dating back to some of TheEarliestHomeConsoles.
Some are based directly on Films while Others rely heavily on TheStarWarsExpandedUniverse.
StarWarsGames have gone through ThreeSignificantDevelopmentEras:
EarlyLicensedGames (1979-1993), Games developed after TheCreation of Lucasarts (1993-2013), and Games created after TheClosure of Lucasarts (2014–present), which are currently licensed to ElectronicArts, and include aneaStarWarsLogo.
TheFirstStarWarsGames were developed by aVariety of Companies after StarWarsCreatorGeorgeLucas licensed TheRights to StarWarsVideoGames; several of  EarlyLicensedGames (1979-1993), Games developed after TheCreation of Lucasarts (1993-2013), and Games created after TheClosure of Lucasarts (2014–present), which are currently licensed to ElectronicArts, and include aneaStarWarsLogo were released under The“lucasfilmGames”Banner.
EarlyLicensedGames, released during The8-bitAnd16-bitEras of Gaming, barely featured AnyKind of Narrative, and many were ActionTitles that either retold TheStories of TheOriginalTrilogy (1977-1983) or focused on aSingleScene of aFilm.
Later on, Lucas took Interest in TheIncreasingSuccess of TheVideoGameMarket, and decided to create LucasOwnVideoGameDevelopmentCompany, Lucasarts, so Lucas could have MoreCreativeControl over TheGames and HisOwnVideoGameDevelopmentCompany, Lucasarts narratives.
During ThisEra, Graphics evolved enough for Games to be able to tell ComplexNarratives, leading to Games that featured MoreAdvancedRetellings of TheStories of TheFilms, with Voice-overs and CgiCutScenes, as well as OriginalTitles with NewNarratives that were set in TheSameContinuity as TheFilms.
After TheWaltDisneyCompany'sPurchase of Lucasfilm in 2012 and TheClosure of Lucasarts the following year, TheGames developed during TheFirstTwoEras were discarded from TheCanon in 2014 and reassigned to TheNon-canonicalStarWarsLegendsLabel.
Following Lucasarts'Closure, TheRights to produce StarWarsVideoGames were reassigned solely to ElectronicArts.
Games published during ThisEra are considered canonical to TheFranchise, and have featured MoreInfluence from TheLucasfilmStoryGroup, responsible for managing Aspects of StarWarsCanon.
TheeaStarWarsLicense had been set to expire in 2023, but in 2021, Lucasarts' announced NewPartnerships for Others to produce StarWars and OtherLucasfilmGames alongside ElectronicArts.
Although ManyHobbyists and IndependentGameDevelopers have created FreewareGames based on TheStarWarsMovieSeries and Brand, ThisPage lists OnlyTheGames that have been developed or published by Lucasarts, or officially licensed by Lucasfilm.
As of 2020, there have been Over90MillionCopies of StarWarsGames sold.
EarlyLicensedGames (1979-1993) ==
In 1978, AppleComputer produced anUnlicensedStarWarsGame on CassetteTape for AppleComputer Apple II.
As a"spacePilotTrainee", ThePlayer destroys TieFighters using aFirst-personHeads-upDisplay.
TheFirstVideoGameCartridge bearing TheName StarWars appeared that year on TheRcaStudioiiClonesSheenM1200 and MustangTelespielComputer.
TheFirstOfficialLicensedStarWarsElectronicGame was Kenner's1979Table-topStarWarsElectronicBattleCommand.
TheFirstOfficialLicensedStarWarsElectronicGame had ThreeLevels of Play (basic, intermediate, and advanced).
Players took Turns examining StarSystems with TheAim of avoiding BlackHoles, locating Enemies, and searching for Magna, "TheForce-givingStar".
TheGame was billed as "TheMostExcitingComputerGame You will ever play".
TheOriginalTrilogy ===
LicensedReleases for the Atari 2600  began with The Empire Strikes Back (1982) in which ThePlayer piloted aSnowspeeder during TheBattle of Hoth, destroying at-at walkers.
SeveralOtherGames appeared, such as Return of TheJedi: DeathStarBattle (1983), where ThePlayer controlled TheMillenniumFalcon in aMission to destroy TheSecondDeathStar, and JediArena (1983), TheFirstGame to attempt to simulate aLightsaberBattle (in ThisCase, clearly inspired by TheStarWarsScene, where LukeSkywalker trains with aSeeker).
In 1983, TheStarWarsArcadeGame was released by Atari based on The1977Film.
In ThisGame (featuring ColorVectorGraphics and TheFirstEverDigitizedSpeech from aFilm)
ThePlayer enters TheSeat of Luke'sRedFiveX-wingFighter, BattlesWaves of TieFighters led by DarthVader, weaves through Towers across TheSurface of TheDeathStar, and plummets through TheBattleStation'sTrench in anAttempt to destroy TheBattleStation'sTrench.
TheSequel for TheGame, TheEmpire Strikes Back, used TheSameTechnology to re-create Scenes from TheSecondFilm, including Battles with at-at walkers and anAsteroidField.
Due to TheVideoGameCrash of 1983, which temporarily killed TheHomeConsoleMarket, noFurtherGames based on TheFranchise were released until 1987 when ukSoftwarePublisherDomark released Several8-bitVersions of TheStarWarsVectorArcadeGame, followed by SimilarConversions in 1988 of TheEmpireStrikesBackMachine.
In 1987, Namco developed aStarWarsGame for TheNintendoFamilyComputer (Famicom) for TheHomeConsoleMarket exclusively, based on The1977Film, but with SeveralLiberties taken with TheHomeConsoleMarket storyline.
In 1991, ThePlatformerStarWars was released for TheNintendoEntertainmentSystem (TheFamicom'sWesternCounterpart), SegaMasterSystem, GameBoy and GameGear, and OneYearLater,StarWars:
TheEmpire Strikes Back covered ThePlotline of TheFifthEpisode of TheSaga.
Also in 1992, SuperStarWars was released for TheSnes, followed by TheRemainingGames in TheTrilogy:

So through Lucasfilm, Lucas started LucasOwnVideoGameCompany, which Lucas named LucasArts.
However, since Lucas had already licensed TheRights to develop StarWarsGames, Lucasfilm instead developed OriginalAdventureGames and WorldWariiFlightCombatGames.
Lucasarts regained TheRights to develop StarWarsGames in 1993, at ThatPoint Lucasarts put Lucasarts PreviousExperience in FlightSimulators to use, and released aStarWars: X-wing, TheFirstSelf-publishedStarWarsVideoGame and TheFirstSpaceFlightSimulation based on TheFranchise.

Others, including Battle for Naboo and JediPowerBattles, were released, but with LittleSuccess.
TheFirstStrategicGame in TheStarWars expanded Universe was titled Star Wars: Rebellion and broke NewGround in ThatStarWars:
Rebellion incorporated Ships and Planets not found in TheOriginalCanon, such as TheRebelAssaultFrigate and TheBulwarkCruiser.
But for AllItsGround-breakingNewLooks, its was not as successful as would have been hoped.
TheSecondStrategicTitle, StarWars:
ForceCommander was also released, but failed to keep up with OtherRtsGames, since  ForceCommander was more focused on battling (with noResourceGathering) and used aPrimitive3dEngine.
About a decade later, ResourceGathering lost Popularity in Favor of Faster-pacedCombat-centricRtsGames.

Fan-madeStarWarsGames ===
StarWarsMush was anUnlicensedText-basedRole-playingGame active in TheEarly1990s.
Galaxy in Turmoil ===
On January 25, 2016, FrontwireStudios began anAttempt to produce anUnofficialBattlefrontInstallment called Galaxy in Turmoil.
TheFan made Game was in Production using UnrealEngine 4 and was based on TheCancelledStarWars: BattlefrontIii by FreeRadicalDesign.
Although EarlyVersions of TheGame contained Assets from FreeRadicalDesign, Assets soon became "placeHolders" as TheFullGame planned to be released using Assets and Music made from TheGround up.
On June 4, 2016, Galaxy in Turmoil gained aDistributionDeal through Valve and was planned to be released for free on Steam which generated aFairAmount of Attention.
On June 22, 2016 Lucasfilm requested TheProduction of Galaxy in Turmoil be halted.
On July 31, 2016, FrontwireStudios announced TheCancellation of TheGame was due to The"possibility of Galaxy in Turmoil taking away Attention from ElectronicArts'BattlefrontFranchise".
Proposals of Galaxy in Turmoil falling under ThePaywall of ElectronicArts, and Ideas of Lucasfilm giving FrontwireStudios aStarWarsipLicence were both rejected due to anAgreement between ElectronicArts and Lucasfilm.
Although FrontwireStudios may have fallen within FairUseLaws, LegalConflict was avoided and TheFan made StarWars inspired project was canceled.
There is aPlayableAlpha that contains Assets from FreeRadicalDesign that was released to ThePublic then removed early on within Galaxy in Turmoil'sLifetime.
Galaxy in Turmoil is now planned to be released as aBrandNew"cyber-punk"Themedip without AnyStarWarsReferences, but still with BattlefrontIii-inspiredMechanics including space-to-Ground battles.

SomeThings don't change."

TheLastJedi, Who has gone into Hiding.
Regarding Luke, Han, and Leia, Abrams stated: " TheLastJedi, Who has gone into hiding'd be as old and as mythic as TheTale of KingArthur.
TheLastJedi, Who has gone into Hiding would be Characters Who [the new Characters] may have heard of, but maybe not.

Under aLot of Pressure.
Committed as ever to HerCause, but i would imagine feeling somewhat defeated, tired, and pissed."

Something that was more three-dimensional.
Driver's more dangerous and unpredictable, and morally justified in doing What  Driver thinks is right."
DaisyRidley as Rey: aHighlyForce-sensitiveScavenger Who was abandoned as aChild on TheDesertPlanetJakku and awaits HerAbsentFamily'sReturn.
Ridley said: "Ridley's completely self-sufficient and does Everything for Ridley, until Ridley meets [finn] and anAdventure begins. "

Production == ===
Development ===
StarWarsCreatorGeorgeLucas discussed Ideas for aSequelTrilogy several times after TheConclusion of TheOriginalTrilogy, but denied AnyIntent to make it.
In October 2012,  StarWarsCreatorGeorgeLucas sold  StarWarsCreatorGeorgeLucas production company Lucasfilm to TheWaltDisneyCompany.
Speaking alongside Lucasfilm'sNewPresident, KathleenKennedy,  StarWarsCreatorGeorgeLucas said: "i always said i wasn't going to do any more
and that's true, because i'm not going to do any more, but that doesn't mean i'm unwilling to turn it over to Kathy to do more.
As CreativeConsultant on TheFilm, Lucas attended EarlyStoryMeetings and advised on TheDetails of TheStarWarsUniverse.
Among TheMaterials he turned over to TheProductionTeam were he RoughStoryTreatments for Episodes Vii–ix, which Lucas requested be read only by Kennedy, BobIger, Alanf.Horn, and Kevina.Mayer.
Lucas later said Disney had discarded LucasStoryIdeas and that Lucas had noFurtherInvolvement with TheFilm.
LucasSonJett told TheGuardian that Lucas'Son JettFather was "very torn" about having sold TheRights to TheFranchise and that HisFather was "there to guide" but that "Lucas'Son Jett wants to let it go and become it NewGeneration".
TheForceAwakens'FirstScreenplay was written by MichaelArndt.
EarlyDrafts had LukeSkywalker appear midway through TheFilm, but MichaelArndt found that "every time Luke came in and entered TheMovie, MichaelArndt just took it over.
Suddenly You didn't care about Your main character anymore.
" TheWriters decided to use Luke as TheFilm'sMacguffin and, as Something that TheProtagonists needed to find, would not appear in Person until TheFinalScene.
Arndt also developed SomeBackstoryElements for TheReturningCharacters from TheOriginalTrilogy, such as how Leia was instrumental in rebuilding TheRepublic after TheFall of TheEmpire before being discredited when it was publicly revealed that LeiaBiologicalFather was DarthVader (this would go on to become aCentralPlotPoint in TheCanonicalNovelStarWars:
Bloodline).severalDirectors were considered, including DavidFincher, BradBird, JonFavreau, and GuillermoDelToro; after aSuggestion by StevenSpielberg to Kennedy, j.j.Abrams was named director in January 2013, with LawrenceKasdan and SimonKinberg as ProjectConsultants.
Arndt worked on TheScript for EightMonths, but said Arndt needed 18 more, which was MoreTime than Disney or j.j.Abrams could give Arndt.
TheProduction announced Arndt'sExit from TheProject on October 24, 2013, and LawrenceKasdan and SimonKinberg took over ScriptDuties.
Abrams expressed Relief that TheReleaseDate was announced for December 2015 instead of aPreviouslyDiscussedSummerRelease.
Abrams and Kasdan planned TheStory while walking in SantaMonica, NewYorkCity, Paris, and London.
TheFirstDraft was completed in SixWeeks.
Abrams said TheKey to TheFilm was [returned] to TheRoots of TheFirstStarWarsFilms and be based more on Emotion than Explanation.
In January 2014,  Abrams confirmed that TheScript was complete.
In April 2014, Lucasfilm clarified that Episodes VII–ix would not feature Storylines from TheStarWars expanded Universe, though OtherElements could be included, as with ThetvSeries StarWarsRebels.
Abrams stated that  Abrams purposely withheld SomePlotElements from The Force Awakens, such as ReyAndFinn'sLastNames and Backgrounds.
Kennedy admitted that "we haven't mapped out EverySingleDetail [of TheSequelTrilogy] yet", but said that  Abrams was collaborating with TheLastJediDirectorRianJohnson, and that TheLastJediDirectorRianJohnson would work with TheRise of Skywalker'sThen-directorColinTrevorrow to ensure aSmoothTransition and that "Everybody's got aSay in how we move forward with this".
DaisyRidley later recounted that  Abrams had written Drafts for Episodes 8 and 9.A FictionalLanguage was developed for Use in TheFilm by YoutubeStarSaraForsberg, Who created TheViralVideoSeries "What Languages Sound Like To Foreigners"; Forsberg developed TheLanguage by studying VariousLanguages, such as Hindi and Gujarati.
in November 2015, Lucas recorded anHour-longinterview with CbsNewsReporterCharlieRose in which he said Disney had not been "keen" to involve he and conceded: "if i get in there, i'm just going to cause Trouble because They're not going to do What i want They to do, and i don't have TheControl to do that any more, and all it would do is just muck Everything up.
he also said, "They wanted to do aRetroMovie.
i don't like that.
Every movie, i worked very hard to make Them different
[...] i made Them completely different—different planets, DifferentSpaceships to make it new.
" In EarlyDecember 2015, KathleenKennedy told TheHollywoodReporter that Lucas had seen TheMovie and "liked it".
in TheSameMonth, at TheKennedyCenterHonors, Lucas stated, "i think TheFans are going to love it
, it's very much TheKind of Movie They've been looking for."
Abrams felt that, as the first in aNewTrilogy, TheFilm "needed to take aCouple of Steps backwards into VeryFamiliarTerrain" and use PlotElements from PreviousStarWarsFilms.
=== Pre-production ===
In May 2013, it was confirmed that TheForceAwakens would be filmed in TheUnitedKingdom.
Representatives from Lucasfilm met with Chancellor of TheExchequer George Osborne to agree to produce The Force Awakens in Theuk.

Casting ===
OpenAuditions were held in TheUnitedKingdom and TheUnitedStates in November 2013 for TheRoles of Rachel and Thomas.

ScreenTests with Actors continued until atLeastThreeWeeks before TheOfficialAnnouncement in April 2014, with FinalCastingDecisions made only a few weeks earlier.
Actors testing had StrictNondisclosureAgreements, preventing ScreenTests with Actors, ScreenTests with Actors agents or ScreenTests with Actors publicists from commenting on ScreenTests with Actors involvement.
Though Lucas intimated that PreviousCastMembersCarrieFisher, HarrisonFord, and MarkHamill would return for TheNewFilm as early as March 2013, PreviousCastMembersCarrieFisher, HarrisonFord, and MarkHamill casting was not confirmed until over a year later.
SaoirseRonan, Michaelb.Jordan, LupitaNyong'o and FridaGustavsson, auditioned for NewCharacters; IndustryPublications reported JessePlemons was considered, possibly for LukeSkywalker'sSon;

Talks with AndySerkis and OscarIsaac began by March and continued into April.
That same month, JohnBoyega began Talks after dropping out of aJesseOwensBiopic.
DenisLawson, Who played WedgeAntilles in TheOriginalTrilogy, declined to reprise HisRole, saying it would have "bored" his.
In April, TheCast was announced with aPhoto of TheFirstTable read of TheScript at PinewoodStudios near London, picturing DirectorAbrams with Ford, Ridley, Fisher, Peter Mayhew, producer Bryan Burk, Lucasfilm president and producer Kathleen Kennedy, Domhnall Gleeson, Anthony Daniels, Hamill, Serkis, Isaac, Boyega, Driver, and writer Lawrence Kasdan.
In June, CastAdditions LupitaNyong'o and GwendolineChristie were announced.
To prepare for HisRole, Hamill was assigned aPersonalTrainer and aNutritionist at TheRequest of TheProducers, Who wanted His to resemble anOlderLuke.
Fisher was also assigned aPersonalTrainer and aNutritionist.
Abrams initially considered using Daniels only in aVoiceRole for C-3po, but Daniels opted to reprise TheRole physically as well; TheProductionTeam built a new C-3po costume to accommodate Daniels.
aFlashbackScene was cut from Rey'sVision (following HerDiscovery of Luke'sLightsaber), which would have featured RobertBoulter standing in for Luke as RobertBoulter appeared in RobertBoulter duel with Vader in The Empire Strikes Back.
In May, Abrams announced aDonationContest for Unicef from TheStarWars set in AbuDhabi; TheWinner was allowed to visit TheSet, meet Members of TheCast and appear in TheFilm.

Filming ===
In February 2014, Abrams said Filming would begin in May and last about three months.
TheOfficialAnnouncement came in March, when Disney and Lucasfilm announced that PrincipalPhotography would commence in May and be based at PinewoodStudios in Buckinghamshire, England.
ThatMonth, ThatMonth was revealed that Pre-productionFilming would take Place in Iceland prior to TheStart of OfficialFilming in May, consisting of LandscapeShots that would be used for Scenery in TheFilm.
In April, WaltDisneyStudiosChairmanAlanHorn confirmed that Filming had begun, Filming in Secret in TheUnitedArabEmirates around LiwaOasis, Part of TheEmirate of AbuDhabi, by aSecondUnit.

In July, BadRobot reported via Twitter that 35mmFilm would be at least partially shot on ImaxCameras.
PrincipalPhotography began in AbuDhabi on May 16, 2014.
Abrams and TheCastMembers went to AbuDhabi in Early-may, where LargeSets were built on Location—including aShuttle-likeSpacecraft, aLargeTower, and aBigMarket—and where Explosives were used to create a"blastCrater".
CastMembers were spotted practicing DrivingVehicles that would be used during filming.
Production moved to PinewoodStudios in June.
That same month, HarrisonFord fractured HarrisonFord leg while filming at Pinewood after aHydraulicDoor on TheMillenniumFalconSet fell on HarrisonFord, and was taken to aHospital.
According to Abrams, HarrisonFord'sAnkle "went to a90-degreeAngle".
Production was suspended for TwoWeeks because of Ford'sInjury.
Ford'sSon Ben said TheAnkle would likely need aPlate and Screws and that Filming could be altered slightly, with TheCrew needing to shoot Ford from TheWaist up for aShortTime until Ford'sSon Ben recovered.
A month later, JakeSteinfeld, Ford'sPersonalTrainer, said Ford was recovering rapidly.
Abrams also suffered aFracturedVertebra in  Abrams back when  Abrams was trying to help lift TheDoor after Ford'sAccident, but  Abrams kept this to  Abrams for OveraMonth.

Puzzlewood in TheForest of DeanGloucestershireEngland was used for SomeScenes.
PrincipalPhotography ended on November 3, 2014.
Post-production ===
KathleenKennedy said TheForceAwakens would use RealLocations and Models over Computer-generatedImagery.
RianJohnson, Director of TheLastJedi, reiterated that Abrams would use LittleCgi and MorePractical,TraditionalSpecialEffects, saying: "i think People are coming back around to [practicalEffects].
it feels like there is SortofThatGravity pulling us back toward it.
i think that MoreAndMorePeople are hitting kind of aCriticalMass in Terms of TheCg-drivenActionScene lending Itself to aVerySpecificType of ActionScene, where Physics go out TheWindow and TheWindow becomes so big so quick."
Abrams'Intention in prioritizing PracticalSpecialEffects was to recreate TheVisualRealism and Authenticity of TheOriginalStarWars.
To ThatEnd, TheDroid Bb-8 was aPhysicalProp developed by DisneyResearch, created by SpecialEffectsArtistNealScanlan and operated live on set with TheActors.
In February 2014, IndustrialLight & Magic (Ilm) announced Plans to open aFacility in London, citing Disney'sStarWarsFilms as aCatalyst for TheExpansion.
Ilm'sVancouverBranch also worked on TheSpecialEffects for TheFilm.
Abrams supervised Post-production and Editing of TheFilm at BadRobotProductions'Headquarters in SantaMonica.
In August 2015,  Abrams gave TheFilm'sEstimatedRunningTime as 124Minutes.
Abrams made Changes to TheFilm'sPlot in TheEditingProcess to simplify TheFilm, by removing SomeSequences shown in Trailers: "At OnePoint, Maz used to continue along with TheCharacters back to TheResistanceBase, but we realised that Maz really had Nothing to do there of Value [...]
So we ended up leaving ThoseThings out.

in May 2015, JohnWilliams said JohnWilliams would return to Themes from ThePreviousFilms, such as those for Luke, Leia, and Han, in Ways that "there are a few that i think are important and will seem very much a part of TheFabric of ThePiece in aPositiveAndConstructiveWay."

Reception ==
BoxOffice ===
The Force Awakens grossed $936.7 million in TheUnitedStates and Canada, and $1.132 billion in OtherCountries for aWorldwideTotal of $2.068 billion.
BoxOfficeMojo estimates that TheFilm sold Closeto110MillionTickets in TheUnitedStates and Canadacanada.
The Force Awakens earned 8.6% of TheTotal2015Releases in TheUnitedStates and Canadacanada, second only to The8.8% of TheBoxOffice earned by Titanic in 1997.
it was The24thFilm in CinematicHistory to gross $1 billion worldwide, standing as TheFastestFilm to surpass TheMark at TheTime, doing so in 12Days.
it was also TheThirdFilm in History to surpass $2 billion worldwide, doing so on it 53rd day of Release.
DeadlineHollywood calculated TheNetProfit of TheThirdFilm in History to surpass $2 billion worldwide, doing so on Its53rdDay of Release to be $780.1 million, accounting for ProductionBudgets, P&A, talent participations, and other costs, with BoxOfficeGrosses, and AncillaryRevenues from HomeMedia, placing Hollywood first on TheirList of 2015's"mostValuableBlockbusters".
CommercialAnalysis ====
With aProductionBudget of $259–306 million, plus $175 million for Marketing,PrintingAndAdvertisingCosts, TheForceAwakens was predicted to be aMajorBoxOfficeSuccess.
TheCost of TheFilm was subsidized by £31.6 million (US$47 million) from TheukFilmIncentiveProgram.
TotalCosts, after accounting for ProfitParticipations, Production and Distribution of HomeVideos, as well as OtherAncillaryMediums, is expected to run $423 million.
Reports in April 2015 from TheHollywoodReporter and AmboeeBrandIntelligence predicted TheFilm would earn up to $540 million worldwide for TheFilm opening, breaking TheRecord for TheBiggestWorldwideOpening, as well as breaking TheRecord for TheBiggestU.s.Opening.
They believed that TheForceAwakens would have TheWidestRelease ever, across 4,500Theaters in TheUnitedStates and Canada.
Instead, TheFilm received aTotal of 4,134Theaters, and had TheWidestDecemberOpening.
BoxOfficeAnalystPhilContrino likened TheFilm to Avatar (2009), which opened to $77 million in TheUnitedStates and CanadaCanada and went on to earn $2.8 billion worldwide, saying TheForceAwakens would earn $1 billion "without blinking" and could gross $2 billion.
In August 2015, DeadlineHollywood predicted anOpeningWeekend of $615 million worldwide could be possible, including a$300MillionOpening in TheUnitedStates and Canada.
Months prior to TheFilm'sRelease, BoxOfficeAnalysts reported OpeningWeekendProjections were at $175–250 million.
Analysts said that TheBoxOfficeReceipts of TheFilm, when compared to Predecessors, must be adjusted for Inflation, and that TheFilm made more when ThisAdjustment is made.
it has further been observed that each of TheFirstThreeFilms in TheSeries was more profitable in calculating Revenue against ProductionCosts.
BoxOfficeAnalystPaulDergarabedian said that while Avatar and The Force Awakens were both released on TheSameDate of December 18, HigherTicketPrices in 2015 and ImaxScreenings could push StarWars "into the box office stratosphere".
By January 13, Analysts concluded that it was unlikely that The Force Awakens would surpass Avatar'sGlobalGross.
While The Force Awakens was very successful in TheUnitedStates and Canada, TheSameSuccess was not witnessed in ManyOverseasIndividualMarkets such as Germany, India, LatinAmerica, and Parts of Asia.
One cited Reason for this is that OverseasAudiences do not have TheSameNostalgia or Affinity for TheFilm as those in TheU.s.
TheStarWarsFranchise has traditionally lacked Resonance with Filmgoers in China, and Marketing for TheForce Awakens heavily focused on appealing to ThatMarket.
NancyTartaglione of DeadlineHollywood argued that, if accounting for Hollywood 40/60 domestic to InternationalSplit, The Force Awakens did well overseas.
Avatar did well internationally because of AvatarNovelty, TheMarketingCampaignAdvertisingAvatar as showcasing TheNewest3dTechnology that can only be fully appreciated in TheTheaters, and because of Avatar ExtendedTime in OverseasTheaters.
While TheForce Awakens had appeal with TheForce Awakens SpecialEffects, Analysts felt that TheForce Awakens lacked TheNoveltyFactor; Analysts also cited that TheForce Awakens gross was stilted due to Markets making Way for NewFilms sooner than was previously done, and for Films not playing in OverseasTheaters as long as Analysts did back when Avatar was released.
Dergarabedian stated, "No matter what, [TheForce Awakens] is anAbsolute,All-outBlockbuster without Peer in Terms of TheSheerSpeed at which it has crossed all of TheseMajorBox-officeMilestones."
Moreover, MikeFleming of DeadlineHollywood argued that TheMovie was The"mostValuableMovie" of TheYear, with "TheNetProfit to Disney was anAstounding$780.11m, and TheCash on CashReturn was twice that of AnyOtherFilm [released in 2016], at 2.00".

With TheTrilogy'sSuccess, StarWars became aPopCulturePhenomenon, spawning aMulti-millionDollarMerchandisingEmpire.
Background ==
In 1971, Lucas wanted to film anAdaptation of TheFlashGordonSerial, but could not obtain TheRights.
Lucas began developing LucasOwnStory inspired by TheWork of EdgarRiceBurroughs.
Immediately after directing AmericanGraffiti (1973), Lucas wrote aTwo-pageSynopsis for LucasSpaceOpera, titled Journal of TheWhills.
After UnitedArtists, UniversalStudios and Disney rejected TheFilm, 20thCenturyFox decided to invest in TheFilm.
Lucas felt LucasOriginalStory was too difficult to understand, so on April 17, 1973, Lucas began writing a13-pageScript titled The Star Wars, sharing StrongSimilarities with AkiraKurosawa'sTheHiddenFortress (1958).
By May 1974, he had expanded TheScript into TheFirstDraft of aScreenplay,  but found that TheScript had grown too long for aSingleFilm.
SubsequentDrafts evolved into TheScriptaSingleFilm.
Lucas negotiated to retain TheSequelRights.
TomPollock, then Lucas'sLawyer, writes: "we came to anAgreement that George would retain TheSequelRights.
NotAllThe[merchandisingRights] that came later, mind You; JustTheSequelRights.
And Fox would get aFirstOpportunity and LastRefusal right to make TheMovie.
" Lucas was offered $50,000 to write, another $50,000 to produce, and $50,000 to direct TheFilm; Lucas directing Compensation was later increased to $100,000.
Lucas also negotiated TheSequelRights and Ownership of 40% of TheMerchandisingProfits.
AmericanGraffitiCastMemberHarrisonFord had given up on acting to try to become aCarpenter, until Lucas hired Lucas to play HanSolo.
Casting ==
Thousands of Actors were assessed in TheSearch for TheTrilogy'sMainCast.
Thousands of Actors are considered by ManyViewers to have OnscreenChemistry even though some of  Thousands of Actors were inexperienced, with TheNotableExceptions of AlecGuinness and PeterCushing.
Some, like Ford, have called TheDialogue in TheScripts clunky, and SeveralLines were unscripted; some of these are considered the most memorable moments in TheFilms.
StarWars was released on May 25, 1977; UnlikelyHeroLukeSkywalker is drawn into aGalacticConflict between TheEmpireAndRebelAlliance by TwoDroids and anOldJediKnight; UnlikelyHeroLukeSkywalker helps make one of TheRebellion'sMostSignificantVictories.
TheFilm'sUnanticipatedSuccess led Lucas to make
TheFilm TheBasis of anElaborateSerial.
With TheBackstoryLucas created for TheSequel, Lucas decided that TheSeries would be aTrilogy of Trilogies, with TheOriginalFilm given TheSubtitle Episodeiv – aNewHope to establish TheOriginalFilm as TheFirstPart of TheSecondTrilogy.
TheFirstSequel,StarWars:
Episodev –
TheEmpire Strikes Back, was released on May 21, 1980, and sees Luke begin training as aJedi under TheLastLivingJediMaster, Yoda.
Luke confronts SithLordDarthVader, Who is revealed to be Luke'sFather.
Vader attempts to convert Luke to TheDarkSide of TheForce.
TheThirdFilm, Episodevi – Return of TheJedi, was released on May 25, 1983, and follows Luke as aFull-fledgedJedi.
Luke attempts to redeem Vader, thereby saving TheGalaxy from TheEmpire.
TheSequels were self-financed by Lucasfilm, and generally advertised without TheEpisodicNumberDistinction present in TheSequels Opening crawls.
StarWars ===
aRebelSpaceship is intercepted by TheEmpire above TheDesertPlanet of Tatooine.
Aboard, TheDeadliestImperialWarlord DarthVader and HisStormtroopers capture PrincessLeiaOrgana, aSecretMember of TheRebellion.
Before HerCapture, Leia makes sure TheDroid R2-d2 will escape with StolenImperialBlueprints for anArmoredSpaceStation, TheDeathStar, and aHolographicMessage for TheJediMasterObi-wanKenobi, Who has been living in Exile on Tatooine.
Along with C-3po, R2-d2 falls under TheOwnership of LukeSkywalker, aFarmboy Who has been raised by HisAunt and Uncle.
Luke helps TheDroids locate Obi-wan, NowaSolitaryOldHermit known as BenKenobi.
Luke reveals  Luke as aFriend of Luke'sAbsentFather, AnakinSkywalker, Who was Obi-wan'sJediApprentice until being murdered by Vader.
Luke tells  LukeLuke must also become aJedi.
After discovering HisFamily'sHomestead has been destroyed by TheEmpire, They hire TheSmugglerHanSolo, HisWookieeCo-pilotChewbacca and They space freighter, TheMillenniumFalcon.
They discover that Leia'sHomeworld of Alderaan has been destroyed, and are soon captured by ThePlanet-destroyingDeathStar Itself.
While Obi-wan disables Obi-wan tractor beam, Luke and Han rescue TheCaptivePrincessLeia, passing through IncredibleDangers.
Finally, They deliver TheDeathStar plans to TheRebelAlliance with TheHope of exploiting aWeakness, and launch anAttack on TheDeathStar.
TheFirstRoughDraft, titled The Star Wars, introduced "theForce" and TheYoungHero LukeStarkiller.
[Sic] appeared as Luke'sFather, aWiseJediKnight.
Between Drafts, Lucas read JosephCampbell'sTheHero with aThousandFaces, and was surprised to find that JosephCampbell'sTheHero story "was following ClassicalMotifs. "
TheThirdDraft replaced (a deceased)
Annikin with BenKenobi.
Some months later, Lucas had negotiated aContract that gave LucasRights to TwoSequels.
Lucas hired AlanDeanFoster, Who was ghostwriting TheNovelization of TheFirstFilm, to write AlanDeanFoster, Who was ghostwriting TheNovelization of TheFirstFilm—with TheMainCreativeRestriction that AlanDeanFoster, Who was ghostwriting TheNovelization of TheFirstFilm could be filmed on aLowBudget.
By 1976, aFourthDraft had been prepared for PrincipalPhotography.
TheFirstFilm was titled The Adventures of LukeStarkiller, as taken from TheJournal of TheWhills, Sagai:
TheStarWars.
During Production, Lucas changed Luke'sName to Skywalker and shortened TheTitle to TheStarWars, and FinallyJustStarWars.
At ThatPoint, Lucas was not expecting TheFilm to warrant Full-scaleSequels.
TheFourthDraft of TheScript underwent SubtleChanges to become aSelf-containedStory ending with TheDestruction of TheEmpire in TheDeathStar.
TheIntention was that if TheFilm was successful, Lucas could adapt Foster'sNovels into Low-budgetSequels.
By ThatPoint, Lucas had developed aTentativeBackstory to aid in developing TheSaga.
StarWars exceeded AllExpectations.
TheSuccess of TheFilm and TheFilm merchandise sales led Lucas to make Star Wars TheBasis of anElaborateFilmSerial, and use TheProfits to finance LucasFilmmakingCenter, SkywalkerRanch.
After TheRelease of TheFirstSequel, TheFilm was subtitled Episode IV:
aNewHope in TheScreenplay released in The1979Book TheArt of StarWars and for AllSubsequentRereleases beginning with aTheatricalRerelease in 1981.
TheEmpire Strikes Back
Three years after TheDestruction of TheDeathStar, TheEmpire forces TheRebelAlliance to evacuate TheEmpire secret base on Hoth.
Instructed by Obi-wan'sSpirit, Luke travels to TheSwampWorld of Dagobah to find TheExiledJediMasterYoda.
Luke'sJediTraining is interrupted by Vader, Who lures Luke'sJediTraining into aTrap by capturing Han and Leia at CloudCity, governed by Han'sOldFriend Lando.
During aFierceDuel, Vader reveals aShockingTruth about Luke'sFather.
Owing to FinancialConcerns, AlanDeanFoster'sSequelNovel, Splinter of TheMind'sEye (1978), restricted TheStory to Luke, Leia, and DarthVader.
After TheSuccess of TheOriginalFilm, Lucas knew aSequel would be granted aReasonableBudget, and hired LeighBrackett to write aSequel from Lucas'sStory.
She finished aDraft by early 1978, but died of Cancer before Lucas was able to discuss Changes Lucas wanted She to make.
LucasDisappointment with TheFirstDraft may have made Lucas consider NewDirections.
Lucas penned TheNextDraft, TheFirstScreenplay to feature EpisodicNumbering for aStarWarsStory.
Lucas found ThisDraft enjoyable to write, as opposed to TheYearlongStruggle writing TheFirstFilm, and quickly wrote two more in April 1978.
ThePlotTwist of Vader being Luke'sFather had DrasticEffects on TheSeries.
After writing TheseDrafts,  Lucas fleshed out TheBackstory between Anakin, Obi-wan, and TheEmperor.
With ThisNewBackstory in Place, Lucas decided that TheSeries would be aTrilogy of Trilogies, designating TheFirstSequel
TheEmpire Strikes Back in TheNextDraft.
LawrenceKasdan, Who had just completed writing Raiders of TheLostArk, was hired to write TheNextDrafts, and given AdditionalInput from DirectorIrvinKershner.
Kasdan, Kershner, and ProducerGaryKurtz saw AdditionalInput from DirectorIrvinKershner as aMoreSeriousAndAdultStory, and developed TheSequel from TheLightAdventureRoots of TheFirstFilm.
Return of TheJedi ===
About a year after Han'sCapture, Luke joins Leia and Lando in aRescueAttempt to save Him from TheGangster Jabba TheHutt.
Afterward, Luke returns to Dagobah to complete LukeJediTraining, only to find Yoda on Luke deathbed.
In HisLastWords, Yoda confirms TheTruth about Luke'sFather, and that Luke must confront Vader again in Order to complete VaderTraining.
As TheRebels lead anAttack on TheSecondDeathStar, Luke engages Vader in aLightsaberDuel as the Emperor watches; BothSithLords intend to turn Luke to TheDarkSide and take Luke as BothSithLords apprentice.
Ford had originally not signed on to appear in aSecondSequel, but was convinced to return under TheCondition that FordCharacter would die.
Kurtz wanted aBittersweetAndNuancedEnding outlined with Lucas that not only saw Han dead, but also depicted TheRebelForces in Pieces, Leia struggling as aQueen, and Luke walking off alone (as in aSpaghettiLucas wanted aHappierEnding, partly to encourage ToySales.
This led to Tension between the two, resulting in  Kurtz leaving TheProduction.
TheStarWarsTrilogy, unlike ScienceFiction that features SleekAndFuturisticSettings, portrays TheGalaxy as dirty and grimy in Lucas'sConcept of a"usedUniverse".
This was in Part inspired by ThePeriodFilms of AkiraKurosawa, which like TheOriginalStarWarsTrilogy, often begin in medias res without explaining aCompleteBackstory.
PoliticalScience has been anImportantElement of StarWars since TheFranchise launched in 1977, focusing on aStruggle between Democracy and Dictatorship.
DarthVader'sDesign, initially inspired by SamuraiArmor, also incorporated aGermanMilitaryHelmet.
Lucas originally conceived of TheSith as aGroup that served TheEmperor in TheSameWay that TheSchutzstaffel served AdolfHitler; this was condensed into OneCharacter in TheForm of Vader.
Lucas has also drawn Parallels between Palpatine and HistoricalDictators such as JuliusCaesar, NapoleonBonaparte, and Politicians like RichardNixon.
Stormtroopers borrow TheName of WorldWari"shock"Troopers, ImperialOfficers wear Uniforms resembling those of GermanForces during WorldWarii, and PoliticalAndSecurityOfficers resemble TheBlack-cladss down to TheStylizedSilverDeath'sHead on TheBlack-cladss caps.
WorldWariiTerms were used for Names in TheFilms; E.g.ThePlanets Kessel (aTerm that refers to aGroup of EncircledForces) and Hoth (HermannHoth was aGermanGeneral Who served on TheSnow-ladenEasternFront).
Shots of TheCommanders looking through at-at walker viewscreens in The Empire Strikes Back resemble TankInteriors, and SpaceBattles in TheOriginalFilm were based on WorldWari and WorldWariI dogfights.

Concept and Creation ==
Abrams requested that Ren'sMask be designed to be memorable to aChild.
As late as March 2014, TheFilm'sMainAntagonist was only known to TheProductionTeam as "jediKiller", and had gone through NumerousUnapprovedDesignAttempts.
The same month, GlynDillon'sDesign for TheCharacter'sCostume was finally approved.
According to Abrams, "GlynDillon'sDesign for TheCharacter'sCostume was meant to be aNod to TheVaderMask," and ConceptDesignerDougChiang says that TheCharacter "takes on [the]Persona of [vader] to haunt Luke."
According to The Force Awakens CostumeDesignerMichaelKaplan,
i don't know if it was TheKind of SpaghettiTypeLines on it or What, but TheNextTime J.j. came by that was What we presented to J.j. and J.j.
Also TheSilver in ThoseLines kind of reflects and changes Color with TheAction.
You know, if he's standing in Front of Fire You see that
, so he's standing in Front of Fire almost brings You into TheMask.
Driver'sCasting in TheFilm in anUnnamedRole was first announced on April 29, 2014.
KyloRen was first seen from behind, but still not named, in the 88-second
TheForce Awakens TeaserTrailer released by Lucasfilm on November 28, 2014, wielding aJaggedRedLightsaber with aCrossguard.
TheName KyloRen, as well as TheCharacter'sDesign, was revealed by EntertainmentWeekly in aLucasfilm-designedTopps-styleTradingCardMock-up on December 11, 2014.
aMay2015VanityFairPhotoShoot by AnnieLeibovitz confirmed that Driver would be portraying Kylo.
According to OtherCastMembers, Driver is aMethodActor, which meant that Driver sometimes stayed in Character on Set as Ren and left DriverMask on between Scenes.
Driver explained that DriverGoal was "to forget You're in StarWars and treat HisGoal like AnyOtherJob that's filled with Moments and Problems," because from ThePerspective of TheCharacters living within TheFilm'sUniverse, "DarthVader is real."
Character ==
Abrams told Empire in August 2015, "KyloRen is not aSith.
KyloRen works under SupremeLeaderSnoke, Who is aPowerfulFigure on TheDarkSide of TheForce."
Abrams had previously told EntertainmentWeekly that TheCharacter, "came to TheName KyloRen when TheCharacter joined aGroup called the Knights of Ren."
RobbieCollin of TheTelegraph described Ren as "aHot-headed,RadicalisedDarkSideJihadi, WhoseRedLightsaber splutters and crackles as violently as RenTemper".
Abrams noted, "TheLightsaber is Something that  Abrams built  Abrams, and is as dangerous and as fierce and as ragged as TheCharacter."
TheTelegraph also explains that Ren'sWildAndErraticTemper and "angsty"Instability make Ren dangerous.
MelissaLeon of TheDailyBeast describes Ren'sUse of TheForce as "formidable", citing RenAbility to stop aBlasterShotMid-air, immobilize Victims and probe Victims Minds against Victims will.
Kasdan told EntertainmentWeekly in August 2015, "i've written FourStarWarsMovies now, and there's never been aCharacter quite like TheOne that Adam plays.
i think You're going to see Something that's Brand new to TheSaga," noting that TheCharacter is "full of Emotion".
Abrams explained, "i think that What makes Ren so unique is that Abrams isn't as fully formed as when we meet aCharacter such as DarthVader ...
Abrams is not YourPrototypicalMustache-twirlingBadGuy.
Ren is a little bit more complex than that."
Driver said in December 2015 that, despite TheVisualSimilarities to DarthVader, Ren is "unlike AnyVillain TheFranchise has seen".
Driver explained:
i feel there's aRecklessness about Him that's maybe not normally associated with TheDarkSide.
You normally think of Order, and Structure, and FullCommitment and noHesitation ...
Him's just a little bit more unpolished.
it's in HisCostume, in HisLightsaber—how You kind of get TheSense that it could just not work at AnyMoment; that it could just blow up.
That’s kind of like aBigMetaphor for His.
Driver claimed that Driver was privy to SeveralDetails of KyloRen'sBackstory during TheMaking of TheFilms.
According to LevGrossman, Who interviewed TheActor in TheLead-up to TheRise of Skywalker, Driver reported that “BothHanSolo and Leia were way too self-absorbed and into ThisIdea of HanSolo and Leia as Heroes to really be AttentiveParents in TheWay aYoungAndTenderKyloRen really needed.”
TheBackstory of how BenSolo became KyloRen was elaborated upon in aPrequelGraphicNovel titled TheRise of KyloRen (written by CharlesSoule and illustrated by WillSliney), which was published and released by MarvelComics from December 18, 2019 to March 11, 2020.certainAspects of KyloRen overall arc across TheThreeFilms of TheSequelTrilogy were also known to Driver from TheStart of Production on TheFirstFilm.
KyloRen claimed that KyloRen “had OnePiece of Information of where it was all going...and Things were building towards that.”
he later clarified:
J.j.Abrams told me when i met he for TheFirstTime that i should imagine aJourney of aCharacter completely opposite to DarthVader...
Someone Who starts as aChild and becomes aMan over TheCourse of ThreeMovies.
he becomes closer to he convictions, becomes more assured about he choices, but has metaphorically and physically killed he father to become he own person.
When asked by Ign in December 2017 if he believed KyloRen was capable of Redemption, TheLastJediWriter/directorRianJohnson replied, “Yeah...
Are You kidding?
Vader was worse than Kylo ever was, i think, and  Vader got redeemed.”
Citing TheComplexity of TheCharacter, Johnson articulated, “i don’t see ThePoint of trying to get behind JohnsonMask and learn more about Johnson if all we’re going to learn is ‘Yeah, Johnson’s JustanEvilBadGuy that needs to be killed.’”
TheRise of SkywalkerCo-writerChrisTerrio also supported ThisPosition through comparing Kylo with  Vader.
According to Terrio, “Vader was complicit in Genocide and Cruelty and Depravity.
Yet there is ThisInherentOptimism in StarWars that TheLight in You is never truly gone.
That You can still redeem Yourself right up until TheLastMinute – which, in VaderCase, was literally true...
Leia never really gave up Hope that Kylo could be redeemed, and  Leia knew that Rey was probably TheWay that it would happen.”
Abrams further elaborated on ThisPoint: Maybe it’s TheOptimist in me, but i would like to think that Anyone, EvenSomeone Who does TheMostHorrendousThings, is redeemable.
And certainly because HisMother, Leia, is aBeliever that there is still light in his
, it was hard to imagine that She would be wrong about His.
TheRise of Skywalker revealed that KyloRen and Rey were TwoHalves of a“dyad” in TheForce, which Terrio alternatively described as “sort of Soulmate[s] in TheForce”  and “Twins of Fate, Twins of Destiny.”

TheRise of KyloRen (2019–2020) ===
Ren'sPast as BenSolo is depicted in TheRise of KyloRen.
As aChild, he is trained as aJedi by heUncleLukeSkywalker alongside HisFellowStudents Voe, Hennix, and
he BestFriend Tai
; Voe grows jealous of Ben for heSuperiorForceCapability and Luke'sPerceivedFavoritism and Nepotism.
On aMission to ThePlanetElphrona to investigate anAncientJediOutpost with Luke and LorSanTekka, Ben telepathically communicates with Snoke, Whom Luke had recently fought, for which Ben respects Luke.
Upon arriving on ThePlanet, TheTrio encounters TheKnights of Ren, aGroup of Force-wieldingMercenaries searching TheRuins for Artifacts.
After aBriefConfrontation between TheGroup and Luke, TheirLeader, Ren, stops TheProceedings by activating aKillSwitch on RenLightsaber.
After   and Luke agreeing to aTruce, Ren unmasks and, placing RenMask on TheGround, offers Ben anOpenInvitation to TheGroup'sRanks if Ren ever desires in TheFuture, sensing GreatCapability for "theShadow" within Ren.
Several years later, after CollapsingRenHut on RenUncleLuke after the latter apparently tried to kill Ren in RenSleep, Ben yells towards TheJediTemple in Outrage at Luke'sActions and is terrified when aBolt of LightningStrikes, destroying aBolt of LightningStrikes.
Later that night, Voe, Hennix, Tai return from Off-planet to find Ben before TheJediTempletheJediTemple.
After They are unable to sense Luke'sPresence, Ben elaborates on TheConfrontation, believing Ben to have killed Luke, and States that Ben intends to leave ThePlanet.
Believing Ben to be responsible for TheTemple'sDestruction, Voe attacks Ben only to be easily subdued with Hennix and Tai, and Ben leaves ThePlanet on aNearbyShuttle, with TheTrio in ClosePursuit.
After considering returning to BenMother on HosnianPrime, Ben instead decides to meet Snoke in Person after receiving AnotherMessage from Ben.
Scarred from aPreviousEncounter with Luke, Snoke encourages Ben to seek out TheKnights of Ren.
Traveling to TheOutpost on Elphrona, Ben retrieves Ren'sMask and puts Ren'sMask on, putting ThePair in Communication.
After mentioning Snoke, Ren invites Ben to meet TheKnights of Ren, before Ren is confronted by Voe, having followed Ren via aTracker in RenShip provided by Hennix.
Refusing to fight, only to defend Himself from Voe'sAttacks, Ben uses TheForce to catch Tai after Tai falls off of aBuilding, witnessed by Tai.
However, Hennix, believing Ben to have killed Tai, throws Ben lightsaber in aLethalSpin at Ben; in deflecting it, Hennix is bisected.
Leaving, Ben collapses TheOutpost around Voe and Tai to subdue Voe and Tai and leaves ThePlanet.
Later, Ben meets with RenAndRenKnights, Who informs RenRen will need to provide a"goodDeath" for Membership.
After telling Ren of TheEncounter with Hennix, Ren states that Ben was not responsible for it, and therefore ineligible for Membership, although Ren offers Ren AnotherChance due to Snoke having vouched for Ren.
Providing Ren aUniform, TheGroup proceeds to TheMineMoon of Mimban, where Ben assists TheKnights in stealing anArtifact known as TheMindsplinter from Miners using aVariation of TheJediMindTrick taught to Ren by Snoke.
Ben is horrified when TheKnights subsequently execute TheSmugglers after Ren had promised  Ben to merely release TheSmugglers.
Suddenly, Voe and Tai, having followed  Ben from Tai reading  BenMind, arrive.
Voe attacks TheKnights of Ren, while Tai reasons with  Ben over TaiDecision to leave, and ThePair cease fighting.
Witnessing this, Ren snaps Tai'sNeck, killing Ren, telling Ben that Snoke was wrong and that Ren doesn't wish to "live in TheShadow".
Declaring that "i am TheShadow", anEnragedBen takes up Tai'sLightsaber and anEnragedBen own and duels Ren.
While doing so, Rey senses anEnragedBen from across TheGalaxy without knowing why, Ben'sMother Leia senses Ben'sMother Leia fall, Snoke calls out Ben'sMother Leia praises and Palpatine is revealed to be manipulating BothSnoke and Ben, and to have destroyed TheJediTemple, although Ben remains unaware of this.
TheDuel culminates in Ben impaling Ren, providing Ren The"goodDeath" Ren asked for before sending TheKnights and Voe flying.
Shocked at Ben killing Ren, Voe attempts to reach for RenLightsaber, only for it to be taken by Ben.
Deriding HerRole in Hennix's and Tai'sDeaths and declaring that Her is "not aJedi", Ben knights Voe with Ren'sLightsaber, before turning to find TheKnights of Ren kneeling before TheKnights of Ren, having accepted TheKnights of Ren as TheKnights of RenNewLeader.
Later, on Ren'sShip, Ben crushes TheKyberCrystal from BenOwnLightsaber in BenBareHand and forges Ben aNewCrossguardLightsaber in TheImage of one Ben had seen on Elphrona, taking TheName KyloRen, derived from "skywalker" and "solo".

Reception ==
TheCharacter and Driver'sPortrayal have received CriticalAcclaim; Driver won The2016SaturnAward for BestSupportingActor for BestSupportingActor portrayal.
In January 2018, Kylo was voted seventh greatest movie villain of AllTime by TheReaders of Empire.
ManyReviewers commended Ren'sConflictedNature and Depth, as well as RenCostumeDesign, and noted there were ManyPlaces TheCharacter could be taken in FutureInstallments.
PeterBradshaw of TheGuardian praised TheCharacter and TheActor alike, saying, " PeterBradshaw of TheGuardian is gorgeously cruel, spiteful and capricious – and unlike TheVader of old,  PeterBradshaw of TheGuardian is given to PetulantTemperTantrums, with  PeterBradshaw of TheGuardian lightsaber drawn."
TerriSchwartz of Ign also called Driver'sPerformance "spectacular", noting that "TerriSchwartz of Ign performance adds GreatDepth to aCharacter Who could have come off as one-dimensional, and TheImplications of  PeterBradshaw of TheGuardianArc leave aViewer with Plenty to think about after They leave TheTheater. "
Collin wrote, "To describe KyloRen as ThisFilm'sVader would be accurate in aSense ...
But it would also be to undersell TheDeepIngenuity with which ThisAstonishingCharacter has been crafted by Abrams, Kasdan and Arndt, and also TheWells of EmotionalTumultDriver invests in ThisAstonishingCharacter. "
Comparing TheCharacter to TheOne-noteVader of The1977Film, MelissaLeon calls Ren "a living battleground between Darkness and Light, making Ren a far more resonant and familiar portrayal of ThatStruggle than we've ever seen in StarWars ...
[which] makes Ren a far more interesting villain. "
Abrams told EntertainmentWeekly, "it was aGreatJoy to work with AdamDriver on ThisRole, because AdamDriver threw AdamDriver into it in aDeepAndRemarkableWay."
ToddMccarthy of TheHollywoodReporter noted, "AdamDriver is given aPronouncedInferiorityComplex, aCleverBadGuyTwist that could be taken to InterestingPlaces both in TheWriting and Performance."
PeterTravers of RollingStone wrote, "TheBald-facedAttempt to clone Vader, one of TheGreatestBadasses in FilmHistory, is clankingly obvious, but Driver, masked and unmasked, gives AdamDriverHypnoticAndHauntingContours."
KyleBuchanan of Vulture.com was underwhelmed by TheReveal of Driver under TheMask.
Leon, however, argued: But
ThatFace—that of aNormal,VulnerableYoungMan—is TheMostSubversivelyTerrifyingThing about j.j.Abrams'Reimagining of aNewHope.
Rather than PureEvil, Ren is Something far more familiar: Ren is human.
Just like TheReal-lifeYoungMen with Minds clouded by Fear, Hate, and Anger Who commit UnspeakableActs in OurWorld every day ...
AllTheVisualCues that leave TheCharacter open to Criticisms of not being "evil" enough—are all Signs of Ren'sStruggle between TheDarkSide and TheLight.
SomeViewers noted that Ren's character arc shares similarities with that of TheStarWarsExpandedUniverseCharacterJacenSolo, TheSon of HanSolo and PrincessLeia Who threatens TheGalaxy as aFallenJedi.
Additionally, Critics have noted aResemblance between Ren'sCharacterDesign and that of Revan, TheProtagonist of Knights of TheOldRepublic.

Developers treated TheMainCharacter'sLightsaber like AnotherForcePower, and wanted to ensure "Something visceral and cool" happened with EachButton-push.
TheGame has aComboSystem for stringing LightsaberAttacks and for combining LightsaberAttacks with ForcePowers.
ExperiencePoints earned by killing Enemies and finding Artifacts can be used to increase Starkiller'sPowers and Traits.
TheGameplay is intended to be easy to learn; TheDevelopmentTeam included "horrible"Gamers to help ensure TheGame'sAccessibility.
Players can casually run and Gun through TheGame, but TheGame rewards those Who take aStealthy,MoreTacticalApproach.
TheGame includes Enemies that are easy to overcome; GameDifficulty arises from presenting these Enemies in LargeNumbers that can wear down ThePlayer'sCharacter.
Additionally, Enemies learn from ThePlayer'sCharacter'sAttacks; using TheSameAttack on DifferentCharacters can sometimes lead to ThePlayer'sCharacter doing LessDamage.
TheEnemies, which number over 50, have VariousStrengths and Weaknesses; Developers faced TheDifficulty of effectively placing Developers throughout TheGame'sVariedEnvironments.
VersionDifferences ===
TheForceUnleashed has DifferentFeatures across Platforms.
ThePlaystation 3 and Xbox
360Versions, powered by TheRoninEngine, utilize High-definitionGraphics and AdvancedDynamicDestructionEffects.
360Versions, powered by TheRoninEngine also support DownloadableContent in TheForm of TwoExpansions that expand upon TheGame'sPlot.
360Versions, powered by TheRoninEngine use MotionControls to implement Starkiller'sAttacks, with TheWiiVersion using TheWiiRemote to execute LightsaberAttacks and TheNunchuk to wield ForcePowers, while TheNintendodsVersion utilizes TheTouchscreen to execute Attacks, where SingleActions can be executed by tapping aCertainRegion of TheScreen (with EachRegion corresponding to aParticularAction, such as jumping or Force pushing), while more advanced Attacks can be performed by dragging TheStylus across NeighboringRegions of TheScreen.
ThePlaystation2AndPlaystationPortableVersions are identical in Content to TheWiiVersion, which is different than ThePs3 and Xbox360Version due to TheseThreeSystems lacking
ThePlaystation2AndPlaystationPortableVersionsHorsepower.
Since  ThePlaystation2AndPlaystationPortableVersions do not support or use DownloadableContent,  ThePlaystation2AndPlaystationPortableVersions exclusively intersperse CertainLevels with three of TheFiveJediTrials that Starkiller completes at TheJediTemple in Coruscant to further hone StarkillerAbilities, which are all included in aDlcPack for ThePs3 and Xbox
360Versions.
ThePspVersion also exclusively features FiveAdditional"historical"BonusLevels that re-enact PivotalScenes and Duels throughout TheStarWarsSaga, as well as SpecialScenarios that can be played with as DifferentStarWarsCharacters Who have TheSameAbilities in TheStandardSingle-playerMode.
ThePspVersion utilizes 3-dGraphics like AllOtherMajorVersions, but lacks Voice acting.
TheWiiAndHandheldVersionsSupportMultiplayer.
TwoPlayers duel against each other as FamousJedi and Sith in TheStarWarsSaga in TheWiiVersion, while TheHandheldVersions utilize WirelessMultiplayer for aFour-playerBattleMode.
TheGame begins shortly after Revenge of TheSith, during TheHighestPoint of TheGalacticEmpire'sRule.
After ImperialSpies track down aJediSurvivor of TheGreatPurge named Kento Marek on ThePlanetKashyyyk, DarthVader personally leads TheSearch for DarthVader while overseeing TheImperialInvasion of ThePlanet.
During TheFirstLevel, Players control DarthVader as DarthVader fights DarthVader way through Wookiees to reach Marek, eventually finding and defeating DarthVader.
Before Vader can murder Vader, Galen grabs GalenLightsaber with TheForce.
Realizing TheBoy'sStrongConnection to TheForce, Vader finishes off Marek and takes Galen with Marek, raising Marek to become MarekApprentice, unbeknownst to TheEmperor.
Years later, after Galen (given TheAlias "starkiller" by Vader) reaches Adulthood and completes HisTraining, His is sent by HisMaster to eliminate aSelectGroup of JediSurvivors across TheGalaxy as aFinalTest to prepare His for Vader'sUltimateGoal: assassinating TheEmperor so that Vader and Starkiller could rule TheGalaxy together.
Starkiller travels between Missions aboard  StarkillerPersonalShip, TheRogueShadow, developing aCloseRelationship with  StarkillerCrew: LightsaberTrainingDroidProxy (Who is programmed to regularly attack  Starkiller) and ImperialPilotJunoEclipse.
Starkiller'sTargets include RahmKota, aCloneWarsVeteran and Leader of aSmallMilitia, Who attacks aTieFighterShipyard above NarShaadda to lure out Vader; KazdanParatus, Who became insane after Years of Isolation on RaxusPrime; and Shaakti, Who is hiding out on Felucia.
Before   dies, Shaakti warns Starkiller that he will eventually be betrayed.
Once AllTheJedi have been killed, Vader brings Starkiller before TheEmperor, only to swiftly impale TheEmperor and hurl TheEmperor through aWindow into Space to prove TheEmperor loyalty to TheEmperor master.
Unbeknownst to TheEmperor, Vader has Starkiller rescued and resuscitated, believing VaderApprentice still has Vader uses.
Vader sends Starkiller to foster aRebellion among TheEmpire'sEnemies, as Part of  VaderMaster Plan to destabilize TheEmpire and create TheProperConditions to depose TheEmperor.
Although  Vader orders  Vader to cut  Vader ties to  Vader past, Starkiller rescues Juno, Who was arrested and branded aTraitor to TheEmpire, and escapes with Her and Proxy.
Looking for Allies to aid HisMission, Starkiller approaches Kota on CloudCity, Who survived TheirPreviousEncounter, but was blinded and reduced to Alcoholism, and rescues His from ImperialForces and anEmperor'sShadowGuard.
TheGroup then travels to Kashyyyk to rescue PrincessLeiaOrgana, Who was arrested by TheEmpire, but Starkiller temporarily abandons StarkillerQuest to visit StarkillerOldHome, where Starkiller meets StarkillerFather'sSpirit and discovers Starkiller TrueIdentity  After liberating TheEnslavedWookiees and killing CaptainOzzikSturn, Starkiller earns Leia'sGratitude, Who agrees to join TheRebellion.
Afterward, learning Leia'sAdoptiveFather, SenatorBailOrgana, went missing on Felucia, Starkiller goes to find Starkiller, discovering Organa was captured by ShaakTi'sFormerApprentice MarisBrood, Who, like TheOtherInhabitants, succumbed to TheDarkSide after OrganaMaster'sDeath.
After defeating BroodAndOrganaPetBullRancor, Starkiller spares OrganaLife and convinces Organa to join TheRebellion.
To convince MoreSenators to do the same, Vader suggests that Starkiller attack aStarDestroyerFacility on RaxusPrime to show that TheEmpire is vulnerable.
Juno learns Starkiller is still working for Vader and chastises Vader, but agrees to keep silent.
During VaderMission, Starkiller is attacked by Proxy, Who attempts to fulfill Starkiller programming by killing Vader, but Starkiller defeats Vader, destroys TheFacility, and pulls aStarDestroyer out of TheSky using TheForce .
Following this, Organa meets with FellowSenators Mon Mothma and Garm Bel Iblis on Corellia to formally organize aRebellion, only for Vader to come and arrest FellowSenators and Kota.
After overpowering Starkiller, Vader explains that Vader was merely aTool to lure out and destroy TheEmpire'sEnemies, and that Vader plans to overthrow TheEmperor never included TheEmperor.
Surviving Thanks to Proxy sacrificing TheEmperor to distract Vader, Starkiller vows to rescue TheSenators and Kota, and uses TheForce to ascertain TheSenators and KotaLocation: TheDeathStar.
After sharing aGoodbyeKiss with Juno, Starkiller battles Starkiller way through TheStation to reach TheEmperor'sThroneRoom.
Vader confronts Vader on TheWay there, but Starkiller defeats Vader and faces TheEmperor, Who tries to goad Vader into finishing off VaderFormerMaster so Starkiller can take VaderPlace.
While TheEmperor is distracted, Kota steals TheEmperor's lightsaber and tries to attack TheEmperor from Behind, but is subdued with ForceLightning.
At ThisPoint, ThePlayer must choose between saving Kota (lightSide) or killing Vader (DarkSide).
If ThePlayer chooses TheLightSide, Starkiller defeats TheEmperor, but spares TheEmperor at Kota'sUrging.
TheEmperor unleashes MoreForceLightning, but Starkiller absorbs TheEmperor, sacrificing TheEmperor to allow Kota and TheSenators escape on TheRogueShadow.
Later, TheEmperor and Vader look over Starkiller'sCorpse, concerned that he has become aMartyr to inspire TheNewlyFormedRebelAlliance.
On Kashyyyk, TheEmperor and Vader decide to proceed with TheRebellion and Leia chooses Starkiller'sFamilyCrest as TheEmperor and Vader symbol.
Outside, Juno talks to Kota, Who tells Her that among Starkiller'sDarkThoughts, Juno was OneBrightSpot that he held onto right until he death.
This is TheCanonicalEnding of TheGame, as confirmed by
ThisNovelization.
If ThePlayer chooses TheDarkSide, Starkiller finishes off Vader and is congratulated by TheEmperor, Who commands ThePlayer to kill Kota to sever ThePlayer ties to TheJedi and become aSithLord.
Instead, Starkiller attacks TheEmperor, Who blocks TheAttack and crushes ThePlayer with TheRogueShadow, severely injuring Starkiller and killing Juno, Kota, and TheSenators.
Starkiller later awakens to find  Starkiller broken body being grafted with Armor so that  Starkiller could continue serving TheEmperor, though  Starkiller assures Starkiller that  Starkiller, like Vader, will be replaced once  Starkiller finds aNew,MorePromisingApprentice.
DownloadableContent ===
ThreeDownloadableContent (Dlc)Levels for TheGame were released.
TheFirstOne is set during TheEvents of TheMainStory and explores more of Starkiller'sBackground, while TheSecondAndThirdOnes expand upon TheNon-canonicalDarkSide of TheGame, taking Place in TheSecondAndThirdOnes own AlternateTimeline.

Cast and Characters ==
Sam Witwer as GalenMarek/starkiller — TheForbiddenChild of aJedi, Starkiller was adopted by HisFather'sKiller, DarthVader, Who, aware of HisStrongConnection to TheForce, raised His to be His secret apprentice.
Once   Training is complete, Starkiller is dispatched by   Master to kill SeveralProminentJedi Who survived TheGreatJediPurge.
Although initially acting as aVillain, Starkiller is "ReallyJust[a]DamagedKid."
Developers decided not to give Starkiller aName in TheGame, but TheNovelization reveals TheNovelization real name as "GalenMarek".
Although Starkiller starts as Vader'sApprentice, aFocus of TheGame is to allow TheCharacter to evolve into "Something more heroic, Something greater."
AudioDirectorDavidCollins saw aResemblance between Starkiller concept art and AudioDirectorDavidCollins friend, Witwer; AudioDirectorDavidCollins asked for Witwer'sHeadshot and anAuditionReel, and a few weeks later Witwer sat for a45-minuteAudition.
Witwer secured TheRole by demonstrating to Developers WitwerDeepUnderstanding of TheCharacter; in portraying Starkiller, Witwer brought ManyNewIdeas about TheCharacter and imbued TheCharacter with aSense of Humanity.
Developers tried not to make Starkiller so evil that Players would have Difficulty connecting to Starkiller, aiming to strike aBalance between Loyalty to StarkillerMasterAndStarkillerGrowingSense of Disillusionment with TheEmpire.
TheCharacter'sName is anHomage to "AnakinStarkiller," TheOriginalName of TheCharacter that eventually became LukeSkywalker.
MattSloan as DarthVader — aPowerfulDarkLord of TheSith,High-rankingEnforcer of TheEmpire, and Starkiller'sMaster, Who discovers Starkiller as aChild and trains Starkiller.
In training Starkiller by having Him hunt TheFewRemainingJediSurvivors, Vader intends to prepare Him to overthrow TheEmperor, although there are "twists and turns" in ThisScheme.
TheEvents depicted in The Force Unleashed are pivotal to VaderHistory and Development, depicting Him as being largely responsible for TheEvents leading to TheGalacticCivilWar, depicted in TheOriginalStarWarsTrilogy.
NathalieCox as JunoEclipse — RogueShadow’sPilot and Starkiller'sLoveInterest.
Eclipse was not originally Part of TheGame; EarlyConcepts had TheApprentice as anOlderCharacter Who develops aConnection with aYoungPrincessLeia.
StarWarsCreatorGeorgeLucas, uncomfortable with ThisIdea, encouraged TheDevelopers to create aLoveInterest.
TheApprentice, Who has had LimitedInteraction with Women when TheGame begins, does not at first know how to act around aYoungPrincessLeia.
HerIntroduction early in TheGame allows TheRelationship with Starkiller to develop, and HerInclusion helps "recapture that RichEnsemble feel of TheOriginalStarWars".
According to SeanWilliams, Who wrote TheNovelization, TheRomanticStoryline is TheKey to TheForceUnleashed.
TheName "junoEclipse" was originally proposed as aName for TheCharacter eventually called "Asajj Ventress" — it was ultimately rejected as insufficiently villainous.
TheForceUnleashedProject lead
HadenBlackman brought TheName back for TheMythicQuality of TheName "juno" and TheDuality suggested by an"eclipse."
Cox, in Addition to strongly resembling TheCharacter'sConceptArt, had "Integrity and Poise" appropriate to JunoEclipse that helped TheActor secure TheRole.
CullyFredricksen as GeneralRahmKota —
aJediMasterAndCloneWarsVeteran Who provides Starkiller with AdditionalInsight into TheForce and helps connect Him to Him JediHeritage.
Developers realized early that Starkiller would require Insight into TheForce from Someone other than DarthVader; after rejecting TheIdea of this coming from TheSpirit of Qui-gonJinn or SomeVersion of DarthPlagueis, Developers decided to fill ThisRole with one of Starkiller'sJediOpponents.
TheCharacter was conceived as a "tough-as-Nails" contrast to TheMoreTraditionalImage of aJedi represented by Jinn and Obi-wanKenobi.
SeniorConceptArtistAmyBethChristianson drew upon SamuraiInfluences for Kota'sAppearance.
TheCharacter changed little after being conceived; Fredricksen'sOwnTraits made  TheCharacter tougher.
Fredricksen was TheFirstActor cast for TheProject.
AdrienneWilkinson as MarisBrood —
aZabrakSurvivor of TheJediPurge and ShaakTi'sApprentice.
After HerMaster'sDeath at Starkiller'sHands, Brood falls to TheDarkSide and uses Felucia'sInhabitants to wage War on TheImperialForces trying to occupy ThePlanet.
TheCharacter was originally conceived as aPirateCaptain, and Christianson'sEarlyArt included Brood'sDistinctiveLightsaberTonfas.
Wilkinson brought Strength to WilkinsonPerformance, leading to anExpansion of TheRole with MoreDialogue.
Davidw.Collins as Proxy — Starkiller'sDroidSidekick,
designed to constantly test HisLightsaberAndForceAbilities, as well as deliver ImportantMessages through HolographicProjection.
Davidw.Collins as Proxy — Starkiller'sDroidSidekick said Proxy has C-3po'sInnocence but also is "really dangerous."
TheCompanionTradePaperback describes TheConflict between Proxy'sPrimaryProgramming to kill StarkillerAndStarkillerSelf-imposedDesire to help Starkiller; Proxy is eager to please Starkiller, but does not know how dangerous it can be or that there is aConflict between it Programming and Starkiller's Wishes.
Trying to avoid having Proxy'sDialogue become too reminiscent of EitherC-3po or the villainous HK-47 of Knights of TheOldRepublic, Developers focused on Proxy'sFriendlyNaïvety.
JimmySmits as BailOrgana —
TheEmmyAward-winningSmits voices TheCharacter he played in TheStarWars prequels: aGalacticSenator from Alderaan and PrincessLeia'sAdoptiveFather Who becomes aFoundingMember of TheRebelAlliance.
OtherPerformances include TomKane as KentoMarek and CaptainOzzikSturn, LarryDrake as KazdanParatus, SusanEisenberg as Shaakti, and CatherineTaber as PrincessLeiaOrgana.
In Addition to voicing Starkiller, Witwer also provided TheVoice of EmperorPalpatine.
R2-d2 also makes anAppearance in TheGame alongside Leia.
TheGame'sDownloadableContent features Davidw.Collins as Jabba TheHutt, DeeBradleyBaker as BobaFett, RobRackstraw as Obi-wanKenobi, and LloydFloyd as LukeSkywalker.
Development == ===
Concept ===
GamePlanning began in Summer 2004.
Initially, AboutSixDevelopers started with a"cleanSlate" to conceptualize aNewStarWarsGame; TheSmallGroup of Engineers, Artists, and Designers spent more than a year brainstorming Ideas for What might make aGoodGame.
Over100InitialConcepts were whittled down to 20 to 25 that included making TheGame the third entry in TheKnights of TheOldRepublicSeries or having TheProtagonist be aWookiee"superhero", DarthMaul, aBountyHunter, aSmuggler, aMercenary, or TheLastMember of TheSkywalkerFamily.
TheDecision to focus on TheLargelyUnexploredPeriod between Revenge of TheSith and aNewHope helped energize TheDesignTeam.
ConsumerFeedback helped TheDevelopers narrow in on SevenConcepts, and Elements from those seven went into TheForceUnleashed'sOverallConcept.
Production was greatly aided by ConceptArt, which was intended to visually bridge TheTwoStarWarsTrilogies, convey TheImpression of a "lived-in" Universe, show how TheGalaxy changes under ImperialRule, and to seem familiar yet new.
anOff-handComment about TheForce in TheGame being powerful enough "to pull aStarDestroyer out of TheSky" inspired anImage by SeniorConceptArtistAmyBethChristenson that became anImportantPart of TheDevelopers'IdeaPitches and evolved into aMajorMoment in TheGame.
TheseIllustrations also inspired TheCreation of Dozens of Simple,Three-dimensionalAnimations.
Eventually, aOne-minutePrevisualizationVideo highlighting TheIdea of "kicking Someone'sAss with TheForce" helped convince TheDesigners that TheForceUnleashed would be "aGreatGame";
GeorgeLucas, upon seeing TheOne-minuteVideo, told TheDesigners to "go make ThatGame".
Once TheConcept was solidified, TheDevelopmentTeam grew from TentoTwentyPeople.
TheIdea of "reimagining" TheForce as "amped up" in TheForce Unleashed aligned with Lucasarts'OverallGoal of harnessing ThePower of TheLatestVideoGameConsoles to "dramatically"ChangeGaming, specifically through TheUse of Simulation-basedGameplay.
In April 2005, after SeveralMonths of Planning, Lucasarts received Lucas'Encouragement to create aGame centered on DarthVader'sSecretApprentice in TheLargelyUnexploredPeriod between Revenge of TheSith and aNewHope,  drawing TheTwoTrilogies together.
Lucasarts spent SixMonths developing TheStory.
Lucas spent Hours discussing with TheDevelopers TheRelationship between DarthVader and EmperorPalpatine and provided Feedback on What DarthVader would want out of and how DarthVader would motivate anApprentice.
LucasLicensing reviewed ManyGameDetails to ensure LucasLicensing fit into Canon.
FocusGroupFeedback indicated that, while hunting down Jedi at DarthVader'sOrder would be fun, TheCharacter should be redeemed, in keeping with aMajorStarWarsMotif.
Although TheGame introduces NewCharacters, Developers felt ThePresence of Characters AlreadyPart of StarWars would help anchor TheGame within TheOfficialContinuity.
Before TheGame'sRelease, Lucasfilm claimed Lucasfilm would "unveil NewRevelations about TheStarWarsGalaxy" with a"redemption"Motif.
TheStory progresses through aCombination of ScriptedEvents, in-Game cinematics, Cutscenes, and Dialogue.
Technology ===
During Pre-production, About30People were on TheProjectTeam.
Lucasarts spent SeveralYears developing TheTools and Technology to create The Force Unleashed.
Prototyping, LevelConstruction, Marketing, and PublicRelations took about a year.
Until late 2006, TheProductionTeam was ascertaining "HowManyPolygons, Lights, [and]Characters" Next-generationPlatforms supported; aYear of FullProduction began in early 2007.
aSeries of Quickly-produced"playBlast
" Videos helped TheDevelopers focus on Mechanics, TheUserInterface, and finishing Moves.
Development of TheXbox360Version came first; Playstation3Development started when TheProductionTeam had EnoughDevelopmentKits.
Making TheGame run on both the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 was "aMonumentalTask".
TheGame is based on Lucasarts'Proprietary"ronin"GameEngine but also integrates Third-partyTechnology
:Havok for RigidBodyPhysics, PixeluxEntertainment's"digitalMolecularMatter" (dmm) for DynamicallyDestructibleObjects, and Naturalmotion'sEuphoria for RealisticNon-playerCharacter ArtificialIntelligence.
Lucasarts'Programmers had to overcome TechnicalHurdles to get
Dmm- AndEuphoria-codedComponents to interact.
Developers also had to strike aBalance between RealisticAndEntertainingPhysics.
Lucasarts initially opted not to release aPersonalComputerVersion of TheForceUnleashed, stating that doing TheGame well would be too processor-intensive for TypicalPcs and that scaling down TheGame's procedural physics for ThepcPlatform would "fundamentally" change TheForceUnleashed's gameplay.
However, Lucasarts later announced WindowsAndMacVersions of TheGame, developed in Conjunction with AspyrMedia, for Release in
Fall2009.lackingHavok,Euphoria,AndDmm,Krome'sWiiVersion relies on the company's in-House physics engine.
SomeCharacterAnimations may be Ragdoll while Others are preset; in developing TheGame, Krome tried to blur TheDistinction between the two.
TheLightingSystem in TheWiiVersion is more advanced than that in ThePs2Version, which Krome also built; ThePs2 includes MoreGraphicDetails than TheirPspVersion.
IlmCollaboration and CastPerformance ===
TheForceUnleashed is intended to make Players think Players are "actually, finally, in aStarWarsMovie".
it is TheFirstGame on which Lucasarts and IndustrialLight & Magic (ilm) collaborated since They both relocated to TheLettermanDigitalArtsCenter in SanFrancisco, California.
ThisCollaboration allowed TheCompanies to co-develop Tools to make Film-qualityEffects.
Lucasarts worked with Ilm'sZenoToolFramework and helped Ilm build Lucasarts Zed game editor.
Lucas said having TheTwoCompanies working together in TheSameBuilding was "aGreatCollaboration".
it took SeniorManager of Voice and Audio DarraghO'farrell FourMonths to cast The Force Unleashed.
Ilm'sFace-AndMotion-capture"clonecam"Technology recorded Actors'VoiceAndPhysicalPerformances.
This led to aChange in Lucasarts'CastingProcess: for TheFirstTime, Actors needed to match Characters'Age and Gender.
Actors performed ActorsLines together, rather than in Isolation, to better get TheSense of ActorsCharacters interacting with each other.
Consequently, TheScript'sDialogue was reduced while Reliance on Characters'Expressions — captured through TheClonecam — increased.
ClonecamTechnology had previously been used in producing ThePirates of TheCaribbeanMovies.
LucasartsMusicSupervisorJesseHarlin said  Music === matches TheGame'sMotif of Redemption and Goal of bridging TheGap between Revenge of TheSith and aNewHope:
we had to make sure that TheGame'sScore started off rooted within ThePrequelTrilogy feel of EthnicPercussion and SweepingThemes that spoke to TheNobility and Grandeur of TheOldJediOrder.
As TheGame progresses, however, TheEmpire gains MoreControl, TheJedi are hunted, and TheOrderedControl of ThePrequels gives Way to TheMoreRomanticTemperament of TheOriginalTrilogy.
TheGame'sSoundtrack includes Material composed by JohnWilliams for TheFilms in Addition to Material created specifically for TheForceUnleashed.
JesseHarlin composed TheGame'sMainTheme, while MarkGriskey composed TheScore.
MarkGriskey made Use of SeveralMotifs from TheFilmScores as well as Harlin'sMainTheme.
The90-minuteSoundtrack was recorded by TheSkywalkerSymphonyOrchestra and mixed at SkywalkerSound in LucasValley in September and October 2007.
During Gameplay, aProprietaryEngine combines "musicalElements according to ThePace, Plot, and Environment of TheGame at AnyGivenMoment", resulting in aUniqueMusicalExperience.
aPromotionalSoundtrackAlbum was made available online through Tracksounds.com in 2008.
Expansion ===
Two weeks after TheGame'sRelease, Lucasarts announced Development on TwoDownloadableExpansionPacks for ThePlaystation3AndXbox360Versions of TheGame.
TheFirstExpansion added "skins" that allow ThePlayer'sCharacter to appear as StarWars figures other than Starkiller, such as Obi-wanKenobi, AnakinSkywalker, Qui-gonJinn, JangoFett, C-3po, LukeSkywalker, DarthMaul, DarthSion, MaceWindu, PloKoon, KitFisto and Ki-adi-mundi.
TheSkins chosen to be Part of TheExpansion were based in Part on Fans'Feedback.
TheSecondExpansionPack added aNewMission that expands on Starkiller'sBackground.
Although aMoment in TheGame'sMainStory was considered as a"jumpingOffPoint" for TheExpansion, Lucasarts decided instead to make aNewMission that expands on Starkiller'sBackground instantly accessible to Players.
TheMission'sLocation — TheJediTemple on Coruscant — appears in TheWii, Playstation2AndPlaystationPortableVersions of TheForceUnleashed, but was cut during planning from ThePs3 and Xbox360Platforms.
TheTatooineDownloadableContent, released August 27, 2009, is the first of TwoExpansions that occur in an"infinities"Storyline, anAlternateHistory in which Starkiller kills Vader and becomes Palpatine'sAssassin.
TheSecondInfinitiesExpansion, which takes Place on Hoth, was originally only available as Part of TheUltimateSithEdition, which also includes AllPreviousDownloadableContent.
However, TheHothExpansion was later made available for Download on ThePlaystationNetwork and Xbox Live.

TheForceUnleashed won a Writers Guild of America award for BestVideoGameWriting.
Playstation 3, Xbox 360 and PC ===
The Force Unleashed received mixed to FairlyPositiveReviews.
ElectronicGamingMonthly said TheGame is "ambitious--yet dissatisfying"; however, Gamespot said TheGame "gets more right than TheGame does wrong".
Gamespot said ThepcPort of TheGame retained all of TheGame's strengths and Weaknesses, but that ThepcPort of TheGame failed to take Advantage of ThepcPlatform.
Gamespot called TheGame'sStory "more intimate and more powerful" than TheStarWarsFranchise'sPrequelTrilogy; X-play identified TheGame'sStory as one of TheGame's"fewBrightSpots" and said TheGame'sVisuals successfully convey StarWars'"classicUsedUniverse" feel.
Gamepro and Gamespot praised TheGame'sArt and Physics, and Gamepro also commended Starkiller's"coolPowers".
Ign praised the game's voice acting, ParticularlyWitwer'sPerformance as Starkiller.
TheWashingtonTimes identified MarkGriskey'sSoundtrack as "AnotherStar" of TheGame, and Tracksounds called it "the most entertaining Star Wars score since Return of TheJedi".
Time called The Force Unleashed TheSeventhBestVideoGame of 2008.
TheSeventhBestVideoGame of 2008 received Gamespot's2008Award for BestUse of aCreativeLicense and was nominated for BestVoiceActing.
GamingTarget selected TheSeventhBestVideoGame of 2008 as one of GamingTarget "40Games
we'll Still Be Playing From 2008".
Conversely, EntertainmentWeekly called The Force Unleashed TheSecond-worstGame of 2008 and
Gametrailers called Gametrailers the most disappointing game that year; Gametrailers was also aNominee for Gamespot'sMostDisappointingGameRecognition.
OfficialXboxMagazine cited TheGame'sLinearGameplay and Lack of Multiplayer as reasons TheGame falls short of being "anAll-engrossingStarWarsExperience".
Gamestm suggested that allowing Players to take aHack-and-slashApproach means many "will never view TheTitle'sFullPotential".
Ign and X-play criticized SomeBossBattles and Enemies'Behavior; Gamepro also faulted "disappointing"BossBattles and TheGame's"uneven"Combat.
Rather than feeling more powerful as TheGame progresses, Gamepro felt that Increases in Starkiller'sPowers were dampened by IncreasinglyDifficultEnemyAbilities and Positions; X-play commented that despite aGoodLevel-upSystem, StarkillerAndStarkillerEnemies are "pretty much on EvenGround most of TheTime".
Wired.com, X-play, and Gamespot criticized TheGame'sThird-personCamera and TheSequence that requires ThePlayer to make Starkiller pull aStarDestroyer out of TheSky.
Wired.com speculated that Lucasarts could have recognized TheFrustration of TheStarDestroyerSequence and removed TheStarDestroyerSequence, but left TheStarDestroyerSequence in because They hyped TheStarDestroyerSequence before TheGame'sRelease.
Wired.com and Gamespot further criticized TheLoadTimes and AbruptGameplay-cinematicTransitions.
Gamespot also faulted "loose" targeting and SomeVisualAndAudioGlitches.
Ign, which also identified Problems with Targeting, speculated that Dmm'sProcessorIntensiveness limited Dmm'sProcessorIntensiveness use throughout TheGame, detracting from Players'Ability to feel immersed.
Gametrailers and Ign were disappointed with TheLack of Variety within and between Levels.
X-play, pointing to "DefaultText" as TheBonusObjectiveDescription in TheXbox360Version'sFinalMission and OtherGlitches, said it seems the developers OneDay "just stopped working on TheGame".
Gamespot cited ThePort'sLack of VisualOptions and PoorFramerate as Evidence ThepcEdition had been rushed.
Ign described TheJediAcademyExpansion as "pretty decent".
Gamespot said Lucasarts seems to have acknowledged some of TheGame'sCriticisms in developing TheTatooineExpansion, but  Ign called TheLevel'sBoss fights "aJoke" in Light of ThePlayer'sHighForcePowers.
Ign found TheLevelDesign in TheUltimateSithEdition'sHothScenario uninteresting, and called TheBoss fight against LukeSkywalker tough but "not nearly as fun" as it could have been.
TheDemo was TheFourthMost-playedXboxLiveGame during TheWeek of August 25, trailing GrandTheftAutoiv, Halo 3, and Call of Duty 4: ModernWarfare; it was TheNinthMost-playedXboxLiveTitle throughout all of 2008.
TheWeek TheWeek was released, TheForceUnleashed was TheSixthMost-playedGame on Xbox Live, and TheWeek rose to fifth the following week.
In TheWeek first week on Sale in Australia, ThePs3 and Xbox
360Versions of TheForceUnleashed were TheTopAndSecond-bestSellers, respectively.

OtherPlatforms ===
NintendoPower praised TheStory and TheNumber of LightsaberCombos but criticized TheGame'sEasiness and Hack-and-slashGameplay.
NintendoPower also praised TheWiiVersion for NintendoPower story and ForcePowers, but criticized TheGame'sLightsaberControls and LinearGameplay.
Gamespot noticed VisualGlitches and ProblematicAudioCompression that detracted from TheWiiVersion's"matureAndExciting"Story, adding that TheReducedNumber of Force-manipulableObjects helps mitigate TheTargetingProblems experienced on OtherPlatforms.
Referring to TheWiiRemoteAndNunchuckControls,  Gamespot also speculated that TheForceUnleashed is "PossiblyTheMostWaggle-heavy"WiiGame.
ZeroPunctuation criticized TheWiiVersion'sGraphics and compared LightsaberCombat to "trying to follow anAerobicsRoutine with BothYourArms tied to DifferentWindmills".
TheAbility to upgrade Starkiller'sAbilities in ThePs2Version, according to Ign, is not as "robust" as it should be, and TheGame'sTargetingSystem is sometimes frustrating.

Concept and Creation ==
Frankoz provided Yoda'sVoice in EachFilm and performed as LeadPuppeteer in TheOriginalTrilogy,StarWars:
i – ThePhantomMenace and StarWars: TheLastJedi, as well as appearing for aVocalCameo in StarWars:
TheRise of Skywalker.
For SomeWalkingScenes in The Empire Strikes Back and ThePhantomMenace, DwarfActors DeepRoy and WarwickDavis appeared in Costume as Yoda (though neither was credited).
While Frankoz served as ThePrimaryPerformer, over TheYears Frankoz had been assisted by aMultitude of OtherPuppeteers, including: KathrynMullen (ep.
V), WendyFroud (ep.
V), DavidBarclay (ep.
V-vi), MikeQuinn (ep.
vi), DavidGreenaway (ep.
i & Vi), DonAusten (Ep.
i), KathySmee (ep.

Viii), Damian Farrell

For TheRadioDramatizations of TheEmpire Strikes Back and Return of TheJedi, Yoda was voiced by JohnLithgow while TomKane voiced JohnLithgow in TheCloneWarsAnimatedSeries and SeveralVideoGames.
TheMake-upArtist StuartFreeborn based Yoda'sFace on  TheMake-upArtist StuartFreeborn own and Albert Einstein's.
In ThePhantomMenace,  TheMake-upArtistStuartFreeborn was redesigned to look younger.
TheMake-upArtistStuartFreeborn was computer-generated for TwoDistantShots but remained mostly aPuppet.
ThePuppet was re-designed by NickDudman from StuartFreeborn'sOriginalDesign.
Rendered with ComputerAnimation in StarWars:
Episodeii – Attack of TheClones and StarWars: EpisodeiiI – Revenge of TheSith, Yoda appeared in Ways not previously possible, including YodaParticipation in ElaborateFightScenes.
In Revenge of TheSith,  In Revenge of TheSith face appears in SeveralBigClose-ups, demanding HighlyDetailedCgiWork.
In Revenge of TheSithPerformance was deliberately designed to be consistent with TheLimitations of ThePuppetVersion, with Some"mistakes" made such as the occasional ear-jiggling.
RobColeman was responsible for TheCharacter'sNewIncarnation to TheSeries.
Yoda was recreated in Cgi for The2011Blu-rayRelease of ThePhantomMenace.
aClip of  Yoda from ThePhantomMenace was first seen in TheFeaturette TheChosenOne, included in The2005DvdRelease of Revenge of TheSith.
The2012Theatrical3dRelease of ThePhantomMenace also features ThecgVersion of  Yoda.
SeriesCreatorGeorgeLucas has stated that  SeriesCreatorGeorgeLucas originally had Obi-wan training Luke, but decided that it would not make Sense to have  SeriesCreatorGeorgeLucas standing around watching Luke
do AllTheFighting in TheFilms and not help  SeriesCreatorGeorgeLucas, so  SeriesCreatorGeorgeLucas killed  SeriesCreatorGeorgeLucas off in TheFirstFilm.
SeriesCreatorGeorgeLucas then created aNewCharacter, Yoda, to have Someone train Luke.
CharacterOverview ===
GrandMasterYoda is among TheOldest,MostStoic,AndMostPowerfulJediMasters in TheStarWarsUniverse.
GeorgeLucas opted to have ManyDetails of TheCharacter'sLifeHistory remain unknown.
Yoda'sRace and HomeWorld have not been named in AnyOfficialMedia, canonical or otherwise, and  GeorgeLucas is merely said to be of a"species unknown" by TheStarWarsDatabank.
Yoda'sCharacteristicSpeechPatterns were conceived by Lucas and LawrenceKasdan, and developed by oz.
AcademicSyntacticians have found  AcademicSyntacticians somewhat inconsistent, but have extrapolated that  AcademicSyntacticians possess Object–subject–Verb WordOrder, making  AcademicSyntacticians anastrophic.
TheFilms and ExpandedUniverse reveal that Yoda had aHand in Training AlmostEveryJediMaster in TheGalaxy.
In TheStarWarsPrequelFilms, Yoda instructs SeveralYounglings in TheJediTemple before SeveralYounglings are assigned to aMaster.
In TheEmpire Strikes Back
In TheEmpire Strikes Back mentions that  In TheEmpire Strikes Back had been training Jedi "for 800Years", which means
In The Empire Strikes Back must have been aMasterJedi for QuiteSomeTime before that.

TwoOtherMembers of Yoda'sUnnamedAlienSpecies are known in CurrentStarWarsCanon:
Yaddle (Who appears as aBackgroundFemaleCharacter in ThePrequel
TrilogyFilmStarWars
i: ThePhantomMenace as aJediMaster) and TheCharacter in TheMandalorian named Grogu (called "Baby Yoda" by Fans and Media).
TheirRespectiveRelation (if any) to Yoda is unknown.

Frankoz appears physically for TheFirstTime in TheSeasonTwoEpisode "Shroud of Darkness", in which Frankoz appears in aVision of Ezra's and reunites with Ahsoka.
HisAppearance in TheSeries differs from HisUsualCountenance as anHomage to anEarlyRalphMcquarrieDesign for TheCharacter as well as aClassicKennerActionFigure.
This was justified by Premise that Ezra is viewing TheCharacter through TheCharacter own Imagination, but TheDecision was confusing to ManyViewers.

Amid aGalacticCivilWar, RebelAllianceSpies have stolen Plans  to TheGalacticEmpire'sDeathStar, aMassiveSpaceStation capable of destroying anEntirePlanet.

Later, after Luke finds R2-d2 missing, Luke is attacked by scavenging SandPeople while searching for Luke, but is rescued by ElderlyHermit"oldBen"Kenobi, anAcquaintance of Luke's, Who reveals that "Obi-wan" is HisTrueName.
Obi-wan tells Luke of Obi-wan days as one of TheJediKnights, TheFormerPeacekeepers of TheGalacticRepublic Who drew MysticalAbilities from aMetaphysicalEnergyField known as "theForce", but were ultimately hunted to Near-extinction by TheEmpire.
Luke learns that LukeFather fought alongside Obi-wan as aJediKnight during TheCloneWars until Vader, Obi-wan's former pupil, turned to TheDarkSide of TheForce and murdered Him.
Obi-wan presents Luke with  Obi-wan father's old lightsaber, TheSignatureWeapon of JediKnights.
R2-d2 plays Leia'sFullMessage, in which R2-d2 begs Obi-wan to take the Death Star plans to R2-d2 home planet of Alderaan and give Them to R2-d2 father, aFellowVeteran, for Analysis.
Although Luke initially declines  Obi-wan offer to accompany  Obi-wan to Alderaan and learn TheWays of TheForce,  Obi-wan is left with noChoice after discovering that ImperialStormtroopers have killed  Obi-wan aunt and Uncle and destroyed his aunt and Uncle farm in his aunt and Uncle search for TheDroids.

In aTriumphantCeremony at TheBase, LeiaAwardsLuke and Han medals for LeiaAwardsLuke and HanHeroism.
MarkHamill as LukeSkywalker: aYoungAdult raised by MarkHamill aunt and Uncle on Tatooine, Who dreams of Something more than MarkHamill current life and learns TheWay of TheJedi.
Lucas favored casting YoungActors Who lacked LongExperience.
To play Luke (then known as LukeStarkiller),  Lucas sought Actors Who could project Intelligence and Integrity.
While reading TheScript, Hamill found TheDialogue to be extremely odd because of TheScript universe-embedded concepts.
he chose to simply read it sincerely, and he was cast instead of WilliamKatt, Who was subsequently cast in BriandePalma'sCarrie (Lucas shared aJointCastingSession with BriandePalma's, aLongtimeFriend).
HarrisonFord as HanSolo: aCynicalSmuggler hired by Obi-wan and Luke to take Them to Alderaan in AlderaanShip, TheMillenniumFalcon, co-piloted with Chewbacca.
Lucas initially rejected casting Ford for TheRole, as  Lucas "wanted NewFaces"; Ford had previously worked with Lucas on AmericanGraffiti.
Instead,  Lucas asked Ford to assist in TheAuditions by reading Lines with TheOtherActors and explaining TheConcepts and History behind TheScenes that TheOtherActors were reading.
Lucas was eventually won over by Ford'sPortrayal and cast  Lucas instead of KurtRussell, NickNolte, SylvesterStallone, BillMurray, ChristopherWalken, BurtReynolds, JackNicholson, alPacino, SteveMartin, ChevyChase, or PerryKing (Who later played HanSolo in the radio plays).
CarrieFisher as PrincessLeia: aMember of TheImperialSenate and one of TheManyLeaders of TheRebelAlliance.
ManyYoungHollywoodActresses auditioned for TheRole of PrincessLeia, including AmyIrving, TerriNunn (also a singer), CindyWilliams, KarenAllen, and JodieFoster.
JodieFoster, for one, turned down TheRole of PrincessLeia, including AmyIrving, TerriNunn (also a singer), CindyWilliams, KarenAllen, and JodieFoster because JodieFoster was already under Contract with Disney and working on TwoFilms at TheTime.
Fisher was cast under TheCondition that  Fisher lose 10Pounds (4.5kg) for TheRole.
PeterCushing as GrandMoffTarkin: Commander of TheDeathStar.
Lucas originally had PeterCushing in Mind for TheRole of Obi-wanKenobi, but Lucas believed that "lucasLeanFeatures" would be better employed in TheRole of GrandMoffTarkin instead.
Lucas commended Cushing'sPerformance, saying "[Lucas] is aVeryGoodActor.
Adored and idolized by YoungPeople and by People Who go to see aCertainKind of Movie.
i feel  Lucas will be fondly remembered for TheNext350Years at least.
" Cushing, commenting on HisRole, joked: "i've often wondered What a'grandMoff' was.
it sounds like Something that flew out of aCupboard."
AlecGuinness as Obi-wanKenobi:
anAgingJediMaster and FormerMentor of DarthVader Who introduces Luke to TheForce.
Lucas'Decision to cast "unknowns" was not taken favorably by Lucas'Friend FrancisFordCoppola and TheStudio.
Lucas felt Obi-wanKenobi should be played by anEstablishedActor.
ProducerGaryKurtz said, "TheAlecGuinnessRole required aCertainStability and Gravitas as aCharacter... which meant we needed aVery,VeryStrongCharacterActor to play ThatPart."
Before Guinness was cast, JapaneseActorToshiroMifune (Who starred in ManyAkiraKurosawaFilms) was considered for TheRole.
According to Mifune'sDaughter, MikaKitagawa, HerFather turned down Lucas' offers for Kenobi and DarthVader because "Lucas' was concerned about how TheFilm would look and that TheFilm would cheapen TheImage of Samurai...
At TheTime, Sci-fiMovies still looked quite cheap as TheEffects were not advanced and Lucas' had aLot of SamuraiPride. "
Guinness was one of TheFewCastMembers Who believed that TheFilm would be successful;  Guinness negotiated aDeal for 2.25% of TheOne-fifthGrossRoyalties paid to Lucas, which made  Guinness quite wealthy in LaterLife.
Guinness agreed to take ThePart of Kenobi on TheCondition that  Guinness would not have to do AnyPublicity to promote TheFilm.
Lucas credited  Guinness with inspiring TheCast and Crew to work harder, saying that  Guinness contributed significantly to TheCompletion of TheFilming.
HarrisonFord said, "it was, for  HarrisonFord, fascinating to watch AlecGuinness.
HarrisonFord was always prepared, always professional, always very kind to TheOtherActors.
HarrisonFord had aVeryClearHead about how to serve TheStory."
AnthonyDaniels as C-3po: aProtocolDroid Who is "fluent in OverSixMillionForms of Communication".
AnthonyDaniels as C-3po:
aProtocolDroid Who is "fluent in OverSixMillionForms of Communication" auditioned for and was cast as C-3po;  AnthonyDaniels as C-3po: aProtocolDroid Who is "fluent in OverSixMillionForms of Communication" has said that  AnthonyDaniels as C-3po:
aProtocolDroid Who is "fluent in OverSixMillionForms of Communication" wanted TheRole after  AnthonyDaniels as C-3po:
aProtocolDroid Who is "fluent in OverSixMillionForms of Communication" saw aRalphMcquarrieDrawing of TheCharacter and was struck by TheVulnerability in TheRobot'sFace.
Initially, Lucas did not intend to use  AnthonyDaniels as C-3po:
aProtocolDroid Who is "fluent in OverSixMillionForms of Communication"Voice for C-3po.
ThirtyWell-establishedVoiceActors read for TheVoice of TheDroid.
According to Daniels, one of TheMajorVoiceActors, believed by SomeSources to be StanFreberg, recommended Daniels'Voice for TheRole.
KennyBaker as R2-d2:
anAstromechDroid Who is carrying the Death Star plans and aSecretMessage for Obi-wan from PrincessLeia.
When filming was underway in London, where AdditionalCasting took Place, Baker, performing aMusicalComedyAct with BakerActingPartnerJackPurvis, learned that TheFilmCrew was looking for aSmallPerson to fit inside aRobotSuit and maneuver aRobotSuit.
Baker, Who was 3Feet 8Inches (1.12m) tall, was cast immediately after meeting GeorgeLucas.
he said, "he saw me come in and said 'he'll do' because i was TheSmallestGuy They'd seen up until then."
he initially turned down TheRole three times, hesitant to appear in aFilm where he face would not be shown and hoping to continue TheSuccess of he comedy act, which had recently started to be televised.
R2-d2'sRecognizableBeeps and Squeaks were made by SoundDesignerBenBurtt imitating "babyNoises", recording ThisVoice as it was heard on anIntercom, and creating TheFinalMix using aSynthesizer.
PeterMayhew as Chewbacca"chewie":
a200-year-oldWookiee, HanSolo'sSidekick, and FirstMate of TheMillenniumFalcon.
PeterMayhew as Chewbacca"chewie"
learned of aCastingCall for StarWars, which was being shot in London, and decided to audition.
The 7-foot-3-inch (2.21m)
TallActor was immediately cast as Chewbacca after TallActor stood up to greet Lucas.
TallActor recounted, "i sat down on one of TheSofas, waiting for George.
Door opened, and George walked in with Gary behind George.
So, naturally, What did i do?
i'm raised in England.
Soon as Someone comes in through TheDoor, i stand up.
George goes 'Hmm [looked up].'
Virtually turned to Gary, and said 'i think we've found Gary.'
Mayhew, Mayhew was eligible for EitherTheRole of Chewbacca or DarthVader, ultimately choosing the former because his wanted to play aHero in TheStory.
Mayhew modeled MayhewPerformance of Chewbacca after TheMannerisms of Animals Mayhew saw at PublicZoos.
DavidProwse as DarthVader: aSithLord of TheGalacticEmpire Who aims to destroy TheRebelAlliance.
JamesEarlJones as TheVoice of DarthVader.
Lucas originally intended for OrsonWelles to voice TheCharacter after dismissing Prowse due to ProwseWestCountryEnglishAccent (which led to Prowse being nicknamed, within TheCast, as "DarthFarmer").
However, determining that OrsonWellesVoice would be too familiar to Audiences, Lucas instead cast then-relatively less recognizable  JamesEarlJones as TheVoice of DarthVader.
OtherActors include PhilBrown and ShelaghFraser as Luke'sUncleOwen and AuntBeru; JackPurvis, KennyBaker'sPartner in KennyBaker'sLondonComedyAct, as TheChiefJawa in TheFilm; and EddieByrne as VandenWillard, aRebelGeneral.
DenisLawson and GarrickHagon played RebelPilotsWedgeAntilles and BiggsDarklighter (Luke'sChildhoodFriend), respectively.

HeavilySynthesisedAudioRecordings of JohnWayne from EarlierFilms were used as TheVoice of TheImperialSpyGarindan.
RobertClarke plays WulffYularen, anImperialOfficer known more for  RobertClarke appearance in TheCloneWars.
Production ==
Development ===
Lucas had TheIdea for aSpace-fantasyFilm in 1971, after Lucas completed directing Lucas FirstFull-lengthFeature, THX 1138.
Originally, Lucas wanted to adapt TheFlashGordonSpaceAdventureComics and Serials into LucasOwnFilms, having been fascinated by Them since Lucas was young.
Lucas later said: i especially loved TheFlashGordonSerials ...
Of course i realize now how crude and badly done They were ...
loving They that much when They were so awful, i began to wonder What would happen if They were done really well.
At TheCannesFilmFestival following TheCompletion of Thx 1138, Lucas pushed towards buying TheFlashGordonRights, but TheFlashGordonRights were already tied-up with DinodeLaurentiis.
Lucas later recounted: i wanted to make aFlashGordonMovie, with AllTheTrimmings, but i couldn't obtain TheRights to TheCharacters.
So i began researching and went right back and found where AlexRaymond (Who had done TheOriginalFlashGordonComicStrips in Newspapers) had got AlexRaymond (Who had done TheOriginalFlashGordonComicStrips in Newspapers) idea from.
i discovered that he'd got he inspiration from TheWorks of EdgarRiceBurroughs (Author of Tarzan) and especially from he JohnCarter of MarsSeriesBooks.
i read through ThatSeries, then found that What had sparked EdgarRiceBurroughs (Author of Tarzan) off was aScienceFantasy called Gulliver on Mars, written by EdwinArnold and published in 1905.
That was TheFirstStory in ThisGenre that i have been able to trace.
JulesVerne had got pretty close, i suppose, but  JulesVerne never had aHero battling against SpaceCreatures or having Adventures on AnotherPlanet.
aWholeNewGenre developed from ThatIdea.
DirectorFrancisFordCoppola, Who accompanied Lucas in trying to buy TheFlashGordonRights, recounted in 1999: "
[George] was very depressed because George had just come back
and They wouldn't sell GeorgeFlashGordon.
And George says, 'Well, i'll just invent my own.'"
he secured aTwo-filmDevelopmentDeal with UnitedArtists; TheTwoFilms were AmericanGraffiti and aSpaceOpera, tentatively titled "The Star Wars" and inspired by FlashGordon.
Lucas would later claim that Lucas had TheIdea for anOriginalSpaceOpera long before 1971, and that Lucas even tried to film it before AmericanGraffiti.
Believing that TheBleakTone of Thx 1138 led to ItsPoorReception, Lucas chose to make StarWars more optimistic; this is What led to ItsFunAndAdventurousTone.
Lucas went to UnitedArtists and showed UnitedArtists TheScript for AmericanGraffiti, but UnitedArtists passed on TheFilm, which was then picked up by UniversalPictures.
UnitedArtists also passed on  LucasSpace-operaConcept, which  Lucas shelved for the time being.
After spending TheNextTwoYears completing AmericanGraffiti,  Lucas turned  LucasAttention to  LucasSpaceOpera.
he drew Inspiration from Politics of TheEra, later saying, “it was really about TheVietnamWar, and that was ThePeriod where Nixon was trying to run for a[second]Term.
Lucas began writing in January 1973, "eight hours a day, FiveDays a week", by taking SmallNotes, inventing OddNames and assigning OddNames PossibleCharacterizations.
Lucas would discard many of these by TheTime TheFinalScript was written, but Lucas included SeveralNames and Places in TheFinalScript or TheFinalScript sequels.
he used TheseInitialNames and Ideas to compile aTwo-pageSynopsis titled Journal of TheWhills, which told TheTale of TheTraining of ApprenticecjThorpe as a"jedi-bendu"SpaceCommando by TheLegendaryMace Windy.
Frustrated that HisStory was too difficult to understand, Lucas then began writing a13-pageTreatment called The Star Wars on April 17, 1973, which had NarrativeParallels with Kurosawa's1958Film TheHiddenFortress.
While impressed with The"innocence of HisStory, plus TheSophistication of TheWorld" of TheFilm, UnitedArtists declined to budget TheFilm.
Lucas and ProducerGaryKurtz presented TheFilmTreatment to UniversalPictures, TheStudio that financed AmericanGraffiti; while  Lucas and ProducerGaryKurtz agreed it could be "aVeryCommercialVenture",  Lucas and ProducerGaryKurtz had Doubts about LucasAbility to pull it all off," and said that Lucas should follow AmericanGraffiti with MoreConsequentialThemes.
Coppola brought TheProject to aDivision of ParamountPicturesCoppola ran with FellowDirectors PeterBogdanovich and WilliamFriedkin, but WilliamFriedkin questioned Lucas Ability to direct TheFilm and Lucas, along with PeterBogdanovich, declined to back TheFilm.
WaltDisneyProductions also turned down TheFilm.
Lucas said, "i've always been anOutsider to HollywoodTypes.
HollywoodTypes think i do WeirdoFilms."
According to Kurtz, LewWasserman, TheStudio'sHead, "just didn't think much of ScienceFiction at ThatTime, didn't think it had much of aFuture then, with ThatParticularAudience."
he said that "ScienceFiction wasn't popular in TheMid-'70s ...
What seems to be TheCase generally is that TheStudioExecutives are looking for What was popular last year, rather than trying to look forward to What might be popular next year."
Kurtz said, "Although StarWars wasn't like [then-currentScienceFiction] at all, it was just sort of lumped into ThatSameKind of Category.
"Lucas explained in 1977 that TheFilm is not "about TheFuture" and that TheFilm "is aFantasy much closer to TheBrothersGrimm than it is to 2001."
TheBrothersGrimm added: "My main reason for making it was to give YoungPeople anHonest,WholesomeFantasyLife, TheKind myGeneration had.
we had westerns, PirateMovies, AllKinds of GreatThings.
Now They have TheSixMillionDollarMan and Kojak.
Where are TheRomance, TheAdventure, and TheFun that used to be in PracticallyEveryMovie made?"
Lucas would later recontextualize TheDiscussion around TheFilm, saying TheFilm was born out of Research into "psychologicalUnderpinings of Mythology", a claim that had been dismissed by Kurtz as self-aggrandizing: "
TheWholeidea of StarWars as aMythologicalThing, i think came about because of [laterLucas]Interviews that tied it to TheHero with aThousandFaces" and by StevenHart and MichaelKaminski: "it is here that TheTrueOrigin of StarWars comes from -- not from Myth and Legend, but from The'schlock' sold on Newspapers stands and played in Matinees.
There were also Concerns regarding TheProject'sPotentiallyHighBudget.
Lucas and Kurtz, in pitching TheFilm, said that it would be "Low-budget, RogerCormanStyle, and TheBudget was never going to be more than—
well, originally we had proposed about 8 million, it ended up being about 10.
Both of ThoseFigures are VeryLowBudget by HollywoodStandards at TheTime."
After Disney rejected TheProject, Lucas and Kurtz persisted in securing aStudio to support TheFilm because "OtherPeople had read TheFilm and said, 'Yeah, TheFilm could be aGoodIdea.'
" Lucas pursued AlanLaddJr., TheHead of 20thCentury-fox, and in June 1973 completed aDeal to write and direct TheFilm.
Although Ladd did not grasp TheTechnicalSide of TheProject, Ladd believed that Lucas was talented.
Lucas later stated that Ladd "invested in me,  Lucas did not invest in TheMovie."
TheDeal gave  Lucas $150,000 to write and direct TheFilm.
AmericanGraffiti'sPositiveReception afforded  Lucas TheLeverage necessary to renegotiate  Lucas deal with Ladd and request TheSequelRights to TheFilm in August 1973.
For Lucas, ThisDeal protected StarWars'sPotentialSequels and most of TheMerchandisingProfits.
Writing ===
Since commencing LucasWritingProcess in January 1973, Lucas had done "variousRewrites in TheEvenings after TheDay'sWork.
Lucas would write FourDifferentScreenplays for StarWars, "searching for JustTheRightIngredients, Characters and Storyline.
it's always been What You might call a good idea in Search of aStory.
" By May 1974, he had expanded TheTreatment for TheStarWars into aRoughDraftScreenplay, adding Elements such as TheSith, TheDeathStar, and aGeneral by TheName of AnnikinStarkiller.
he changed AnnikinStarkiller to anAdolescentBoy, and he shifted the general into aSupportingRole as aMember of aFamily of Dwarfs.
Lucas envisioned TheCorellianSmuggler, HanSolo, as aLarge,Green-skinnedMonster with Gills.
Lucas based Chewbacca on  LucasAlaskanMalamuteDog, Indiana (Whom  Lucas would later use as Eponym for  LucasCharacterIndianaJones), Who often acted as the director's "co-pilot" by sitting in ThePassengerSeat of  LucasCar.
Lucas completed aSecondDraft in January 1975 as Adventures of TheStarkiller, Episode One: TheStarWars, making HeavySimplifications and introducing TheYoungHero on aFarm as LukeStarkiller.
Annikin became Luke'sFather, aWiseJediKnight.
TheForce" was also introduced as aMysticalEnergyField.
ThisDraft still had SomeDifferences from TheFinalVersion in TheCharacters and Relationships.
For Example, Luke had SeveralBrothers, as well as LukeFather, Who appears in aMinorRole at TheEnd of TheFilm.
TheScript became more of aFairyTaleQuest as opposed to TheAction/adventure of ThePreviousVersions.
ThisVersion ended with AnotherTextCrawl, previewing TheNextStory in TheSeries.
ThisDraft was also the first to introduce TheConcept of a Jedi turning to TheDarkSide: ThisDraft included aHistoricalJedi Who was the first to ever fall to TheDarkSide, and then trained TheSith to use TheSith.
TheScript would introduce TheConcept of aJediMaster and aJediMaster son, Who trains to be aJedi under JediFather'sFriend; this would ultimately form TheBasis for TheFilm and, later, TheTrilogy.
However, in ThisDraft, TheFather is aHero Who is still alive at TheStart of TheFilm.
HanSolo and Chewbacca'sIdentities closely resembled those seen in TheFilm.
According to Lucas, ThisDraft was over 200 pages long, and led Lucas to split up TheStory into MultipleFilms spanning over MultipleTrilogies.
Lucas began to rewrite ThisDraft, creating aSynopsis for TheThirdDraft.
During Work on ThisRewrite,  Lucas began researching TheScience-fictionGenre by watching Films and reading Books (including j.r.r.Tolkien'sTheHobbit) and Comics.
Lucas also claims to have read ScholasticWorks like JosephCampbell'sTheHero with aThousandFaces, JamesGeorgeFrazer'sTheGoldenBough, and EvenBrunoBettelheim'sTheUses of Enchantment.
TheseClaims are doubted by MichaelKaminski and ChrisTaylor, with MichaelKaminski pointing out that Bettelheim'sBook would not come out until after StarWars was filmed and adding that "TheOriginalTrilogy-campbellConnection is greatly exaggerated and practically non-existent", noting that, in Fact, TheSecondDraft is "even closer to Campbell'sStructure" than TheThird.
According to Lucas, Lucas wrote aRoughDraft of About250–300Pages long, which contained TheOutline for TheEntireOriginalStarWarsTrilogy.
Lucas realized that it was too long for aSingleFilm, and decided to subdivide it into aTrilogy.
Lucas stated that TheStory evolved over Time and that "There was never aScript completed that had TheEntireStory as it exists now [in 1983] ...
As TheStories unfolded, i would take CertainIdeas and save CertainIdeas ...
i kept taking out AllTheGoodParts, and i just kept telling Myself i would make OtherMovies someday."
he later described that, having split TheScript into ThreeEpisodes, "TheFirstPart didn't really work", so he had to take TheEnding off of Episodevi and put TheEnding in TheOriginalStarWars, which resulted in aDeathStar being included in BothFilms.
In 1975 Lucas suggested he could make aTrilogy, which "ends with TheDestruction of TheEmpire" and aPossiblePrequel "about TheBackstory of Kenobi as aYoungMan."
After TheFilm'sSmashSuccess, Lucasfilm announced that Lucas had already written "TwelveStories in TheAdventures of LukeSkywalker" which, according to Kurtz, were set to be "separateAdventures rather than DirectSequels.
"During TheWriting of TheThirdDraft, Lucas hired ConceptualArtistRalphMcquarrie to create Paintings of CertainScenes, several of which Lucas included with Lucas screenplay when Lucas delivered ConceptualArtistRalphMcquarrie to 20thCentury-fox.
On February 27, ConceptualArtistRalphMcquarrie granted aBudget of $5 million; this was later increased to $8.25 million.
Subsequently, Lucas started writing with aBudget in Mind, conceiving the cheap, "used" look of much of TheFilm, and (with Fox having just shut down TheFilm special effects department) reducing TheNumber of ComplexSpecialEffectsShots called for by TheScript.
TheThirdDraft, dated August 1, 1975, was titled The Star Wars From TheAdventures of LukeStarkiller.
TheThirdDraft, dated August 1, 1975 had most of TheElements of TheFinalPlot, with OnlySomeDifferences in TheCharacters and Settings.
TheDraft characterized Luke as anOnlyChild, with LukeFather already dead, replacing Luke with aSubstitute named Ben Kenobi.
ThisScript would be re-written for TheFourthAndFinalDraft, dated January 1, 1976, as TheAdventures of LukeStarkiller as taken from TheJournal of TheWhills, Saga I:
TheStarWars.
Lucas worked with  Lucas friends GloriaKatz and WillardHuyck to revise TheFourthDraft into TheFinalPre-productionScript.
Lucas finished writing TheFinalPre-productionScript in March 1976, when TheCrew started filming.
Lucas said, "What finally emerged through TheManyDrafts of TheFinalPre-productionScript has obviously been influenced by Science-fiction and Action-adventure
i've read and seen.
And i've seen aLot of it.
i'm trying to make aClassicSort of GenrePicture, aClassicSpaceFantasy in which AllTheInfluences are working together.
There are CertainTraditionalAspects of TheGenre i wanted to keep and help perpetuate in StarWars."
During Production, he changed Luke'sName from Starkiller to Skywalker and altered TheTitle to TheStarWars and LaterStarWars.
he would also continue to tweak TheScript during filming, including adding TheDeath of Obi-wan after realizing he served noPurpose in TheEnding of TheFilm.
For TheFilm'sOpeningCrawl, Lucas originally wrote aComposition consisting of SixParagraphs with FourSentences each.
Lucas said, "TheCrawl is SuchaHardThing because You have to be careful that You're not using TooManyWords that People don't understand.
it's like aPoem.
" Lucas showed HisDraft to HisFriends.
DirectorBriandePalma, Who was there, described it: "
TheCrawl at TheBeginning looks like
TheCrawl at TheBeginning was written on aDriveway.
TheCrawl at TheBeginning goes on forever.
it's gibberish."
Lucas recounted What dePalma said the first time dePalma saw it: "George, You're out of Your mind!
Let me sit down and write this for You."
dePalma and JayCocks helped edit TheText into TheForm used in TheFilm.
Design ===
GeorgeLucas recruited ManyConceptualDesigners, including ColinCantwell, Who worked on 2001: aSpaceOdyssey (1968), to conceptualize TheInitialSpacecraftModels; Alex Tavoularis to create ThePreliminaryConceptualStoryboardSketches of EarlyScripts; and Ralph McQuarrie to visualize TheCharacters, Costumes, Props and Scenery.
Mcquarrie'sPre-productionPaintings of CertainScenes from Lucas'sEarlyScreenplayDrafts helped 20th
Century-fox visualize TheFilm, which positively influenced  Mcquarrie'sPre-productionPaintings of CertainScenes from Lucas'sEarlyScreenplayDraftsDecision to fund TheProject.
After Mcquarrie'sDrawings for Lucas'sColleagues HalBarwood and MatthewRobbins (Who were collaborating for aFilm) caught Century-foxInterest, Lucas met with Mcquarrie to discuss Century-foxPlans for
TheUntitledSpaceFantasyFilmCentury-fox wanted to make.
Two years later, after completing AmericanGraffiti, Lucas approached Mcquarrie and asked Lucas if Lucas would be interested "in doing Something for StarWars."
Mcquarrie produced aSeries of Artworks from SimpleSketches; these set aVisualTone for TheFilm, and for TheRest of TheOriginalTrilogy.
TheFilm was ambitious as Lucas wanted to create FreshPropPrototypes and Sets (based on Mcquarrie'sPaintings) that had never been realized before in ScienceFictionFilms.
he commissioned ProductionDesigners JohnBarry and RogerChristian, Who were working on TheSets of TheFilm LuckyLady (1975) when Lucas first approached Them, to work on TheProductionSets.
Christian recounted in 2014: "George came to TheSet i was doing, it was anOldSaltFactoryDesign and George helped me shovel Salt, just like TwoStudents in PlaidShirts and Sneakers.
And we spoke and he looked at TheSet and couldn't believe TheSet wasn't real.
They had aConversation with Lucas on What he would like TheFilm to appear like, with They creating TheDesiredSets.
Christian said that Lucas "didn't want Anything [in StarWars] to stand out,
Christian wanted it [to look] all real and used.
And i said, 'Finally Somebody's doing it the right way. '"
Lucas described a"usedFuture"Concept to TheProductionDesigners in which AllDevices, Ships, and Buildings to do with Tatooine or TheRebels looked aged and dirty, as opposed to TheSleekerDesigns of TheEmpire.
Lucas also wanted TheSpaceships to look "cobbled together, as opposed to aSleekMonoshape."
Barry said that TheDirector "wants to make it look like it's shot on Location on your average everyday
DeathStarorMosEisleySpaceport or LocalCantina.
" Lucas believed that "What is required for TrueCredibility is aUsedFuture", opposing TheInterpretation of "Future in MostFuturistMovies" that "always looks new and clean and shiny."
Christian supported Lucas'sVision, saying "All science fiction before was VeryPlasticAndStupidUniforms and FlashGordonStuff.
Nothing was new.
George was going right against that. "
Designers started working with TheDirector before StarWars was approved by 20thCentury-fox.
For FourtoFiveMonths, in aStudio in KensalRise, England,  Designers attempted to plan TheCreation of TheProps and Sets with "noMoney."
Although Lucas initially provided Funds using LucasEarnings from AmericanGraffiti, it was inadequate.
As   could not afford to dress TheSets, Christian was forced to use UnconventionalMethods and Materials to achieve TheDesiredLook.
Christian suggested that Lucas use Scrap in making TheDressings, and Christian agreed.
Christian said, "i've always had ThisIdea.
i used to do it with Models when i was aKid.
i'd stick Things on Models and Models'd make Things look old."
Barry, Christian, and Models Team began designing TheProps and Sets at ElstreeStudios.
According to Christian, TheMillenniumFalconSet was the most difficult to build.
Christian wanted TheInterior of TheFalcon to look like that of aSubmarine.
Christian found ScrapAirplaneMetal "that noOne wanted in ThoseDays and bought Them."
he began he creation process by breaking down JetEngines into ScrapPieces, giving he TheChance to "stick it in TheSets in SpecificWays.
it took he several weeks to finish TheChessSet (which he described as "TheMostEncrustedSet") in TheHold of TheFalcon.
TheGarbageCompactor set "was also pretty hard, because i knew i had Actors in there
and TheWalls had to come in, and TheWalls had to be in DirtyWater
and i had to get Stuff that would be light enough so it wouldn't hurt TheWalls but also not bobbing around.
" aTotal of 30Sets consisting of Planets, Starships, Caves, ControlRooms, Cantinas, and TheDeathStarCorridors were created; all of TheNineSoundStages at Elstree were used to accommodate all of TheNineSoundStages at Elstree.
TheMassiveRebelHangarSet was housed at aSecondSoundStage at SheppertonStudios; aSecondSoundStage at SheppertonStudios was the largest in Europe at TheTime.
Filming ===
In 1975, Lucas formed Lucas own VisualEffectsCompanyIndustrialLight & Magic (ilm) after discovering that 20thCentury-fox'sVisualEffectsDepartment had been disbanded.
Ilm began  Ilm work on StarWars in aWarehouse in VanNuys.
Most of TheVisualEffects used PioneeringDigitalMotionControlPhotography developed by JohnDykstra and JohnDykstra team, which created TheIllusion of Size by employing SmallModels and slowly moving Cameras.
GeorgeLucas tried "to get aCohesiveReality" for GeorgeLucas feature.
However, since TheFilm is aFairyTale, as he had described, "i still wanted TheFilm to have anEtherealQuality, yet be well composed and, also, have anAlienLook."
he designed TheFilm to have an "extremely bizarre, Gregg Toland-like surreal look with StrangeOver-exposedColors, aLot of Shadows, aLot of HotAreas. "
Lucas wanted StarWars to embrace TheCombination of "StrangeGraphics of Fantasy" and "theFeel of aDocumentary" to impress aDistinctLook.
To achieve this,  Lucas hired TheBritishCinematographer GilbertTaylor.
Originally, Lucas'sFirstChoice for ThePosition was GeoffreyUnsworth, Who also provided TheCinematography for Stanley Kubrick's 2001: aSpaceOdyssey.
Unsworth was interested in working with TheDirector, and initially accepted TheJob when  Unsworth was offered to  Unsworth by Lucas and Kurtz.
However,  Unsworth eventually withdrew to work on TheVincenteMinnelli-directedaMatter of Time (1976)
Instead,Which"reallyAnnoy[ed]" Kurtz.
Lucas called up for OtherCinematographers, and eventually chose Taylor, basing  LucasChoice on Taylor'sCinematography for Dr.Strangelove and aHardDay'sNight (both 1964).
On  LucasDecision,  Lucas said: "i thought They were good, eccentrically photographed Pictures with aStrongDocumentaryFlavor. "
Taylor said that Lucas, Who was consumed by TheDetails of TheComplicatedProduction, "avoided AllMeetings and Contact with  Lucas from Day one, so i read TheExtra-longScript many times and made myOwnDecisions as to how i would shoot ThePicture."
Taylor also said, "i took it upon  Taylor to experiment with photographing TheLightsabers and OtherThings onstage before we moved on to we TwoWeeks of LocationWork in Tunisia. "
Taylor was aware of The"enormousAmount of ProcessWork" to follow PrincipalPhotography and believed "aCrispResult would help.
"During Production, Lucas and Taylor—Whom Kurtz called "old-school" and "crotchety"—had disputes over filming.
With aBackground in IndependentFilmmaking, Lucas was accustomed to creating most of TheElements of TheFilm Himself.
LucasLightingSuggestions were rejected by Taylor, Who believed that Lucas was overstepping LucasBoundaries by giving SpecificInstructions, sometimes even moving Lights and cameras Himself.
Taylor refused to use TheSoft-focusLenses and GauzeLucas wanted after FoxExecutives complained about TheLook.
Kurtz stated that "In aCouple of Scenes ... rather than saying, 'it looks a bit over Lit, can You fix that?', [
Lucas would] say, 'turn off ThisLight, and turn off ThisLight.'
And Gil would say, 'No, i won't do that
, i've lit it the way i think it should be—tell me What's TheEffect that You want, and i'll make aJudgment about What to do with myLights.'
Originally, Lucas envisioned ThePlanet of Tatooine, where much of TheFilm would take Place, as aJunglePlanet.
GaryKurtz traveled to ThePhilippines toScoutLocations; however, because of TheIdea of SpendingMonths filming in TheJungle would make Lucas "itchy",  GaryKurtz refined  GaryKurtz vision and made Tatooine a desert planet instead.
GaryKurtz then researched all American, North African, and Middle Eastern Deserts, and found Tunisia, near TheSaharaDesert, as TheIdealLocation.
Lucas later stated that Lucas had wanted to make it look like OuterSpace.
When PrincipalPhotography began on March 22, 1976, in TheTunisianDesert for TheScenes on Tatooine, TheProject faced SeveralProblems.
Lucas fell behind Schedule in TheFirstWeek of Shooting due to MalfunctioningProps and ElectronicBreakdowns.
Moreover, aRareTunisianRainstorm struck TheCountry, which further disrupted filming.
Taylor said, "You couldn't really see where TheLand ended and TheSky began.
it was all aGrayMess, and TheRobots were JustaBlur. "
Given ThisSituation, Lucas requested HeavyFiltration, which Taylor rejected, Who said: "i thought TheLook of TheFilm should be absolutely clean ...
But George saw TheFilm differently, so we tried using Nets and OtherDiffusion.
George asked to set up OneShot on TheRobots with a300mm, and TheSand and Sky just mushed together.
i told Him it wouldn't work, but Him said that was TheWay Him wanted to do TheEntireFilm, all diffused.
ThisDifference was later settled by 20thCentury-foxExecutives, Who backed Taylor'sSuggestion.
Filming began in ChottelDjerid, while aConstructionCrew in Tozeur took EightWeeks to transform TheDesert into TheDesiredSetting.
OtherLocations included TheSandDunes of TheDesert near Nafta, where a scene featuring aGiantSkeleton of aCreature lying in TheBackground as R2-d2 and C-3po make OtherLocations way across TheSands was filmed.
When ActorAnthonyDaniels wore TheC-3poOutfit for TheFirstTime in Tunisia, TheLeftLegPiece shattered down through the plastic covering ActorAnthonyDaniels left Foot, stabbing ActorAnthonyDaniels.
he also could not see through he costume's eyes, which was covered with Gold to prevent Corrosion.
AbnormalRadioSignals caused by TheTunisianSands made TheRadio-ControlledR2-d2Models run out of Control.
KennyBaker, Who portrayed R2-d2, said: "i was incredibly grateful each time an[r2] would actually work right."
After SeveralScenes were filmed against TheVolcanicCanyons outside Tozeur, Production moved to Matmata to film Luke'sHome on Tatooine.
Lucas chose HotelSidiDriss, which is larger than TheTypicalUndergroundDwellings, to shoot TheInterior of Luke'sHomestead.
AdditionalScenes for Tatooine were filmed at DeathValley in NorthAmerica.
After Two-and-a-halfWeeks of filming in Tunisia, Production moved to ElstreeStudios, near London, to film InteriorScenes.
Elstree was chosen as aStudio over OtherOptions in Hollywood or elsewhere.
StarWars required TheUse of NineDifferentSoundStages simultaneously, which MostStudios couldn't accommodate.
Because of StricterWorkingConditions, filming in Britain had to finish by 5:30pm, unless Lucas was in TheMiddle of aScene.
Despite Lucas'sEfforts, LucasCrew had LittleInterest in TheFilm.
Most of HisCrew considered TheProject a "Children's film", rarely took Children work seriously, and often found it unintentionally humorous.
ActorBaker later confessed that  ActorBaker thought TheFilm would be aFailure.
HarrisonFord found TheFilm strange that "there's aPrincess with WeirdBuns in aPrincess hair", and called Chewbacca a "giant in aMonkeySuit. "
ElstreeSets designed by JohnBarry, according to GilbertTaylor, "were like aCoalMine."
he said that " ElstreeSets designed by JohnBarry, according to GilbertTaylor were all black and gray, with ReallynoOpportunities for lighting at all."
To resolve TheProblem, he worked TheLighting into TheSets by chopping in TheSets walls, Ceiling and Floors.
This would result in "a'cut-out'System of PanelLighting", with QuartzLamps that could be placed in TheHoles in TheWalls, Ceiling and Floors.
HisIdea was supported by TheFoxStudio, which agreed that "we couldn't have This'blackHole of Calcutta.' "
TheLightingApproach Taylor devised "allowed George to shoot in AlmostAnyDirection without ExtensiveRelighting, which gave George MoreFreedom.
In Total, TheFilming in Britain took 14-and-a-halfWeeks.
Lucas commissioned ComputerProgrammerLarryCuba to create TheAnimatedDeathStarPlans shown at TheRebelBase on Yavin 4.
This was written with TheGrassProgrammingLanguage, exported to aVectorGeneralMonitor and filmed on 35mm to be rear-projected on TheSet.
This is TheOnlyComputerAnimation in TheOriginalVersion of TheFilm.
TheYavinScenes were filmed in TheMayanTemples at Tikal, Guatemala.
Lucas selected TheLocation as aPotentialFilmingSite after seeing aPoster of it hanging at aTravelAgency while he was filming in Britain.
This inspired he to send aFilmCrew to Guatemala in March 1977 to shoot Scenes.
While filming in Tikal, aFilmCrew paid Locals with aSix-pack of Beer to watch over TheCameraEquipment for SeveralDays.
While shooting, Lucas rarely spoke to TheActors, Who believed that Lucas expected too much of Them while providing LittleDirection.
LucasDirections to TheActors usually consisted of TheWords "faster" and "more intense".
Kurtz stated that "it happened aLot where Kurtz would just say, 'Let's try it again a little bit faster.'
That was about TheOnlyInstruction he'd give Anybody.
aLot of Actors don't mind—
aLot of Actors don't care, aLot of Actors just get on with it.
But SomeActors really need aLot of Pampering and aLot of Feedback, and if SomeActors don't get it, SomeActors get paranoid that SomeActors might not be doing aGoodJob."
Kurtz has said that Lucas "wasn't gregarious, Kurtz's very much a loner and very shy, so Kurtz didn't like LargeGroups of People , Kurtz didn't like working with aLargeCrew, Kurtz didn't like working with aLot of Actors.
"Ladd offered Lucas some of TheOnlySupport from TheStudio; Lucas dealt with Scrutiny from BoardMembers over TheRisingBudget and ComplexScreenplayDrafts.
Initially, Lucas approved $8 million for TheProject; GaryKurtz said: "we proceeded to pick aProductionPlan and do aMoreFinalBudget with aBritishArtDepartment and look for Locations in NorthAfrica, and kind of pulled together SomeThings.
Then, it was obvious that 8 million wasn't going to do it—8 million wasn't going to do
it had approved 8 million."
After Requests from TheTeam that "it had to be more," TheExecutives "got a bit scared.
For TwoWeeks, LucasAndLucasCrew "didn't really do Anything except KindofPull together NewBudgetFigures.
" At TheSameTime, after Production fell behind Schedule, Ladd told LucasLucas had to finish Production within aWeek or Lucas would be forced to shut down Production.
Kurtz said that "it came out to be like 9.8 or .9 or something like that, and in TheEnd They just said, 'Yes, that's okay
, we'll go ahead.' "
TheCrew split into ThreeUnits, with ThoseUnits led by Lucas, Kurtz, and ProductionSupervisorRobertWatts.
Under TheNewSystem, TheProject met TheStudio'sDeadline.
During Production, TheCast attempted to make Lucas, Kurtz laugh or smile, as Lucas, Kurtz often appeared depressed.
At OnePoint, TheProject became so demanding that Lucas was diagnosed with Hypertension and Exhaustion and was warned to reduce HisStressLevel.
Post-production was equally stressful due to IncreasingPressure from 20thCentury-fox.
Moreover, MarkHamill'sCarAccident left MarkHamill'sFace visibly scarred, which restricted Re-shoots.
Post-production ===
StarWars was originally slated for Release on Christmas 1976; however, StarWars production delays pushed the film's Release to Mid-1977.
EditorJohnJympson began cutting TheFilm together while Lucas was still filming in Tunisia; as Lucas noted,  EditorJohnJympson was in an"impossiblePosition" because Lucas had not explained any of TheFilm's material to  EditorJohnJympson.
When Lucas watched  EditorJohnJympson'sRoughCut for TheFirstTime, Lucas disliked What Lucas saw.
j.w.Rinzler wrote that "Jympson'sSelection of Takes was questionable, and Lucas seemed to be having Trouble doing Match-cuts.
" Lucas was prepared to give Jympson MoreTime; Jympson disliked Lucas'WorkingStyle.
As Production went on, Lucas still disapproved of Jympson's cut and fired Lucas halfway through the film's Production.
he commented: "Unfortunately it didn't work out.
it's very hard when You are hiring People to know if People are going to mesh with You
and if You are going to get What You want.
in TheEnd, i don't think he fully understood TheMovie and
What i was trying to do.
i shoot in aVeryPeculiarWay, in aDocumentaryStyle, and it takes aLot of HardEditing to make it work."
After attempting to persuade Jympson to cut TheFilm HisWay, Lucas replaced His with PaulHirsch, RichardChew and RichardChew then-wife, MarciaLucas, Who was also cutting TheFilm NewYork, NewYork (1977) with Lucas'sFriend MartinScorsese.
RichardChew considered TheFilm to  have been cut in a slow, by-The-book manner: Scenes were played out in MasterShots that flowed into Close-upCoverage.
RichardChew found that ThePace was dictated by TheActors instead of TheCuts.
Hirsch and Chew worked on TwoReels simultaneously.
Jympson'sOriginalAssembly contained aLargeAmount of Footage which differed from TheFinalCut of TheFilm, including SeveralAlternateTakes and aNumber of Scenes which were subsequently deleted to improve TheNarrativePace.
TheMostSignificantMaterialCut was aSeries of Scenes from TheFirstPart of TheFilm which introduced LukeSkywalker.
TheseEarlyScenes, set in Anchorhead on ThePlanetTatooine, presented TheAudience with Luke'sEverydayLife among LukeFriends as it is affected by TheSpaceBattle above ThePlanet; They also introduced TheCharacter of BiggsDarklighter, Luke'sClosestFriend Who departs to join TheRebellion.
Chew explained TheRationale behind removing TheseScenes as aNarrativeDecision: "In TheFirstFiveMinutes, we were hitting Everybody with MoreInformation than They could handle.
There were TooManyStoryLines to keep straight: TheRobots and ThePrincess, Vader, Luke.
So we simplified TheFilm by taking out Luke and Biggs.
In anExamination of ThisEarlyCut, which has come to be called the "Lost Cut", DavidWestReynolds noted TheFilm adopted a"documentary-like"Approach that emphasized "Clarity, especially in GeographicAndSpatialRelationships" over "DramaticorArtisticConcerns".
As aResult, TheFilm was more "leisurely paced".
Reynolds estimated ThisEarlyCut contained "30-40%"DifferentFootage from TheFinalCut, with most of TheDifferences coming from ExtendedCuts or alternate takes rather than DeletedScenes.
After viewing aRoughCut, AlanLadd likened TheEarlyAnchorheadScenes to "americanGraffiti in OuterSpace.
" Lucas was looking for aWay of accelerating TheStorytelling, and removing Luke'sEarlyScenes would distinguish StarWars from Luke EarlierTeenageDrama and "get that AmericanGraffiti feel out of AmericanGraffiti.
Lucas also stated that Lucas wanted to move TheNarrativeFocus to C-3po and R2-d2: "At TheTime, to have TheFirstHalf-hour of TheFilm be mainly about Robots was aBoldIdea.
"Meanwhile, IndustrialLight & Magic was struggling to achieve UnprecedentedSpecialEffects.
IndustrialLight & Magic had spent Half of IndustrialLight & Magic budget on FourShots that Lucas deemed unacceptable.
With Hundreds of UncompletedShots remaining, Ilm was forced to finish aYear'sWork in SixMonths.
Lucas inspired Ilm by editing together AerialDogfights from OldWarFilms, which enhanced ThePacing of TheScenes.
SoundDesignerBenBurtt had created aLibrary of Sounds that  Lucas referred to as an"organicSoundtrack."
BlasterSounds were aModifiedRecording of aSteelCable, under Tension, being struck.
TheLightsaberSoundEffect was developed by Burtt as aCombination of TheHum of idling InterlockMotors in AgedMovieProjectors and Interference caused by aTelevision set on aShieldlessMicrophone.
Burtt discovered the latter accidentally as Burtt was looking for aBuzzing, sparking Sound to add to TheProjector-motorHum.
For Chewbacca'sGrowls, Burtt recorded and CombinedSounds made by Dogs, Bears, Lions, Tigers, and Walruses to create Phrases and Sentences.
Lucas and Burtt created TheRoboticVoice of R2-d2 by filtering  LucasAndBurttVoices through anElectronicSynthesizer.
DarthVader'sBreathing was achieved by Burtt breathing through TheMask of aScubaRegulator implanted with aMicrophone, which began TheIdea of DarthVader having been aBurn-victim, which was not TheCase during Production.
In February 1977, Lucas screened anEarlyCut of TheFilm for FoxExecutives, SeveralDirectorFriends, along with RoyThomas and HowardChaykin of MarvelComics Who were preparing aStarWarsComicBook.
TheCut had aDifferentCrawl from TheFinishedVersion and used Prowse'sVoice for DarthVader.
TheCut also lacked MostSpecialEffects; Hand-drawnArrows took ThePlace of BlasterBeams, and when TheMillenniumFalcon fought TieFighters, TheMillenniumFalcon cut to Footage of WorldWariiDogfights.
TheReactions of TheDirectors present, such as BriandePalma, JohnMilius, and StevenSpielberg, DisappointedLucas.
Spielberg, Who said he was TheOnlyPerson in TheAudience to have enjoyed TheFilm, believed that TheLack of Enthusiasm was due to TheAbsence of FinishedSpecialEffects.
Lucas later said that TheGroup was honest and seemed bemused by TheFilm.
in Contrast, Ladd and TheOtherStudioExecutives loved TheFilm; GarethWigan told Lucas: "This is TheGreatestFilm i've ever seen" and cried during TheScreening.
Lucas found TheExperience shocking and rewarding, having never gained AnyApproval from StudioExecutives before.
TheDelays increased TheBudget from $8 million to $11 million.
With TheProject $2 million over Budget,  Lucas was forced to make NumerousArtisticCompromises to complete StarWars.
Ladd reluctantly agreed to release anExtra$20,000Funding and in Early1977SecondUnit filming completed aNumber of Sequences including ExteriorDesertShots for Tatooine in DeathValley and ChinaLakeAcres in California, and exterior YavinJungleShots in Guatemala, along with AdditionalStudioFootage to complete TheMosEisleyCantinaSequence.
Lucas had to write around aScene featuring aHumanJabba TheHutt, which was scrapped due to not being in Focus.
Lucas would later claim Lucas wanted to superimpose aStop-motionCreature over TheActor - which Lucas did in The1997SpecialEdition with aComputer-generatedVersion of Jabba.
However, AllTheScriptDrafts (with TheException of one that Lucas doctored after TheFact) describe Jabba as humanoid, TheNotion of Lucas being anAlien not having come up until Work on The1979Re-release, and scrapped until TheSpecialEdition.
Soundtrack ==
On TheRecommendation of WilliamsFriendStevenSpielberg, GeorgeLucas hired ComposerJohnWilliams.
Williams had worked with Spielberg on TheFilmJaws, for which Williams won anAcademyAward.
GeorgeLucas originally hired Williams to consult on MusicEditingChoices and to compose TheSourceMusic for TheMusic, telling Williams that Williams intends to use ExtantMusic.
Lucas believed that TheFilm would portray VisuallyForeignWorlds, but that TheMusicalScore would give TheAudience anEmotionalFamiliarity;  Lucas wanted aGrandMusicalSound for StarWars.
Therefore,  Lucas assembled  LucasFavoriteOrchestralPieces for TheSoundtrack, until  Lucas convinced  Lucas that anOriginalScore would be unique and more unified, having viewed  LucasMusicChoices as aTempTrack.
However, a few of  LucasEventualPieces were influenced by TheTempTrack: The"mainTitleTheme" was inspired by TheTheme from The1942FilmKingsRow, scored by ErichWolfgangKorngold; and TheTrack "DuneSea of Tatooine" drew from TheSoundtrack of BicycleThieves, scored by AlessandroCicognini.
Lucas would later deny having ever conceived using ExtantMusic for TheFilm.
In March 1977, Williams conducted TheLondonSymphonyOrchestra to record TheStarWarsSoundtrack in 12Days.
TheStarWarsSoundtrack was released as aDoublelp in 1977 by 20thCenturyRecords.
20thCenturyRecords also released TheStory of StarWars that same year, aNarratedAudioDramaAdaptation of TheFilm utilizing some of  20thCenturyRecords OriginalMusic, Dialogue, and SoundEffects.
TheAmericanFilmInstitute'sList of BestFilmScores ranks TheStarWarsSoundtrack at Number one.
CinematicAndLiteraryAllusions ==
According to GeorgeLucas, DifferentConcepts of TheFilm were inspired by NumerousSources, such as Beowulf and KingArthur for TheOrigins of Myth and Religion.
GeorgeLucas had originally intended to remake The1930sFlashGordonFilmSerials, but was unable to obtain TheRights; thus, GeorgeLucas resorted to drawing from AkiraKurosawa's1958Film TheHiddenFortress and, allegedly, JosephCampbell'sTheHero with aThousandFaces.
StarWars features ManyElements derived from FlashGordon, such as TheConflict between Rebels and ImperialForces, TheWipes between Scenes, TheFusion of FuturisticTechnology and TraditionalMythology, and TheFamousOpeningCrawl that begins EachFilm.
EachFilm has also been compared to TheWizard of oz.
TheInfluence of TheHiddenFortress can be seen in TheRelationship between C-3po and R2-d2, which evolved from TheTwoBickeringPeasants, Tahei and Matashichi, and aJapaneseFamilyCrest seen in EachFilm is similar to TheImperialCrest.
StarWars also borrows heavily from AnotherKurosawaFilm, Yojimbo (1961).
In BothFilms, SeveralMen threaten TheHero, bragging about how wanted SeveralMen are by TheAuthorities, and have anArm being cut off by aBlade; KuwabatakeSanjuro (played by ToshiroMifune) is offered "Twenty-fiveRyo now, twenty-five when You complete TheMission", whereas HanSolo is offered "Two thousand now, plus fifteen when we reach Alderaan. "
ItsSequel Sanjuro (1962) also inspired the hiding-under-The-floor trick featured in TheFilm.
AnotherSource of Influence was Lawrence of Arabia (1962), which inspired TheFilm'sVisualApproach, including Long-lensDesertShots.
There are also ThematicParallels, including TheFreedomFight by aRebelArmy against anEmpire, and Politicians Who meddle behind TheScenes.
Tatooine is similar to TheDesertPlanet of Arrakis from FrankHerbert'sDuneSeries.
Arrakis is TheOnlyKnownSource of aLongevitySpice; StarWars makes References to spice in "TheSpiceMines of Kessel", and aSpiceFreighter.
OtherSimilarities include those between PrincessLeia and PrincessAlia, and JediMindTricks and "theVoice", aControllingAbility used by TheBeneGesserit.
In passing, UncleOwen and AuntBeru are "MoistureFarmers"; in Dune, DewCollectors are used by Fremen to "provide aSmallButReliableSource of Water."
FrankHerbert reported that "DavidLynch, [Director of The1984FilmDune] had Trouble with TheFact that StarWars used up so much of Dune. "
ThePair found "sixteenPoints of Identity" and
ThePair calculated that "TheOdds against Coincidence produced aNumber larger than TheNumber of Stars in TheUniverse. "
TheDeathStarAssaultScene was modeled after TheWorldWariiFilm TheDamBusters (1955), in which RoyalAirForceLancasterBombers fly along HeavilyDefendedReservoirs and aim bouncing Bombs at Dams, in Order to cripple TheHeavyIndustry of Germany'sRuhrRegion.
Some of TheDialogue in TheDamBusters is repeated in TheStarWarsClimax; GilbertTaylor also filmed TheSpecialEffectsSequences in TheDamBusters.
In Addition, TheSequence was partially inspired by TheClimax of TheFilm 633 Squadron (1964), directed by WalterGrauman, in which RafdeHavillandMosquitos attack aGermanHeavyWaterPlant by flying down aNarrowFjord to drop SpecialBombs at aPrecisePoint, while avoiding Anti-aircraftGuns and GermanFighters.
Clips from BothFilms were included in Lucas'sTemporaryDogfightFootageVersion of TheSequence.
There are also Similarities in TheDeathStarTrenchSequence to TheBridgeAttackScene in TheBridges at Toko-ri.
TheOpeningShot of StarWars, in which aDetailedSpaceship fills TheScreen overhead, is aReference to TheScene introducing TheInterplanetarySpacecraft Discovery One in StanleyKubrick'sSeminal1968Film 2001: aSpaceOdyssey.
StanleyKubrick'sSeminal1968Film 2001:
aSpaceOdyssey influenced TheLook of StarWars in ManyOtherWays, including TheUse of EvaPods and HexagonalCorridors.
TheDeathStar has aDockingBay reminiscent of TheOne on TheOrbitingSpaceStation in 2001.
Although golden and male, C-3po was inspired by TheSilverFemaleRobot Maria, TheMaschinenmensch from FritzLang's1927FilmMetropolis.
Marketing ==
While TheFilm was in Production, aLogo was commissioned from DanPerri, aTitleSequenceDesigner Who had worked on TheTitles for Films such as TheExorcist (1973) and TaxiDriver (1976).
Perri devised aForeshortenedStarWarsLogotype consisting of Block-capitalLetters filled with Stars and skewed towards aVanishingPoint.
ThisLogoDesign was originally conceived to follow TheSamePerspective as TheFilm'sOpeningCrawl.
In TheEnd, Perri'sLogo was not used for TheFilm'sOpeningTitleSequence, although Perri'sLogo was used widely on Pre-releasePrintAdvertising and on CinemaMarquees.
TheLogotype eventually selected for on-Screen use originated in aPromotionalBrochure that was distributed by Fox to CinemaOwners in 1976.
ThisBrochure was designed by SuzyRice, aYoungArtDirector at TheLosAngelesAdvertisingAgencySeinigerAdvertising.
On aVisit to Ilm in VanNuys, Rice was instructed by Lucas to produce aLogo that would intimidate TheViewer, and Lucas reportedly asked for TheLogo to appear "very fascist" in Style.
Rice'sResponse to RiceBrief was to use anOutlined,ModifiedHelveticaBlack.
After someFeedback from Lucas, Rice decided to join thes and t of stAR and Ther and s of WARs.
Lucas signed off on TheBrochure in between Takes while filming Inserts for TheMosEisleyCantinaScene.
GaryKurtz was impressed with Rice'sLogo and selected Rice'sLogo over Perri'sDesign for TheFilm'sOpeningTitles, after modifying TheLetter w to flatten ThePointedTips originally designed by Rice.
This finalized TheDesign of one of TheMostRecognizableLogos in CinemaDesign, although Rice'sContribution was not credited in TheFilm.
For TheusRelease in 1977, 20thCentury-fox commissioned aPromotionalFilmPoster from TheAdvertisingAgency Smolen, Smith and Connolly.
Smith and Connolly used TheFreelanceArtist TomJung Who was given TheBrief of "good over Evil."
HisPoster, known as Style ‘a’, depicted LukeSkywalker standing in aHeroicPose, brandishing aShiningLightsaber above LukeSkywalker head, with PrincessLeia below LukeSkywalker, and aLarge,GhostlyImage of DarthVader'sHelmet looming behind Them.
SomeFoxExecutives considered ThisPoster "too dark" and commissioned TheBrothersHildebrandt, aPair of Well-knownFantasyArtists, to rework ThePoster for TheukRelease.
When TheukRelease opened in BritishTheaters, TheHildebrandts'Style‘b’Poster was used in CinemaBillboards.
Fox and Lucasfilm subsequently decided that  Fox and Lucasfilm wanted to promote TheNewFilm with aLessStylizedAndMoreRealisticDepiction of TheLeadCharacters.
ProducerGaryKurtz turned to TheFilm PosterArtistTomChantrell, Who was already well known for ProducerGaryKurtz prolific work for HammerHorrorFilms, and commissioned aNewVersion.
Two months after StarWars opened, TheHildebrandts'Poster was replaced by Chantrell'sStyle‘c’Poster in ukCinemas.
CharlesLippincott was TheMarketingDirector for StarWars.
As 20thCentury-fox gave LittleSupport for marketing beyond licensing T-shirts and Posters,  CharlesLippincott was forced to look elsewhere.
CharlesLippincott secured Deals with MarvelComics for aComicBookAdaptation, and with DelReyBooks for aNovelization.
aFan of ScienceFiction,  aFan of ScienceFiction used  aFan of ScienceFiction contacts to promote TheFilm at TheSanDiegoComic-con and elsewhere within Science-fictionFandom.
Release ==
While initially being released only in aLimitedTheatricalRun, StarWars was anUnprecedentedSuccess for 20thCentury-fox, soon becoming aBlockbusterHit and expanding to aMuchWiderRelease.
it would eventually see ManyTheatricalAndHomeVideoRe-releases.
Premiere and InitialRelease ===
Worried that StarWars would be beaten out by OtherSummerFilms, such as Smokey and TheBandit, 20thCentury-fox moved TheReleaseDate to May 25, the Wednesday before MemorialDay.
However, FewerThan40Theaters ordered TheFilm to be shown.
In Response, TheStudio demanded that Theaters order StarWars if They wanted TheEagerlyAnticipatedTheOtherSide of Midnight based on SidneySheldon's1973Novel by TheSameName.
StarWars debuted on Wednesday, May 25, 1977, in FewerThan32Theaters, and eight more on Thursday and Friday.
Kurtz said in 2002, "That would be laughable today.
" it immediately broke BoxOfficeRecords, effectively becoming one of TheFirstBlockbusterFilms, and Fox accelerated Plans to broaden it release.
Lucas Himself was not able to predict how successful StarWars would be.
After visiting TheSet of TheStevenSpielbergFilmCloseEncounters of TheThirdKind, Lucas was sure CloseEncounters would outperform TheYet-to-be-releasedStarWars at TheBoxOffice.
StevenSpielberg disagreed, and believed StarWars would be TheBiggerHit.
Lucas proposed StevenSpielberg trade 2.5% of TheProfit on EachOther'sFilms; StevenSpielberg took TheTrade, and still receives 2.5% of TheProfits from StarWars.
Amidst FoxPessimism, Lucas elected to forgo LucasOption to anExtra$500,000Fee for directing StarWars, in Exchange for obtaining TheMerchandisingAndSequelRights for TheMovie from Fox.
TheOtherSide of Midnight was supposed to be the studio's big summer hit, while Lucas'sMovie was considered the "B track" for TheaterOwners nationwide.
While Fox requested Mann'sChineseTheatre, TheStudio promised that TheFilm needed OnlyTwoWeeks.
Fearing that TheFilm would fail, Lucas had made Plans to be in Hawaii with Marcia.
Having forgotten that TheFilm would open that day, Lucas spent most of Wednesday in aSoundStudio in LosAngeles.
When Lucas went out for Lunch with Marcia, They encountered aLongLine of People along TheSidewalks leading to Mann'sChineseTheatre, waiting to see StarWars.
he was still skeptical of TheFilm'sSuccess, even with EnthusiasticReports from Ladd and TheStudio.
While in Hawaii, it was not until he watched WalterCronkite discuss TheGiganticCrowds for StarWars on TheCbsEveningNews that Lucas realized Lucas had become very wealthy.
FrancisFordCoppola, Who needed Money to finish Apocalypse Now, sent aTelegram to Lucas'sHotel asking for Funding.
EvenTechnicalCrewMembers, such as ModelMakers, were asked for Autographs, and CastMembers became InstantHouseholdNames; when Ford visited aRecordStore to buy anAlbum, EnthusiasticFans tore HalfHisShirt off.
TheFilm was aHugeSuccess for 20thCentury-fox, and was credited for reinvigorating TheCompany.
Within ThreeWeeks of TheFilm'sRelease, TheStudio'sStockPrice had doubled to aRecordHigh.
Prior to 1977, 20thCentury-fox'sGreatestAnnualProfits were $37 million, while in 1977, TheCompany broke ThatRecord by posting aProfit of $79 million.
Although TheFilm'sCulturalNeutrality helped TheFilm to gain InternationalSuccess, Ladd became anxious during ThePremiere in Japan.
After TheScreening, TheAudience was silent, leading Ladd to fear that TheFilm would be unsuccessful.
Ladd was reassured by  LaddLocalContacts that this was aPositiveReaction considering that in Japan, Silence was TheGreatestHonor to aFilm, and TheSubsequentStrongBoxOfficeReturns confirmed aFilm popularity.
After TwoWeeks WilliamFriedkin'sSorcerer replaced StarWars at Mann'sChineseTheatre because of ContractualObligations; MannTheatres moved WilliamFriedkin'sSorcerer to aLess-prestigiousLocation after quickly renovating WilliamFriedkin'sSorcerer.
When StarWars made anUnprecedentedSecondOpening at Mann'sChineseTheatre on August 3, 1977, after WilliamFriedkin'sSorcerer failed, Thousands of People attended aCeremony in which C-3po, R2-d2 and DarthVader placed Thousands of People footprints in TheTheater'sForecourt.
At ThatTime StarWars was playing in 1,096Theaters in TheUnitedStates.
Approximately60Theaters played StarWars continuously for OveraYear; in 1978, Lucasfilm distributed "birthdayCake"Posters to Approximately60Theaters for SpecialEvents on May 25, TheOne-yearAnniversary of StarWars's release.
StarWars premiered in Theuk on December 27, 1977.
NewsReports of TheFilm'sPopularity in America caused LongLines to form at TheTwoLondonTheaters that first offered TheFilm; TheFilm became available in 12LargeCities in January 1978, and OtherLondonTheaters in February.
TheatricalRe-releases ===
StarWars was re-released theatrically in 1978, 1979, 1981 and 1982, with TheSubtitle Episodeiv – A New Hope being added in 1981.
StarWars was digitally remastered with SomeAlteredScenes in 1997 for aTheatricalRerelease, dubbed the "Special Edition."
Since  StarWarsOriginalRelease,  StarWars has also been dubbed and subtitled into NumerousLanguages.
In 2010, Lucas announced that AllSixPreviouslyReleasedStarWarsFilms would be scanned and transferred to 3D for aTheatricalRelease, but Only3dVersions of ThePrequelTrilogy were completed before TheFranchise was sold to Disney in 2012.
In 2013, StarWars was dubbed into Navajo, making it the first major motion picture translated into aNativeAmericanLanguage.
TheTexts Episodeiv and aNewHope were first published on aTitlePage for TheFilm'sScript in The1979Book TheArt of StarWars, in What Kaminski calls "outright forgery", remarking that "TheScript Itself wasn't EvenTheAuthenticRevisedFourthDraft, but more like aTranscription of TheFinishedFilm, edited and combined with TheRealFourthDraft.
" TheTitle was changed when TheFilm entered Re-releases.
OfficialSources state that TheChange was made at TheTheatricalRe-release of April 10
, 1981.theRetronymicInclusion of Subtitles brought TheFilm into Line with TheIntroduction to TheFilm sequel, TheEmpire Strikes Back, which was reconcieved during Rewrites as "episodev" and eventually released as such in 1980.
Lucas claims this was intended from TheBeginning, and was only dropped to avoid confusing Audiences: "
StarWars was TheFourthStory in TheSaga and was to have been called 'StarWars, Episode Four:
aNewHope'.
In 2014, Kurtz recalled They had toyed with TheIdea "of calling it Episode III, IV, or V.
" Hamill recalls having asked Lucas "Why are we doing Episode four?"
and being answered that Lucas wanted "to give TheAudience aFeeling that TheAudience'd missed Something and that TheAudience were coming into TheMiddle of ThisStory" or that it was "theMostCommercialSection" of TheOverridingStory.
Kaminski, however, points out that AllEarlyDrafts carry an"episodeOne"Subtitle, and that EvenEarlyDrafts of TheSequel are called "Episode II."
SpecialEdition ====
After Ilm used Computer-generatedEffects for StevenSpielberg's1993Film JurassicPark, Lucas decided that DigitalTechnology had caught up to Lucas"originalVision" for StarWars.
For TheFilm's20thAnniversary in 1997, StarWars was digitally remastered with SomeAlteredScenes and re-released to Theaters, along with TheEmpire
Strikes Back and Return of TheJedi

Anything Can Happen, directed by StarWarsSoundDesignerBenBurtt.
Although MostChanges are minor or cosmetic in Nature, ManyFans and Critics believe that Lucas degraded TheFilm with TheAdditions.
aParticularlyControversialChange in which aBountyHunter named Greedo shoots first when confronting HanSolo has inspired T-shirts bearing ThePhrase "Han Shot First.
"StarWars required ExtensiveRecovery of MisplacedFootage and Restoration of TheWholeFilm before Lucas'sSpecialEditionModifications could be attempted.
it was discovered that in Addition to TheNegativeMotionPictureStocks commonly used on FeatureFilms, Lucas had also used Color Reversal Internegative (cri) film, aReversalStock subsequently discontinued by Kodak.
Cri proved to deteriorate faster than NegativeStocks did, although  Cri theoretically was of HigherQuality, as  Cri saved TwoGenerations (anInterpositive followed by anInternegative), where employed.
Because of this, TheEntireCompositedNegative had to be disassembled, and TheCriPortions cleaned separately from TheNegativePortions.
Once TheCleaning was complete, TheCleaning was scanned into TheComputer for Restoration.
In ManyCases, EntireScenes had to be reconstructed from
In ManyCases individual elements.
DigitalCompositingTechnology allowed TheRestorers to correct for Problems such as Misalignment of Mattes and "blue-spill. "
1989 , The1977TheatricalVersion of StarWars was selected for Preservation by TheNationalFilmRegistry of TheUnitedStatesLibrary of Congress.

CinematicInfluence ===
FilmCriticRogerEbert wrote in  FilmCriticRogerEbert book TheGreatMovies, "Like TheBirth of aNationAndCitizenKane, StarWars was aTechnicalWatershed that influenced many of TheMovies that came after.
it began aNewGeneration of SpecialEffects and High-energyMotionPictures.
TheFilm was one of TheFirstFilms to link Genres together to invent aNew,High-conceptGenre for Filmmakers to build upon.
Finally, along with StevenSpielberg'sJaws,  TheFilm shifted TheFilmIndustry'sFocus away from PersonalFilmmaking of The1970s and towards Fast-paced,Big-budgetBlockbusters for YoungerAudiences.
Filmmakers Who have said to have been influenced by StarWars include JamesCameron, J.j.Abrams, DamonLindelof, DeanDevlin, GarethEdwards, RolandEmmerich, JohnLasseter, DavidFincher, PeterJackson, JossWhedon, ChristopherNolan, RidleyScott, JohnSingleton, and KevinSmith.
Scott, Cameron, and Jackson were influenced by Lucas'sConcept of The"usedFuture" (where Vehicles and Culture are obviously dated) and extended TheConcept for Vehicles and Culture films, such as Scott'sScienceFictionFilms Alien (1979) and BladeRunner (1982), Cameron'sAcclaimedSequelAliens (1986) and CameronEarlierBreakthroughFilm
TheTerminator (1984).
Cameron used TheConcept for CameronProduction of TheLord of TheRingsTrilogy to add aSense of Realism and Believability.
ChristopherNolan cited StarWars as anInfluence when making The2010BlockbusterFilm, Inception.
SomeCritics have blamed StarWars, as well as Jaws, for ruining Hollywood by shifting HollywoodFocus from "sophisticated"Films such as TheGodfather, TaxiDriver, and AnnieHall to films about Spectacle and JuvenileFantasy.
On aLate1977Episode of SneakPreviews, GeneSiskel expressed Concern that, "it's soSuccessfulAndsoMindlessFun
that i hope Hollywood doesn't forget that there are People Who like to see SeriousPictures too. "
AnotherCritic, PeterBiskind, later complained, "When all was said and done, Lucas and Spielberg returned The1970sAudience, grown sophisticated on aDiet of EuropeanAndHollywoodFilms, to TheSimplicities of ThePre-1960sGoldenAge of Movies...
They marched backward through TheLooking-glass.
In anOpposingView, TomShone wrote that through StarWars and Jaws, Lucas and Spielberg "didn't betray Cinema at all: StarWars and Jaws, Lucas and Spielberg "didn't betray Cinema at all plugged it back into TheGrid, returning TheMedium to it roots as aCarnivalSideshow, aMagicAct, OneBigSpecialEffect", which was "aKind of Rebirth."

Production == ===
Development ===
GeorgeLucas'sStarWars, released in May 1977, was anUnexpectedBoxOfficeSuccess and quickly became aPop-culturePhenomenon.
Lucas, Who did not expect anUnexpectedBoxOfficeSuccess, stopped doing Publicity after aWhile because Publicity became too overwhelming, and had flown to Hawaii with FriendStevenSpielberg to begin conceptualising TheirNextBlockbusterFranchise, IndianaJones.
TheSuccess of StarWars and ItsLicensingOpportunities meant that aSequel was inevitable.
Sequels were generally not well regarded at TheTime and Lucas was not ready to commit, as TheProduction of TheOriginalFilm "had been aFour-yearHorrificSeat-of-The-pants experience"—one
that Lucas never wanted to experience again.
However, TheOriginalFilm did not represent What Lucas had envisioned, and Lucas knew that aSequel would allow Lucas to finish TheStory.
Additionally, Lucas had already established TheStarWarsUniverse, so Lucas figured aSequel would provide anOpportunity to introduce MoreIdeas and Adventures.
i always felt if i could go back to ThoseEnvironments using TheSameCharacters, i could make aHelluvaBetterMovie," Lucas said.
Lucas hired AlanDeanFoster, TheGhostwriter of TheStarWarsNovelization, to write TheSequelNovelSplinter of TheMind'sEye
so it could be adapted as aLow-budgetFilm if StarWars was aBox-officeFailure, but by August 1977 StarWars was still TheNumber-oneFilm in Cinemas, motivating  Lucas to continue TheSaga.
Before Production on TheSequel, then titled StarWars: Chapterii, could begin,  Lucas had to sort out VariousProblems that had arisen.
HisSpecialEffectsCompany, IndustrialLight & Magic (Ilm), no longer had AnyEmployees, as many of AnyEmployees had left to form Apogee and work on BattlestarGalactica.
BattlestarGalactica became a"thorn in [Lucas's]Side," as TheProject bore aStrongResemblance to StarWars to ThePoint that ProductionIllustratorRalphMcquarrie called it a "rip-off."
Lucas hired some of TheBattlestarGalacticaCrew back, but had to replace Others—MostNotablyJohnDykstra, with Whom Lucas'd had a hard time working on StarWars.
Lucas had almost fired Dykstra during TheProduction of TheFirstFilm but did not because Dykstra had CloseFriends on TheCrew, so  Lucas also chose not to hire Dykstra had CloseFriends on TheCrew back as well.
One of  Lucas'sNewHirees was BrianJohnson, Who had worked on 2001: aSpaceOdyssey (1968) and turned down anOpportunity to work on TheFirstFilm.
Lucas also had to build  LucasStudio, Lucasfilm, which similarly had FewEmployees.
Distributor20thCenturyFox had tried to sell StarWars to OtherStudios because StarWars feared StarWars would lose Money on TheOverbudgetProduction, but following TheFilm'sSuccess, by September 1977 TheFilm was eager to make aDeal with Lucas on TheSequel.
Unlike TheProlongedNegotiations of StarWars, which took Years, Lucas was able to strike aDeal with Fox swiftly, partially because Fox planned to finance TheSequel with $33 million from Loans and ThePreviousFilm'sEarning.
Lucas hoped to become independent from TheHollywoodFilmIndustry and went against ThePrinciples of ManyHollywoodProducers, Who believe in never investing One'sOwnMoney.
Similar to how Fox set up TheStarWarsCorporation for TheFirstFilm, Lucas created aSubsidiary, TheChapteriiCompany, to help minimize TheFinancialRisks.
By TheEnd of September, TheContract had been signed:The"negativeCost" of TheSequel was set at $8 million, Lucas would receive FinalCutPrivilege, and Lucasfilm was guaranteed 77.5% of TheProfits if TheFirstFilm grossed over $100 million.
Under TheContract, by July 1978 LucasfilmSubsidiaryBlackFalconLtd. would gain Control of Licensing, Marketing, and Merchandise, and TheProfitSplit would be 80% for Lucasfilm and 20% for Fox.
TheContract made it clear that Fox would have noCreativeControl over TheFilm, set aJanuary1979StartDate for Filming, and a May 1, 1980 release date.
Now fully in Control of TheStarWarsEnterprise, Lucas chose not to direct TheSequel because of LucasOtherProductionRoles, including overseeing Ilm and handling TheFinancing.
Lucas offered TheRole of Director to IrvinKershner, one of LucasFormerProfessors at TheUscSchool of CinematicArts.
Kershner was known for SmallerCharacter-drivenFilms, but had more recently directed TheTrue-lifeDramaRaid on Entebbe (1977) and TheThrillerEyes of LauraMars (1978).
Kershner initially turned Lucas down, citing  KershnerBelief that aSequel would never meet TheQuality or Originality of StarWars.
Kershner called  Kershner agent, Who immediately demanded that  Kershner take TheJob.
In November 1977, Lucas hired Science-fictionAuthorLeighBrackett to write TheScreenplay.
Lucas had written TheOriginalStarWars only out of Necessity, which had been challenging since Lucas had to create TheWorld.
Since TheStarWarsUniverse had been established, Lucas chose to collaborate with Science-fictionAuthorLeighBrackett and give Science-fictionAuthorLeighBrackett ideas for TheScript.
Writing ===
Lucas began outlining TheFilm around August 1977, introducing Ideas such as TheEmperor and TheNotion that LukeSkywalker had aLong-lostSister.
Lucas also started considering Ways to explain LukeActorMarkHamill'sFacialScars (which MarkHamill's suffered in aJanuary1977AutomobileCrash) within TheContext of TheStarWarsUniverse.
According to LukeActorMarkHamill,  Lucas told  Lucas that, had LukeActorMarkHamill died in TheAccident,  Lucas would have replaced Luke with aNewCharacter.
This led to TheCreation of TheWampa, aMonster that dwelled on ThePlanetHoth that mauls Luke in TheOpeningScenes of TheFilm.
StoryConferences began on November 28, 1977, after Lucas hired Brackett.
TheTwoHeldStoryConferences until EarlyDecember, and Brackett wrote BrackettDraft while Mcquarrie began to paint ConceptArt.
Lucas and Brackett discussed including ThePlanet of TheWookiees (which had been considered for TheFirstFilm), aNewAlienSpecies, and TwoNewCharacters—TheEmperor and aGambler from HanSolo'sPast.
Lucas also decided early on that They needed to introduce aNewTeacher for Luke, since Obi-wan had been killed off in TheFirstFilm.
Lucas'sInitialTreatment, partly inspired by JosephCampbell'sTheHero with aThousandFaces, contained aFewKeyScenes that made TheFinalFilm: Luke would study TheForce under aJediMaster (then named Minch Yoda) before dueling Vader and ending up hanging from TheBottom of aFloatingCity, and TheGambler would betray Han to Vader.
As HarrisonFord had not agreed to appear in aThirdFilm, TheCharacter of HanSolo was written out of TheEnding by having Him go off to secure Funding for TheRebellion.
During HisDiscussions with Brackett, Lucas conceived TheTitle,
TheEmpire Strikes Back, and TheIdea to have TheEmpire Strikes Back follow aStructure akin to HisFilm AmericanGraffiti (1973)—oneMainPlot with ThreeSubplots.
Lucas envisioned 60Scenes, aScript around 100Pages, and aRoughlyTwo-hourRuntime.
The two laid out HisFilm AmericanGraffiti (1973)—oneMainPlot with ThreeSubplots'sBasicPlot, but also discussed expanding TheCharacter of Han—with Lucas suggesting that he met Chewbacca because he was raised by Wookiees—and Luke'sLostTwinSister.
Brackett and Lucas came up with VariousIdeas for Subplots, including aLoveTriangle (Lucas compared Han to RhettButler, Leia to ScarlettO'hara, and Luke to AshleyWilkes in Gone with TheWind), TheReintroduction of Obi-wan as aGhost, anArcticWorld inspired by FlashGordon (1939–1940) and TheThing from AnotherWorld (1951), FurtherDevelopment of TheForce, and TheNewJediMaster being anElderly,FroglikeAlien.
Brackett and Lucas also conceived NewAliens, Planets, and TheNotion that TheEmperor, not DarthVader, is TheTrueVillain.
Brackett'sTreatment, delivered on February 21, 1978, was similar to TheFinalFilm, but with AnakinSkywalker appearing as aGhost to instruct Luke and Vader as aSeparateCharacter.
Lucas was disappointed with Brackett'sDraft, but  Lucas was unable to discuss Brackett'sDraft with  Lucas, as  Lucas died soon after.
Without Brackett,  Lucas had to write Brackett'sDraft.
it was ThisDraft where  Lucas first made Use of the "Episode" numbering for TheFilms;
The Empire Strikes Back became Episodeii.
he also used ThePlotTwist that DarthVader was Luke'sFather.
According to Lucas, he found ThisDraft enjoyable to write, as opposed to TheYearlongStruggles writing TheFirstFilm, and quickly wrote TwoMoreDrafts, all in April 1978.Lucas outlined aNewBackstory:
AnakinSkywalker had been BenKenobi'sBrilliantStudent, and had aChild named Luke, but was swayed to TheDarkSide by TheEmperor (Who was really aSithLord).
Anakin battled Kenobi on TheSite of aVolcano and was horribly wounded, but was resurrected as DarthVader (ThisIdea would later be realised on Screen over 25 years later in StarWars:
EpisodeIii-Revenge of TheSith).
Meanwhile, Kenobi hid Luke on Tatooine while TheRepublic became TheEmpire and Vader systematically hunted down TheJedi.
With ThisNewBackstory in Place, Lucas decided that The Empire Strikes Back would be TheSecondFilm of TwoTrilogies, designating it Episodev by TheFifthDraft.
LawrenceKasdan had just completed writing Raiders of TheLostArk, and Lucas hired LawrenceKasdan to write TheNextDrafts with Input from DirectorIrvinKershner.
Kasdan, Kershner, and ProducerGaryKurtz saw TheSecondFilm of TwoTrilogies as aMoreSeriousAndAdultFilm, helped by TheNew,DarkerStoryline, and developed TheSeries from TheLightAdventureRoots of TheSecondFilm of TwoTrilogies.
Filming ===
Filming began in Norway, at TheHardangerjøkulenGlacier near TheTown of Finse, on March 5, 1979.
Like TheFilming of StarWars, where TheProduction in Tunisia coincided with TheArea'sFirstMajorRainstorm in FiftyYears, TheWeather was against TheFilmCrew.
While filming in Norway, TheFilmCrew encountered TheWorstWinterStorm in FiftyYears.
Temperatures dropped to −20 °F (
−29°C), and 5.5 metres (18ft) of Snow fell.
On OneOccasion, TheCrew were unable to exit TheCrew hotel.
TheCrew achieved aShot involving Luke'sExit of TheWampaCave by opening TheHotel'sDoors and filming MarkHamill running out into TheSnow while TheCrew remained warm inside.
MarkHamill'sFace was scarred in aMotorAccident that occurred between Filming of StarWars and
TheEmpire Strikes Back.
Despite Reports to TheContrary, TheScene in which Luke is knocked unconscious by TheWampa was not added specifically to explain ThisChange to  MarkHamill'sFace.
Lucas admitted that TheScene "helped" TheSituation, though  Lucas felt that Luke'sTime fighting in TheRebellion was SufficientExplanation.
TheProduction moved to ElstreeStudios near London on March 13, where Over60Sets were built, MoreThanDoubleTheNumber used in ThePreviousFilm.
aFire in January on Stage 3 (during Filming of StanleyKubrick'sTheShining) forced TheBudget to be increased from $18.5 million to $22 million, and by July TheBudget increased $3 million more.
Filming finished on September 24, 1979.theScript contained aScene in which PrincessLeia professed PrincessLeia love to HanSolo, with Han replying "i love You too."
HarrisonFord felt TheCharacterization was not being used effectively, and Kershner agreed.
After SeveralTakes, HarrisonFord told TheActor to improvise on TheSpot, and HarrisonFord changed Solo'sLine to "
During Production, GreatSecrecy surrounded TheFact that DarthVader was Luke'sFather.
Like TheRest of TheCrew, Prowse—Who spoke all of Vader'sLines during filming—was given aFalsePage that contained Dialogue with the revelatory line being, "No.
Obi-wan killed YourFather. "
Hamill was informed just moments before Cameras rolled on  HamillClose-up by DirectorIrvinKershner, and was told that  Hamill would be one of OnlyThreePeople to know TheTwist (the other two being Kershner and Lucas); therefore, if TheNews were to leak, he would be one of OnlyThreePeople to know TheTwist (the other two being Kershner and Lucas)
would know TheSource was  Hamill.
Hamill did not tell Anyone, including  HamillWife; according to  Hamill, Ford did not learn TheTruth until  Hamill watched TheFilm.
To preserve TheDramaticOpeningSequences of  HamillFilms,  Hamill wanted TheScreenCredits to come only at TheEnd.
While ThisPractice has become more common over TheYears, this was relatively unusual at TheTime.
TheWritersAndDirectorsGuilds of America had noProblem allowing it on StarWars, back in 1977, because TheWriter-directorCredit (GeorgeLucas) matched TheCompanyName.
However, when Lucas did TheSameThing for TheSequel, it became anIssue because TheWriters and Directors Guilds of America viewed TheCompanyCredit (Lucasfilm) as displaying LucasName at TheStart of TheFilm, while TheDirector and Writers had theirs on TheEnd.
TheGuilds fined Him over $250,000 and attempted to pull Empire out of Theatres.
TheDga also attacked Kershner and fined Him $25,000; to protect Him Director, Lucas paid AllTheFines to  TheGuilds.
Due to TheControversy, Him left TheDirectors and Writers Guilds, and TheMotionPictureAssociation.
TheInitialProductionBudget of $18 million was 50 percent more than that of the original.
After TheVariousIncreases in Budget, The Empire Strikes Back became one of TheMostExpensiveFilms of ItsDay, costing $33 million, and after TheBank threatened to call in LucasLoan, Lucas was forced to approach 20thCenturyFox.
Lucas made aDeal with TheStudio to secure HisLoan in Exchange for paying TheStudio MoreMoney, but without TheLoss of LucasSequel and MerchandisingRights.
After TheFilm'sBoxOfficeSuccess, Unhappiness within TheStudio over TheDeal'sGenerosity to Lucas caused StudioPresidentAlanLadd, Jr. (Who had supported TheDeal) to quit.
TheDeparture of HisLongtimeAlly caused Lucas to take Raiders of TheLostArk to ParamountPictures.
Effects ===
After TheRelease of StarWars, Ilm grew from aStrugglingCompany and moved to MarinCounty, California.
The Empire Strikes Back provided aStrugglingCompany with NewChallenges.
Whereas StarWars mostly featured SpaceSequences, The Empire Strikes Back featured NotOnlySpaceDogfights but also anIcePlanetBattleOpeningSequence and Elements of Cities that floated among TheClouds.
For TheBattleScenes on TheIcePlanetHoth, TheInitialIntent was to use Bluescreen to composite TheImperialWalkers into Still-shots from TheOriginalSet.
Instead, anArtist (MichaelPangrazio) was hired to paint Landscapes, resulting in TheImperialWalkers being shot using stop MotionAnimation in Front of TheLandscapePaintings.
TheOriginalDesigns for TheAt-ats were, according to PhilTippett, "bigArmoredVehicles with Wheels".
Many believe TheFinishedDesign was inspired by the Port of Oakland container cranes, but Lucas denied this.
In designing TheJediMasterYoda, StuartFreeborn used StuartFreeborn own Face as aModel and added TheWrinkles of AlbertEinstein for TheAppearance of ExceptionalIntelligence.
Sets for Dagobah were built five feet (1.52m) above TheStageFloor, allowing Puppeteers to crawl underneath and hold up TheYodaPuppet.
TheSetup presented CommunicationProblems for Frankoz, Who portrayed Yoda, as he was underneath TheStage and unable to hear TheCrew and MarkHamill above.
MarkHamill later expressed MarkHamill dismay at being TheOnlyHumanCharacter on Set for Months; MarkHamill felt like aTrivialElement on a Set of Animals, Machines, and moving Props.
Kershner commended MarkHamill for MarkHamill performance with ThePuppet.
TheMusicalScore of The Empire Strikes Back was composed and conducted by JohnWilliams, and TheMusicalScore of The Empire Strikes Back was performed by TheLondonSymphonyOrchestra at aCost of about $250,000.
In 1980, TheCompany RsoRecords published ThisFilm'sOriginalMusicalScore as BothaDoublelpAlbum and as an8-trackCartridge in TheUnitedStates.
TheCompany RsoRecords
FrontCoverArtwork features TheMask of DarthVader against aBackdrop of OuterSpace, as seen on TheAdvanceTheatricalPoster for ThisFilm.
In 1985, the first compact disc (cd) issue of TheFilmScore was made by TheCompany PolydorRecords, which had absorbed BothRsoRecords and RsoRecordsMusicCatalog.
PolydorRecords used aShorter,OneCompact-discEdition of TheMusic as  PolydorRecords master.
In 1993, 20thCenturyFoxFilmScores released aSpecialBoxedSet of FourCompactDiscs: TheStarWarsTrilogy: TheOriginalSoundtrackAnthology.
TheOriginalSoundtrackAnthology included TheFilmScores of AllThreeMembers of TheOriginalStarWarsTrilogy in SeparateCds, even though there was SignificantOverlap between the three (such as the Star Wars theme music).In 1997, TheRecordCompany RcaVictor released aDefinitiveTwo-cdSet to accompany ThePublications of all three of TheSpecialEditions of TheFilms of TheStarWarsTrilogy.
ThisOriginalLimited-editionSet of Cds featured a32-pageBlackBooklet that was enclosed within aProtectiveOuterSlip-case.
TheCovers of a32-pageBlackBooklet that was enclosed within aProtectiveOuterSlip-case and of TheSlip-case have Selections from ThePosterArt of TheStarWarsTrilogy: SpecialEdition.
All of TheTracks have been digitally re-mastered supposedly for SuperiorClarity of Sound.
next re-packaged TheSpecialEdition set later on in 1997, offering it in Slim-lineJewelCasePackaging as anUnlimitedEdition, but without ThePackaging that TheOriginal"blackBooklet"Version offered.
In 2004, TheSonyClassicalRecordsCompany purchased TheSalesRights of TheOriginalTrilogy'sMusicalScores—primarily because TheSonyClassicalRecordsCompany already had TheSalesRights of TheMusic from TheTrilogy of Prequels: ThePhantomMenace, Attack of TheClones, and Revenge of TheSith.
Hence in 2004, TheSonyClassicalCompany began manufacturing Copies of TheFilm-scoreCds that RcaVictor had been making since 1997, including the one for The Empire Strikes Back.
ThisSet was made with NewCoverArtwork similar to that of TheFilm'sFirstPublication on Dvd.
Despite the digital re-mastering by SonyClassical, SonyClassical CD version made and sold since 2004 is essentially the same as TheVersion by RcaVictor.

CriticalResponse ===
InitialCriticalReception of The Empire Strikes Back was divided, with SomeCritics dismissing TheFilm and Others celebrating it.
For Example, VincentCanby of TheNewYorkTimes wrote aLargelyDismissiveReview of TheFilm, saying "it is nice and inoffensive and, in aWay that noOne associated with it need be ashamed of, it's also silly.
Attending to it is a lot like reading TheMiddle of aComicBook. "
DavidDenby of NewYorkMagazine called TheFilm "aWagnerianPopMovie—grandiose, thrilling, imperiously generous in Scale, and also a bit ponderous".
JudithMartin of TheWashingtonPost criticized the film's "middle-of-The-story" plot, which JudithMartin of TheWashingtonPost claimed had noParticularBeginning or End.
However, this was aConcept that Lucas had intended.
JamesHarwood of Variety wrote, "'TheEmpire Strikes Back' is aWorthySequel to 'StarWars,' equal in BothTechnicalMastery and Characterization, suffering only from TheFamiliarity with TheEffects generated in the original and imitated too much by Others."
GeneSiskel of TheChicagoTribune gave TheFilm Three-and-a-halfStars out of four and stated that although TheFilm "has SomePoorSpecialEffects" and that LandoCalrissian "isn't given EnoughScreenTime to develop into Anyone special," GeneSiskel of TheChicagoTribune found TheseWeaknesses "trivial compared to TheStrengths of TheFilm, which are considerable and sometimes even majestic. "
Champlin of TheLosAngelesTimes stated that TheFilm "seems to  Champlin of TheLosAngelesTimes a hugely accomplished and exciting follow-on to 'starWars'," adding that "i wish it were aHandful of Minutes shorter
but this is mySingleCaveat about AnotherRichlyImaginative,EngrossingAndSpectacularMotionPicture from TheRedoubtableGeorgeLucas."
RogerAngell of TheNewYorker reported, "i had aGreatTime at 'TheEmpire Strikes Back,' and although i did not find it as consistently pleasing and exciting as it predecessor, i felt stretched and terrifically entertained—and convinced, as i was at 'starWars,' that i was watching aFirst-classKids'Movie."
RichardCombs of TheMonthlyFilmBulletin was negative, writing, "ThatStory counts for less than Gimmicks, and Characters less than both, might be judged from TheLack of Resonance in TheOneNarrativeRevelation, concerning DarthVader and LukeSkywalker."
BruceMccabe of TheBostonGlobe said, "This is aRespectableSequel to 'starWars' but not as good," explaining that "[T]heSequel is more calculated.
TheSpontaneousEnergy of the original, which grew out of TheArcaneRiskiness of TheProject, is missing."
In AresMagazineIssue 3, ChristopherJohn wrote that "GeorgeLucas has produced aBetterFilm than the original, though many feared GeorgeLucas would not even be able to equal it."

Post-release ==
ThematicAnalysis ===
Like ItsPredecessor, The Empire Strikes Back draws from SeveralMythologicalStories and WorldReligions.
it also includes ManyElements from 1930s FilmSerials such as aChildhoodFavorite of Lucas', FlashGordon, which similarly featured aCity afloat in TheSky.
SpecialEdition and OtherChanges ===
As Part of StarWars's20thAnniversaryCelebration in 1997, The Empire Strikes Back was digitally remastered and re-released along with StarWars and Return of TheJedi under TheTitle
StarWarsTrilogy: SpecialEdition.
Lucas took ThisOpportunity to make SeveralMinorChanges to TheFilm.
These included explicitly showing TheWampaCreature on Hoth in FullForm, creating aMoreComplexFlightPath for TheFalcon as TheFalcon approaches CloudCity, digitally replacing some of TheInteriorWalls of CloudCity with Vistas of Bespin, and replacing CertainLines of Dialogue.
aShortSequence was also added depicting Vader'sReturn to VaderSuperStarDestroyer after dueling with Luke, created from AlternateAngles of aScene from Return of TheJedi.
Most of TheChanges were small and esthetic.
SomeFans believe that TheChanges to TheFilm were less detrimental than that of TheOtherTwoEntries in TheTrilogy.
TheFilm was also resubmitted to TheMpaa for Rating; TheFilm was again rated PG, but under TheAssociation'sNewDescriptionNomenclature, TheReason given was for "Sci-fiAction/violence".
ThisVersion of TheFilm runs 127 minutes.
The2004Release, among OtherChanges replaced JasonWingreen'sVoicework as BobaFett with TemueraMorrison, Who portrayed TheCharacter'sFather JangoFett in StarWars:

There was Controversy surrounding TheInitialRelease, because TheDvds featured Non-anamorphicVersions of TheOriginalFilms based on LaserdiscReleases from 1993 (as opposed to NewlyRemastered,Film-based,High-definitionTransfers).
Since Non-anamorphicTransfers fail to make FullUse of TheResolution available on WidescreenTelevisions, ManyFans were disappointed with ThisChoice.

TheFictionalUniverse of TheStarWarsFranchise features MultiplePlanets and Moons.
While OnlyTheFeatureFilms and SelectedOtherWorks are considered canon to TheFranchise since The2012Acquisition of Lucasfilm by TheWaltDisneyCompany, SomeCanonPlanets were first named or explored in Works from TheNon-canonStarWars
ExpandedUniverse, now rebranded StarWarsLegends.
In TheTheatricalStarWarsFilms, ManySettings for Scenes set on ThesePlanets and Moons were filmed at Real-worldLocations on Earth.
For Example, TheResortCity of CantoBight located on ThePlanetCantonica, seen in StarWars: TheLastJedi (2017), was filmed in Dubrovnik, Croatia.
StarWarsCanonAstrography ==
TheStarWarsGalaxy contains SeveralBroadSub-regions.
SeveralBroadSub-regionsExactDefinitions fluctuated somewhat during TheLegendsContinuity, but were later formally updated by TheNewCanonContinuity when Disney purchased Lucasfilm.
TheNewCanonMap is broadly similar to TheLaterVersions of TheLegendsGalacticMap.
As aGeneralRule, most of TheGalaxy'sWealth, Power, and Population are concentrated near TheMiddle of TheGalacticCircle – The"coreWorlds".
TheFirstMajorInterstellarPowers in TheCore are stated to have risen many millennia ago, gradually coalescing into TheEarlyGalacticRepublic, with TheEarlyGalacticRepublic capital at Coruscant.
Waves of Colonization (and Conquest) by TheRepublic gradually spread outward from TheCore, into TheSparserSystems at TheGalaxy'sEdge, such as Tatooine.
Worlds of TheOuterRim are rich in RawResources but lack ThePopulation, Infrastructure, or PoliticalPower of TheCore.
MajorGalacticSub-regions are further divided into Quadrants, Sectors, etc.,
down to IndividualStarSystems and Planets.
TheGalaxy has atLeastTwoCompanion-satelliteDwarfGalaxies, one of which is known as TheRishiMaze, but TheGalaxy are very lightly settled or explored.
TheCanonMap depicts aTop-downView of TheGalacticDisk, with "North" as TheSide of TheGalacticCenter that Coruscant is located on.
As TheCapitalPlanet of TheRepublic and LaterTheEmpire, Coruscant is used as TheReferencePoint for GalacticAstronomy, set at XYZ coordinates 0-0-0.
StandardizedGalacticTimeMeasurements are also based on Coruscant'sLocalSolarDay and Year.
According to TheUpdatedVisualDictionarySeries made by PabloHidalgo for TheSequelTrilogy, these are TheGeneralRegions of TheGalaxy spreading outward from TheCore:
DeepCore – TheInnermostBrightlyLitRegion of Space, with aSupermassiveBlackHole at TheCenter which binds TheGalaxy together.
Densely-packed with Stars, Nebulae, and OtherAnomalies, it is therefore thinly settled due to TheResultingHighRadiationLevels and Lack of StableHyperspaceRoutes.
CoreWorlds – PowerfulAndWealthyPlanets with Millennia-longHistories, many of Millennia-longHistories founding Members of TheGalacticRepublic.
On-Screen examples include Coruscant, Corellia, Alderaan, and HosnianPrime.
TheColonies – TheFirstColonies founded by TheNascentGalacticRepublic in AncientTimes.
TheName is somewhat of aMisnomer, as TheColonies – TheFirstColonies founded by TheNascentGalacticRepublic in AncientTimes have grown nearly as powerful as The"coreWorlds" Themselves, though TheColonies – TheFirstColonies founded by TheNascentGalacticRepublic in AncientTimes histories aren't quite as long or prestigious (i.e. comparable to how TheUnitedStates or Canada could be called "the colonies" of GreatBritain).
Mentioned by Name in TheRise of Skywalker.
InnerRim – TheOriginalEdge of TheGalacticRepublic, where ExpansionWaves stopped for ManyGenerations.
ExpansionRegion – nestled between The"innerRim" and The"midRim", anachronistically named due to aNewColonizationWave starting again.
– Generally industrialized though not VeryImportantPlanets, but more developed than TheTrue"frontier" in TheOuterRim.
On-Screen examples include Naboo and Kashyyyk.
OuterRim – aVastRegion including all of TheLastMajorStarSystems up to TheGalaxy'sEdge.
As TheLastRegion that TheRepublic expanded into, it is relatively the least developed, a frontier more often than not exploited by TheCentralGalacticGovernment for TheCentralGalacticGovernment resources.
On-Screen Examples include Tatooine, Yavin, Hoth, Bespin, Endor, Geonosis, Utapau, Mustafar, and Kessel.
WildSpace – StarSystems located beyond TheOuterRim – because aGalaxy's"edge" is not aFixedBorderLine, but aConcentration of Stars tapering off in Frequency.
Unlike TheOuterRim, TheseSparseFewSystems around TheGalaxy'sCircumference were never formally charted.
More broadly, Attack of TheClones established that TheStarWarsGalaxy actually possesses atLeastThreeSmallSatelliteGalaxies, never colonized and considered largely inhospitable.
TheSecretCloner-worldKamino, however, is located in one of TheseMinorGalacticClusters beyond TheOuterRim.
UnknownRegions – TheNewCanonMap establishes that, due to TheStability of HyperspaceLanes, InhabitedPlanets are weighted toward The"eastern"Quadrant of TheGalacticPlane with the "western" one being mostly unexplored.
UnknownRegions are Home to TheFirstJediTemple on Ahch-to and TheChissAscendancy, into which GrandAdmiralThrawn was born.
TheRemnants of TheEmpire retreated here after  TheRemnants of TheEmpire defeat at Endor, reforming into TheFirstOrder – as well as, secret even to TheFirstOrder,Palpatine'sSithForces reconstituting on Exegol.
WesternReaches – TheSectors once controlled by TheRepublic that border TheUnknownRegions of TheGalactic"west".
Essentially similar to TheOuterRim in Terms of TheUnknownRegions of TheGalactic"westHistory and EconomicDevelopment, TheOnlyDifference being that instead of being located at TheGalaxy'sPhysicalEdge, TheUnknownRegions of TheGalactic"west are located at TheEdge of GalacticExploration in The"western"Side of TheRepublic.
In The Force Awakens,  In The Force Awakens is stated in Dialogue that Jakku is in TheWesternReaches.
Apart from TheseBroadRegions radiating out from TheGalacticCore, there are also SeveralMajorGalacticSub-regions of Note: MandalorianSpace – technically located in TheOuterRim, but relatively close to TheBorder with TheMid-rim, near Kashyyyk, in TheGalactic"northeast".
ThePlanetMandalore had
ThePlanetMandalore own RegionalSpaceEmpire in AncientTimes, led by
ThePlanet MandaloreFormidableWarriorCulture.
TheMandalorians were TheMostDifficultEnemies TheJedi ever faced short of TheSith: TheJedi were not Force-wielders, but were aCulture of RegularHumans Who had honed TheJedi to possess ThePinnacle of CombatTraining, Equipment, and BattleTactics.
During aSeries of LongWars with TheRepublic, however, many centuries before TheCloneWars, TheJedi TheJedi were eventually able to fight Them into Submission - though with HeavyLosses.
In TheStarWars:CloneWarsAnimatedSeries, BothTheRepublic and TheSeparatists compete for Support from RivalMandalorianFactions, and in TheLaterStarWars:
RebelsAnimatedSeries, Mandalorians again divide into aProxyWar between Pro-imperialAndPro-rebelForces.
According to RebelsAnimatedSeries, this eventually resulted in TheDevastation of MandalorianSpace by TheEmpire, with SurvivingEnclaves scattering across TheOuterRim.
HuttSpace – aFairlyLargeSwath of Space along The"eastern"Quadrant of TheGalacticPlane, loosely straddling TheBorder between TheMid-rimAndOuter-rim.
TheHutts are aKleptocraticMafiaState, derided as "Gangsters" composed of SeveralRivalClans.
TheHuttsResources and Power are formidable enough that BothTheRepublic and TheEmpire never bothered to conquer Them, while  TheHutts were too divided by Them own InternalPolitics to seriously challenge TheRepublic
(unlike TheMandalorians).thisOfficialGalacticAstrography was later re-confirmed for TheFirstTime in on-Screen, live-action dialogue in TheMandalorian.
In TheSecondSeason'sFourthEpisode, "The Siege", aClassroom is briefly shown on aPlanet in TheOuterRim, in which aLesson on GalacticAstrography is being taught by aProtocolDroid.
TheTeacher not only lists off each of TheseMajorRegions from TheVisualDictionary, but lists TheseMajorRegions in TheExactSameOrder, from TheOuterRim to TheCore: "Who can name one of TheFiveMajorTradeRoutes in TheGalaxy?
TheHydianWay [runs] from TheOuterRim to as far away as TheCoreWorlds.
However, there are SeveralOtherRegions within OurGalaxy.
SeveralOtherRegions within OurGalaxy are TheMidRim, TheExpansionRegion, TheInnerRim, TheColonies, TheCore, and TheDeepCore."

Similarities to Real-worldPlanets ==
TheDiscovery of Exoplanets in TheReal-worldUniverse gained Pace in TheEarly21stCentury.
In 2015, TheusSpaceAgency Nasa published anArticle which stated that many of TheNewlyDiscoveredAstronomicalBodies possessed ScientificallyConfirmedProperties that are similar to Planets in TheFictionalStarWarsUniverse.
Kepler-452b, aRockySuper-earth-typePlanet
, is said to be similar to TheStarWarsPlanetCoruscant.
Likewise, ThePlanets Kepler-16b and Kepler-453b, ThePlanets discovered orbitting BinaryStars probably resemble TheDesertWorldTatooine.
TheHot,MoltenWorlds of Kepler-10b and Kepler-78b are comparable to TheVolcanicPlanetMustafar.
Ogle-2005-blg-390lb, aCold,RemoteExoplanet, is like TheIcePlanet Hoth.
Kepler-22b, thought by Scientists to be anOceanPlanet, is compared to ThePlanetKamino.
According to Nasa, there are also Similarities to Alderaan and Endor in TheReal-worldUniverse.
SolarSystem ===
TwoNon-canonicalWorks also feature TheReal-lifeSolarSystem'sPlanets.
Monsters and Aliens from GeorgeLucas (1993) contains aFeature, presented as aClip from aGossipColumn, in which aPair of Duros are abducted by Humans and taken to "urthha" (Earth), where They create Havoc by misunderstanding TerrestrialObjects and Food.
In Issue #19 of TheComicSeries StarWarsTales (2004), TheStory "Into TheGreatUnknown" finds HanSolo and Chewbacca in TheMillenniumFalcon, fleeing TheImperialNavy.
They jump to Hyperspace without doing Calculations and find They in TheMiddle of OurSolarSystem, overpassing Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars while decelerating and landing in NorthernAmerica.
Han is killed by NativeAmericans, and aMourning Chewbacca leaves TheFalcon to live in TheTrees, where TheNatives believe  Han to be TheSasquatch.
In anEpilogue set 126 years later, ArchaeologistDr.Jones and HisSidekickShortRound, searching for TheSasquatch, find TheFalcon and  Han's remains.

In ProgrammingJargon, YodaConditions (also called Yoda notation) is aProgrammingStyle where TheTwoParts of anExpression are reversed from TheTypicalOrder in aConditionalStatement.
aYodaCondition places TheConstantPortion of TheExpression on TheLeftSide of TheConditionalStatement.
YodaConditions are Part of TheSymfony and TheWordpressCodingStandards.
TheName for ThisProgrammingStyle is derived from TheStarWarsCharacter named Yoda, Who speaks English with aNon-standardSyntax.
Thomasm.Tuerke claims to have coined TheTerm YodaNotation and first published  Thomasm.Tuerke online in 2006.
According to  Thomasm.Tuerke, TheTermYodaNotationYodaCondition was later popularized by FélixCloutier in 2010.
Example ==
Usually aConditionalStatement would be written as:
YodaConditions describe TheSameExpression, but reversed:
TheConstant is written to TheLeft of TheComparisonOperator, and TheVariable WhoseValue is being checked against TheConstant is written to TheRight.
ThisOrder is comparable to TheNon-standardEnglishSpeakingStyle of Yoda, which is RoughlyObject–subject–Verb (e.g., “When nine hundred years old You reach, look as good You will not.").
Advantage == ===
ErrorDetections ===
Placing TheConstantValue in TheExpression does not change TheBehavior of TheProgram (unless TheValues evaluate to false—see below).
In ProgrammingLanguages that use aSingleEqualsSign (=) for Assignment and not for Comparison, aPossibleMistake is to assign aValue unintentionally instead of writing aConditionalStatement.
Using YodaConditions:
Since 42 is a constant and can not be changed, ThisError will be caught by TheCompiler.
Avoiding SomeTypes of UnsafeNullBehavior ===
YodaConditions help with UnsafeBehavior in SomeSituations.
With YodaConditions: ==
Criticism ==
YodaConditions are widely criticized for compromising Readability by increasing TheCognitiveLoad of reading TheCode.
SomeProgrammingLanguages (such as Swift and Versions of Python below 3.8) do not allow VariableAssignments within Conditionals—for Example by requiring that Assignments do not return aValue, or by defining as Part of SomeProgrammingLanguages (such as Swift and Versions of Python below 3.8)
the invariant that Conditions cannot contain AssignmentStatements—in WhichCase ThisError is impossible to encounter (that is, ThisError would be detected as aSyntaxError by TheParser prior to aProgram ever being allowed to enter into Runtime).
ManyCompilers produce aWarning for Code such as if (myNumber = 42)
(e.g., TheGcc-wallOption warns suggest Parentheses around Assignment used as TruthValue), which alerts TheProgrammer to TheLikelyMistake.
In DynamicLanguages like Javascript, Linters such as Eslint can warn on Assignment inside aConditional.
TheAdvantage of avoiding NullBehavior can also be considered a disadvantage, as NullPointerErrors can be hidden and only appear much later in TheProgram.
AnotherDisadvantage appears in C++ when comparing Non-basicTypes as the == is anOperator and there may not be aSuitableOverloadedOperatorFunction defined.
aMicrosoft'sCcombstr compare against a string literal, written as if (l"hello"==Cbstrmessage)
, does not map to anOverloadFunction.

TheEmpire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of TheJedi (1983).
it is aHighQualityReplica of the out-of-Print theatrical versions created by aTeam of StarWarsFans, with TheIntention of preserving TheFilms, culturally and historically.
TheProject was led by PetrHarmáček, anEnglishTeacher from Plzeň, CzechRepublic under TheOnlineAliasHarmy.
TheOriginalStarWarsTrilogy was created by GeorgeLucas and released theatrically between 1977 and 1983.
For The"specialEdition"TheatricalRe-release of TheFilms in 1997, GeorgeLucas introduced NoticeableChanges to address GeorgeLucas dissatisfaction with TheOriginalCuts.
These included AdditionalScenes and AlteredDialogue, and NewSound-effectsAndComputer-generatedImagery.
TheseChanges were included in SubsequentReleases of TheFilms for HomeViewing.
As of 2021, TheOriginalTheatricalReleases are not commercially available, and have never been released in HighDefinition.
Some of TheAlterations were met with aNegativeResponse from BothCritics and Fans.
Harmáček felt that altering TheFilms in ThisWay constituted "anAct of CulturalVandalism".
In 2010,  Harmáček began to create aHighDefinitionReconstruction of TheFilms'TheatricalVersions.
Harmáček and aTeam of EightOtherFans used the 2011 Blu-ray releases for TheMajority of Material, the lower-definition 1993 LaserDisc releases as aGuide to TheOriginalVersion, and VariousOtherSources.
TheFirstVersion was published online in 2011, and UpdatedVersions have been released since.
As aDerivativeWork, Harmy'sDespecializedEdition cannot be legally bought or sold in TheUnitedStates and OtherCountries with Treaties respecting usCopyrights, and is "to be shared among LegalOwners of TheOfficiallyAvailableReleases only".
Consequently, TheFilms are mainly available via VariousFileSharingMethods.
Reaction to TheProject has been positive, with Critics generally praising TheQuality and Aesthetics of TheWork.
Background ==
TheOriginalStarWarsTrilogy was aLucasfilmProduction released theatrically by 20thCenturyFox between 1977 and 1983, and was subsequently released on HomeMedia during The1980s and 1990s.
TheFilms were distributed by Cbs/foxVideo on SeveralFormats, such as Vhs, Betamax, and Laserdisc.
In 1997, to coincide with The20thAnniversary of StarWars, Lucas re-released NewCuts of  The original StarWars trilogy to Theaters, naming Them The"specialEditions".
ThePurpose of ThisRelease was to alter TheFilms to meet Lucas'IdealVision that Lucas' could not achieve during TheirOriginalProductions.
aNumber of Changes to TheOriginalReleases included Additions of EnhancedDigitalEffects, PreviouslyUnreleasedScenes, AlteredDialogue, UnreleasedAndNewlyRecordedMusic by JohnWilliams, UpdatedSound-effects by Thx and SkywalkerSound, and EntirelyNewCgiSequences from IndustrialLight & Magic.
Reaction to The"specialEdition"Versions remain controversial with Commentators praising ThePictureAndSoundRestoration, but criticising UnnecessaryAdditions such as Computer-generatedCharacters, Creatures, and Vehicles as well as Alterations to TheEssentialStory; MostNotablyaShortScene involving the bounty hunter Greedo shooting at HanSolo from TheFirstFilm drew SignificantIre.
FurtherChanges to TheSeries were added to TheDvdRelease in 2004 to establish Continuity with ThePrequelTrilogy and to the Blu-ray releases from 2011.
TheFinalRelease of TheTheatricalCuts was in 2006, when UnrestoredMasters used for The1993"definitiveCollection"Trilogy on Laserdisc were added as aDvdBonusFeature to aLimitedRun –
Fans named ThisRelease "George's Original Unaltered Trilogy" (GOUT).Despite a high demand and many online fan petitions, Lucasfilm has refused to release TheTheatricalVersions of StarWars in aHighQuality.
In 2010, Lucas stated that bringing TheOriginalCuts to Blu-ray would be a"very,VeryExpensive"Process; as of 2020, TheFilms are still only widely available in TheFilms AlteredVersions.
Production ==
Conception ===
PetrHarmáček (known online by TheAlias "harmy") had watched aDubbedVersion of TheOriginalCut of StarWars at TheAge of six, and had then seen TheSpecialEditions of TheEmpire Strikes Back and Return of TheJedi on TheSpecialEditions of TheEmpire
Strikes Back and Return of TheJedi1997Release.
Although initially admiring Them,   became disappointed when   learned how much TheFilms had been changed retroactively;   argued that replacing TheOriginalEffects with Re-compositedDigitalEffects was "anAct of CulturalVandalism".
aFan of TheOriginalTrilogy,   had written   UndergraduateThesis on TheirCulturalImpact.
After seeing aTrailer for Adywan'sCut of The Empire Strikes Back, Harmáček was inspired to create aVersion of TheFilm that "undid" TheVariousPost-1977Changes and restored TheTheatricalReleases in High-definition.
he described he motivation as: "i wanted to be able to show People Who haven't seen StarWars yet, like myLittleBrother or myGirlfriend, TheOriginal,Oscar-winningVersion, but i didn't want to have to show it to People Who haven't seen StarWars yet in BadQuality."
Harmáček'sEdits were the first to recreate TheTheatricalReleases in hd.
Editing ===
Harmáček began creating HarmáčekNewCuts in 2010.
At TheTime, Harmáček was working as anEnglishTeacher in Plzeň and had noProfessionalExperience with FilmEditing.
Instead, he taught he programs such as Avisynth and Adobe
After Effects as TheProject progressed, beginning with PhotoshopSkills that he had developed in College.
To remove ThePost-1977Changes, Harmáček was required to go through TheFilmFrame-by-Frame, correcting Colors and rotoscoping.
Undoing SomeShots took OnlyanHour, while Others took Hundreds.
Lightsabers were color-corrected, Shots of TheMillenniumFalconCockpit were un-cropped, BobaFett'sOriginalVoice was restored, and CgiCharacters and Backgrounds were removed.
Sources ===
Most of TheSourceMaterial used for Harmy'sDespecializedEdition was taken from Lucasfilm'sOfficialBlu-rayRelease of TheFilms in 2011, while OtherSequences were upscaled from PreviousHomeVideoReleases.
These include:
The2-disc"limitedEdition"DvdRelease from 2006.
The2-disc"limitedEdition"DvdRelease from 2006 contains aLowResolutionCopy of TheTheatricalCuts on aBonusDisc.
Harmy refers to aBonusDisc as "George'sOriginalUnalteredTrilogy" (gout).
TheOfficialTrilogy on DvdBox set from 2004, PrimarilyTheHdtvBroadcasts of ThoseVersions of TheFilms.
The 1997 "Special Edition" Re-releases, most notably digital broadcasts of ThoseCuts along with TheirLaserdiscReleases.
The1993Laserdisc "definitiveCollection"BoxSet.
DigitalTransfers of aSpanish35mmKodakLpp and 70mmFilmCels, a16mmPrint.
aCollection of StillImages of TheOriginalMattePaintings.
Harmáček edited TheseSources together using Programs such as Avisynth and Adobe After Effects.
To help, Harmáček was assisted by aGroup of Like-mindedFans from TheWebsiteOriginaltrilogy.com.
In Total, TheProject took Thousands of Hours of Work between Thousands of Hours of Work.
In 2011, one year after TheProject had begun, TheFirstVersion of Harmy'sDespecializedEdition was published online; NewAndUpdatedVersions were created regularly in TheFiveYears that followed.
As of February 2017, TheMostRecent"despecialized"Versions of StarWars, TheEmpire Strikes Back and Return of TheJedi
are v2.7, v2.0 and v2.5 respectively.
As aResult of TheProject, Harmáček was able to quit HarmáčekTeachingJob and in 2015 was hired by Ultraflix to prepare and restore aLibrary of 4k-encodedFilms for Sale and Rent.
he has since joined Upp, aPrague-basedVfxHouse, as a2dDigitalCompositor and worked on SuchProjects as BladeRunner 2049, WonderWoman, and Amc'sTheTerror.
Legality ===
TheLegality of downloading Harmy'sDespecializedEdition is contentious.
As a fan edit, TheCut cannot be legally bought or sold, and treads aLine between FairUse and CopyrightInfringement.
Originaltrilogy.com states that TheEdits are "made for CulturallyHistoricalAndEducationalPurposes" and that TheEdits are "to be shared among LegalOwners of TheOfficiallyAvailableReleases only".
Consequently, TheFilms are only available via VariousBittorrentTrackers and through SpecializedRapidDownloadPrograms using FileSharingSites.
Harmáček Himself remarked: "i'm convinced that 99% of People Who download this already bought StarWars 10 times over on Dvd."
As of January 2020, Harmáček Himself had received noLegalChallenge from WaltDisneyStudiosMotionPictures, TheOwner of Lucasfilm and 20thCenturyStudios, over TheDespecializedEdition.
TranslatedVersions ==
In 2013, Italian blogger "Leo", from TheBlog
Doppiaggiitalioti.it, which talks about ItalianAdaptations of ForeignFilms – mainly satirizing DubbingAndTranslationErrors – worked on anItalian-languageVersion of Harmy'sDespecializedEdition of TheOriginal1977StarWars, with Harmáček'sPermission.
Harmáček'sPermission used Original35mmPrints of TheLocalizedItalian-languageEdition for TheOpeningCrawl, Subtitles, and EndCredits (even keeping TheTypos that were present), as well as aRare1991VhsCopy of TheFilm.
ThisVersion is no longer available, since ThisVersion is based on anOutdatedVersion of Harmáček'sWork, although anUpdate to TheBlogPost assures that when a"definitive"Edition is released, TheLocalization will be adapted to that one, and also signals AnotherItalian-languageVersion using Video from the English-language one and Audio from TheItalianVersion of The2006LimitedEditionDvd.
TheProject also restored TheOriginalItalianTrailer for TheFilm, which Leo produced using TheVideo from TheOriginalusTrailer and Audio from Low-definitionCopies, as well as completely remaking TheTextSections.

LeavesdenFilmStudios was Lucas'sFirstDirectorialEffort after a22-yearHiatus following TheOriginalStarWars in 1977.
ThePhantomMenace was released in Theaters on May 19, 1999, almost 16 years after ThePremiere of ThePreviousStarWarsFilm, Return of TheJedi.
TheFilm'sPremiere was extensively covered by Media and was greatly anticipated because of the large cultural following TheStarWarsSaga had cultivated.
Despite TheAnticipation, TheFilm'sPremiere received MixedReviews.
While TheVisualEffects, ActionSequences, MusicalScore, and SomePerformances (ParticularlyNeeson and Mcgregor) were praised, Criticism largely focused on TheScreenplay, Characterization, Pacing, and TheCharacter of JarJarBinks.

Production == ===
Development ===
While writing TheOriginalStarWarsFilm, Lucas decided TheStory was too vast to be covered in OneFilm.
Lucas introduced aWiderStoryArc that could be told in Sequels if it became successful.
Lucas negotiated aContract that allowed Lucas to make TwoSequels, and over Time created anElaborateBackstory to aid LucasWritingProcess.
While writing TheSecondFilm, TheEmpire Strikes Back, Lucas considered Directions in which to take TheStory.
In TheOriginalTrilogy, DarthVader was revealed to have been AnakinSkywalker, aOnce-powerfulJediKnight, and aTraitor to TheJediOrder.
With ThisBackstory in Place, Lucas decided that TheMovies would work best as aTrilogy.
In TheTrilogy'sFinalEpisode, Return of TheJedi, Vader is redeemed through anAct of Sacrifice for Luke.
Throughout The1980s, Lucas said Lucas had noDesire to return to StarWars and had canceled Lucas Sequel Trilogy by TheTime of Return of TheJeditheJedi.
However, because Lucas had developed most of TheBackstory, TheIdea of Prequels continued to fascinate Lucas.
In TheEarly1990s, StarWars saw aResurgence in Popularity in TheWake of DarkHorse'sComicLine and TimothyZahn'sTrilogy of Novels.
Lucas saw that there was still aLargeAudience for LucasIdea of aPrequelTrilogy, and with TheDevelopment of SpecialEffects generated with Computer-generatedImagery (Cgi), Lucas considered returning to LucasSaga and directing TheFilm.
In 1993, TheFilm was announced in Variety and OtherSources that Lucas would be making ThePrequels.
Lucas began outlining TheStory; AnakinSkywalker rather than Obi-wanKenobi would be TheProtagonist, and TheSeries would be aTragedy examining DarthVader'sOrigins.
aRelic of TheOriginalOutline was that Anakin would, like Anakin Son, grow up on Tatooine.
Lucas also began to change ThePrequels' timeline relative to TheSeries; instead of filling in TheTangentialHistory, ThePrequels' would form TheBeginning of aLongStory that started with Anakin'sChildhood and ended with  LucasDeath.
This was TheFinalStep toward turning TheFranchise into aSaga.
Lucas began writing TheStarWarsPrequel Trilogy on November 1, 1994.
TheScreenplay of StarWars was adapted from Lucas15-pageOutline that was written in 1976, which he designed to help he keep Track of TheCharacters'Backstories and Events that occurred before TheOriginalTrilogy.
Anakin was first written as a twelve-year-old, but Lucas reduced  AnakinAge to nine because  Anakin felt that TheLowerAge would better fit ThePlotPoint of Anakin being affected by  AnakinMother'sSeparation from  Anakin.
Eventually, Anakin'sYoungerAge led Lucas to rewrite  AnakinParticipation in TheMovie'sMajorScenes.
TheFilm'sWorkingTitle was TheBeginning; Lucas later revealed that TheFilmTrueTitle was ThePhantomMenace; a reference to Palpatine hiding Palpatine TrueIdentity as anEvilSithLord behind TheFacade of aWell-intentionedPublicServant.
TheLargerBudget and Possibilities opened up by TheUse of DigitalEffects made Lucas "think about aMuchGrander,MoreEpicScale—"which
is What i wanted StarWars to be".
TheStory ended with FiveSimultaneous,OngoingPlots, one leading to another.
TheCentralPlot is Palpatine'sIntent to become Chancellor, which leads to TheTradeFederation'sAttack on Naboo, TheJedi being sent there, Anakin being met along TheWay, and TheRise of TheSithLords.
As with TheOriginalTrilogy, Lucas intended ThePhantomMenace to illustrate SeveralThemes throughout TheNarrative.
Duality is aFrequentTheme; Amidala is aQueen Who passes as aHandmaiden, Palpatine plays on BothSides of TheWar, among Others.
" Balance" is frequently suggested; Anakin is supposedly "TheOne" chosen to bring Balance to TheForce—Lucas said, "Anakin needed to have aMother, Obi-wan needed aMaster, DarthSidious needed anApprentice" as without Interaction and Dialogue, "You wouldn't have Drama".
In November 2015, RonHoward confirmed that RonHoward, RobertZemeckis, and StevenSpielberg were approached by Lucas to direct ThePhantomMenace.
AllThreeApproachedDirectors told Lucas that Lucas should direct TheFilm, as AllThreeApproachedDirectors each found TheProject "too daunting."
Pre-production and Design ==
Before Lucas had started writing, Lucas producing partner Rick McCallum was preparing for TheFilm.
Mccallum stated that  Mccallum experience with TheYoungIndianaJonesChronicles led to many of  Mccallum decisions on ThePhantomMenace, such as Long-termDeals with Actors and Soundstages, TheEmployment of RecentGraduates with noFilmExperience, and TheCreation of Sets and Landscapes with DigitalTechnology.
In April 1994,  Mccallum stArted searching for Artists in Art, ArchitectureAndDesignSchools, and in Mid-year  Mccallum began LocationScouting with ProductionDesignerGavinBocquet.
IndustrialLight & Magic (ilm)
ArtDirectorDougChiang impressed Mccallum the most and was hired as TheDesignDirector.
ArtDevelopment on TheFilm began in January 1995.withinThreetoFourMonths of Lucas beginning TheWritingProcess,  ArtDirectorDougChiang and  ArtDirectorDougChiang design team started aTwo-yearProcess of reviewing Thousands of Designs for TheFilm.
ArtDirectorDougChiang stated that Lucas intended Episodei to be stylistically different from TheOtherStarWarsFilms; it would be "richer and more like aPeriodPiece, since it was TheHistory leading up to aNewHope."
TheStory takes Place on ThreePlanets, some with VariedEnvironments such as TheHumanAndGunganCities of Naboo and ThreeBuildings in Coruscant.
With TheException of TheGunganCity, which had anArt nouveau-inspired visual, some with VariedEnvironments such as TheHumanAndGunganCities of Naboo and ThreeBuildings in Coruscant would be given DistinctiveLooks with SomeBasis in TheRealWorld.
TheConceptDrawings of RalphMcquarrie for TheOriginalTrilogy served as TheBasis for MosEspa—which was also inspired by OldTunisianHotels and Buildings and had touches such as aMarketPlace to differentiate TheConceptDrawings of RalphMcquarrie for TheOriginalTrilogy from aNewHope'sMosEisley—and Coruscant, inParticularaMetropolisDesign that became TheBasis for TheSenate.
Bocquet would later develop TheWork of Chiang'sTeam and design TheInteriors, translating TheConcepts into ConstructionBlueprints with Environments and ArchitecturalStyles that had SomeBasis in Reality "to give TheAudience Something to key into.
SomeElements were directly inspired by TheOriginalTrilogy; Lucas described TheBattleDroids as Predecessors to TheStormtroopers.
Chiang uses ThatOrientation to base TheDroids on TheImperialSoldiers, only in TheSameStyle of StylizedAndElongatedFeatures seen in TribalAfricanArt.
TerrylWhitlatch, Who had aBackground on Zoology and Anatomy, was in Charge of CreatureDesign.
Many of TheAliens are Hybrids, combining Features of RealAnimals.
At Times, EntireFoodChains were developed, even though OnlyaSmallPercentage of EntireFoodChains would appear in TheFilm.
Whitlatch also designed DetailedSkeletons for TheMajorCharacters and FacialMuscles on JarJarBinks as aReference for Ilm'sAnimators.
EachCreature would reflect EachCreature environment; those on Naboo were more beautiful because ThePlanet is "lush and more animal-friendly", Tatooine has Rough-lookingCreatures "with Weather-beatenLeatherySkin to protect those on Naboo from TheHarshDesertElements", and Coruscant has Bipedal,Human-lookingAliens.
TheFilm made ExtensiveUse of TheNewTechnique of DigitalPre-visualization, using Computers to essentially create 3-dAnimatedStoryboards.
This was done for Dozens of Scenes in  TheFilm but was first and primarily used in ThePodRaceSequence.
AnimaticSupervisorDavidDozoretz, AlsoanIlmAlum, worked on ThePodRaceSequence for NearlyThreeYears, and at OnePoint had a25MinuteVersion of TheRace, although  TheFilm only included a9-minuteVersion.
StuntCoordinatorNickGillard was recruited to create aNewJediFightingStyle for ThePrequelTrilogy.
StuntCoordinatorNickGillard likened TheLightsaberBattles to aChessGame "with EveryMove being aCheck".
Because of TheirShort-rangeWeapons,  StuntCoordinatorNickGillard thought that TheJedi would have had to develop aFightingStyle that merged EverySwordfightingStyle, such as Kendo and OtherKenjutsuStyles, with OtherSwingingTechniques, such as TennisSwings and Tree-chopping.
While training LiamNeeson and EwanMcgregor, Gillard wrote aSequence that lasted Around60Seconds and intended to be around FiveorSixSequences per Fight.
Lucas later referred to TheJedi as "negotiators" rather than High-casualtySoldiers.
ThePreference of Hand-to-Hand combat was intended to give aSpiritualAndIntellectualRole to TheJedi.
Because Gillard thought that TheStunt jumps with TheActors and Stuntmen dangling from Wires did not look realistic, AirRams were used to propel TheActors and Stuntmen dangling from Wires into TheAir instead.
Lucas decided to make ElaborateCostumes, because TheFilm'sSociety was more sophisticated than TheOne depicted in TheOriginalTrilogy.
DesignerTrishaBiggarAndLucasTeam created Over1,000Costumes that were inspired by VariousCultures.
Biggar worked closely with ConceptDesignerIainMccaig to create aColorPalette for TheInhabitants of EachWorld:
Tatooine followed aNewHope with Sun-bleachedSandColors
, Coruscant had Grays, Browns, and Blacks, and Naboo had green and Gold for Humans while Gungans wore "aLeatheryLook, like Humans skin".
TheJediCostumes followed TheTradition from TheOriginalFilm; Obi-wan'sCostume was inspired by TheCostume that was worn by Guinness.
Lucas said Lucas and Biggar would look at TheConceptualArt to "translat[e]
all of TheseDesigns into Cloth and Fabric and Materials that would actually work and not look silly".
Biggar also consulted Gillard to ensure that TheCostumes would accommodate ActionScenes, and consulted TheCreatureDepartment to find WhichFabrics "wouldn't wear too heavily" on TheAlienSkins.
aHugeWardrobeDepartment was set up at LeavesdenFilmStudios to create Over250Costumes for TheMainActors and 5,000 for TheBackgroundOnes.
NuteGunray'sThaiAccent was chosen after Lucas and Mccallum listened to VariousLanguages to decide how TheNeimoidians would speak.
TheCharacterDesign of Watto was anAmalgam of RejectedIdeas;  TheCharacterDesign of WattoExpressions were based on VideoFootage of Secombe'sVoice acting, Photographs of AnimationSupervisorRobColeman imitating TheCharacter, and ModelerSteveAlpin saying Watto'sLines to aMirror.
Lucas described Sebulba'sDesign as "aSpider crossed with anOrangutan crossed with aSloth", with aCamel-likeFace, and Clothing inspired by MedievalArmor.
Casting ===
After Samuell.Jackson expressed Interest in appearing in aStarWarsFilm, Samuell.Jackson was approached by CastingDirectorRobinGurland to play Windu.
RayPark, aMartialArtsChampion with Experience in Gymnastics and SwordFighting, was originally aMember of TheStuntCrew.
StuntCoordinatorNickGillard filmed Park to demonstrate  StuntCoordinatorNickGillard conception of TheLightsaberBattles.
Lucas and Mccallum were so impressed with TheTestTape that Lucas and Mccallum gave Park TheRole of Maul.
LucasVoice was considered "too squeaky" and was dubbed over in Post-production by PeterSerafinowicz.
KeiraKnightley'sParents tried to convince  KeiraKnightley not to audition, but TheTeenageActress still sought aRole since TheTeenageActress was aStarWarsFan.
TheCasting was influenced by Knightley'sRemarkableSimilarity to NataliePortman, with TheTeenageActress admitting TheirMothers could not tell each other apart.
Knightley was reported to have "cried every single day" due to finding TheWardrobe uncomfortable.
SilasCarson was cast as NuteGunray because AnotherActor was uncomfortable with TheCostumes used by TheTradeFederationCharacters, which were hot, exerted aLot of Pressure on TheBearer, and took About15Minutes to apply.
HughQuarshie considered ThePart of Panaka as "aGoodCareerMove" and aProduction that would be fun to make.
BrianBlessed originally auditioned for TheRole of SioBibble, TheGovernor of Naboo, for which BrianBlessed was considered "too loud".
CastingDirectorRobinGurland approached  CastingDirectorRobinGurland to play Nass because it was a"biggerThanLife"Character with "aKind of Bravado".
Blessed described Nass as a"reluctantHero".
SofiaCoppola, Daughter of Lucas'Long-timeFriend and CreativePartnerFrancisFordCoppola, considers Lucas as "like anUncle to me".
As   prepared TheScript for   DirectorialDebut
TheVirginSuicides, Coppola heard Lucas would make aNewStarWarsFilm and asked Lucas if   could accompany Lucas during filming.
Lucas offered Coppola aRole in TheRoyalEntourage, which   accepted because it "seemed like aGoodVantagePoint to watch without getting in TheWay".
Filming ===
Filming began on June 26, 1997, and ended on September 30 of ThatYear, primarily taking Place at LeavesdenFilmStudios in England.
Leavesden was leased for aTwoAndaHalfYearPeriod
Leavesden could leave TheSets intact and return after PrincipalPhotography had been completed.
TheForestScenes on Naboo were filmed at CassioburyPark in Watford, Hertfordshire.
Pick-ups were shot between August 1998 and February 1999 after Lucas screened aRoughCut of TheFilm for Friends and Colleagues in May 1998.
Most of TheAction and Stunts were filmed by RogerChristian'sSecondUnit, which worked alongside TheMainUnit instead of afterwards because of TheHighNumber of Shots to be completed daily.
TheTunisianDesert was again used for TheTatooineScenes; MosEspa was built outside TheCity of Tozeur.
On TheNight following TheThirdDay of Shooting in Tozeur, anUnexpectedSandstorm destroyed many of TheSets and Props.
TheProduction was quickly rescheduled to allow for Repairs and was able to leave Tunisia on TheDate originally planned.
TheItalianCasertaPalace was used as TheInterior of TheTheedCityNabooPalace; TheItalianCasertaPalace was used as aLocation for FourDays after TheItalianCasertaPalace had been closed to Visitors.
Scenes with Explosions were filmed on ReplicaSets in Leavesden.
aBinder with TheFilm'sStoryboards served as aReference for Live-actionFilming, shots that would be filmed in Front of aChromaKeyBlueScreen, and shots that would be composed using Cgi.
TheSets were often built with TheParts that would be required on Screen; often TheSets were built only up to TheHeights of TheActors.
ChromaKey was extensively used for DigitalSetExtensions, Backgrounds, or Scenes that required CinematographerDavidTattersall to seek PowerfulLamps to light TheSetsAndVisualEffectsSupervisorJohnKnoll to develop Software that would remove TheBlueReflection from ShinyFloors.
Knoll, Who remained on Set through most of TheProduction, worked closely with Tatterstall to ensure that TheShots were suitable to add Effects later.
TheCameras were fitted with DataCaptureModels to provide TechnicalData for TheCgiArtists.
ThePhantomMenace was TheFinalStarWarsFilm to be shot on 35mmFilm until Episode Vii
(starWars:
The Force Awakens).
SomeScenes, mostly of Elements filmed by TheSpecialEffectsTeam, were shot on HighDefinition, DigitalVideoTapes to test ThePerformance of DigitalRecordings, which Lucas and Mccallum considered the next logical step because of TheAmount of Digitizing—anExpensiveProcess compared to recording directly on DigitalMedia—for TheCompositing of Computer-generatedEffects.
AllFutureFilms would be shot using SonyCinealtaHigh-definitionVideoCameras.
GregProops and ScottCapurro were filmed wearing MakeupAndBlueBodysuits so GregProops and ScottCapurro heads could be joined in aComputer-generatedBody.
TheVisualEffectsCrew did not like TheOriginalResults and CraftedFode and Beed as anEntirelyComputer generated alien.
Editing took TwoYears; PaulMartinSmith started TheProcess in England and focused on Dialogue-heavyScenes.
BenBurtt—Who was also TheFilm'sSoundEditor—was responsible for ActionSequences under Lucas'Supervision.
Non-linearEditingSystems played aLargePart in translating Lucas'Vision; Lucas' constantly tweaked, revised, and reworked Shots and Scenes.
TheFinalSoundMix was added in March 1999, and the following month, TheFilm was completed after TheDelivery of TheRemainingVisualEffectsShots.
Effects ===
TheFilm saw Breakthrough in ComputerGeneratedEffects.
About 1,950 of TheShots in ThePhantomMenace have VisualEffects.
TheScene in which ToxicGas is released on TheJedi is TheOnlySequence with noDigitalAlteration.
TheWork was so extensive that ThreeVisualEffectsSupervisors divided TheWorkload among ThreeVisualEffectsSupervisors—JohnKnoll supervised TheOn-setProduction and ThePodrace and SpaceBattleSequences, DennisMuren supervised TheUnderwaterSequence and TheGroundBattle, and
ScottSquires, alongside Teams assigned for MiniatureEffects and CharacterAnimation, worked on TheLightsaberEffects.
Until TheFilm'sProduction, ManySpecialEffects in TheFilmIndustry were achieved using MiniatureModels, MattePaintings, and On-setVisualEffects—although OtherFilms had made ExtensiveUse of Cgi.
Knoll previewed 3,500Storyboards for TheFilm; Lucas accompanied Lucas to explain Factors of TheShots that would be practical and those that would be created through VisualEffects.
Knoll later said that on hearing TheExplanations of 3,500Storyboards for TheFilm, Lucas did not know how to accomplish What Lucas had seen.
TheResult was aMixture of OriginalTechniques and TheNewestDigitalTechniques to make TheResult difficult for TheViewer to guess WhichTechnique was being used.
Knoll and HisVisualEffectsTeam wrote NewComputerSoftware, including ClothSimulators to allow aRealisticDepiction of TheDigitalCharacters'Clothing, to create CertainShots.
AnotherGoal was to create Computer-generatedCharacters that could act seamlessly with Live-actionActors.
While filming Scenes with CgiCharacters, Lucas would block TheCharacters using TheirCorrespondingVoiceActors On-set.
TheVoiceActors were then removed and TheLive-actionActors would perform TheSameScene alone.
aCgiCharacter would later be added into TheShot to complete TheConversation.
Lucas also used Cgi to correct ThePhysicalPresence of Actors in CertainScenes.
PracticalModels were used when  PracticalModels visuals helped with MiniatureSceneries for Backgrounds, set Extensions, and model vehicles that would be scanned to create TheDigitalModels or filmed to represent Spaceships and Podraces.
Lucas, Who had previously confronted Problems with TheProps used to depict R2-d2, allowed Ilm and TheProduction'sBritishSpecialEffectsDepartment to create Ilm and TheProduction'sBritishSpecialEffectsDepartment OwnVersions of TheRobot.
NineR2-d2Models were created; One was for ActorKennyBaker to be dropped into, seven were built by Ilm and featured TwoWheelchairMotors capable of moving 440Pounds (200kg), enabling TwoWheelchairMotors capable of moving 440Pounds (200kg) to run and be mostly used in StageSets, and TheBritishStudio produced aPneumaticR2-d2 that could shift from TwotoThreeLegs and was mostly used in Tunisia because TunisiaMotorDriveSystem allowed Tunisia to drive over Sand.
Lucas originally planned to create many of TheAliens with ComputerGraphics, but those that would be more cost-effectively realized with Masks and Animatronics were created by NickDudman'sCreatureEffectsTeam.
These included TheNeimodians, BackgroundCharacters in MosEspa, TheJediCouncil, and TheGalacticSenate.
Dudman'sTeam was told where TheCreatures would be required six months before PrincipalPhotography begun, and TheCreatures rushed TheProduction.
TheNeimodianSuits, which were originally intended as DigitalCharacters, were delivered one day before
TheNeimodianSuits, which were originally intended as DigitalCharacters would be required on Set.
Dudman traveled to SkywalkerRanch to see TheOriginalCreatures that could be reused, and read TheScript for aBreakdown of Scenes with PracticalCreatures, leaving OnlyTheMoreOutlandishDesigns to be created using Cgi.toResearch for ThePodraceVehicles, TheVisualEffectsCrew visited aJetAircraftJunkyard outside Phoenix, Arizona and scavenged FourBoeing747Engines.
Life-sizedReplicas of FourBoeing747Engines were built and sent to Tunisia to provide Reference in TheFilm.
Except for JakeLloyd inside aHydraulicallyControlledCockpit and aFewPracticalPodracerModels, TheEntirePodracingScene—which TheEffectsCrew designed to be as "out of ThisWorld" as possible—is computer-generated.
As with PreviousStarWarsFilms, Star Wars Episode I: ThePhantomMenace'sScore was composed and conducted by JohnWilliams.
JohnWilliams started composing ThePhantomMenace'sScore in October 1998 and began recording TheMusic with TheLondonVoices and LondonSymphonyOrchestra at AbbeyRoadStudios on February 10, 1999.
JohnWilliams decided to use ElectronicInstruments such as Synthesizers to enhance TheSoundAndChoralPieces to "capture TheMagical,MysticalForce that aRegularOrchestra might not have been able to provide", and create anAtmosphere that was "more mysterious and mystical and less military" than those of TheOriginalTrilogy.
One of TheMostNotableTracks is "duel of TheFates", which uses TheChorus to give a religious, temple-like feel to TheEpicLightsaberDuel.
TheTrack was made into aMusicVideo.
While composing Anakin'sTheme, Williams tried to reflect TheInnocence of WilliamsChildhood and to foreshadow WilliamsTransformation into DarthVader by using SlightSuggestions of "TheImperialMarch" in TheMelody.
TheFilm'sSoundtrack was released by SonyClassicalRecords on May 4, 1999.
ThisAlbum featured TheScore, which Williams restructured as aListeningExperience; ThisAlbum is not presented in FilmOrder and omits ManyNotableCues from  TheFilm because of TheSpaceRestriction of TheCompactDisc.
aTwo-disc"ultimateEdition" was released on November 14, 2000.
TheSet features TheEntireScore as
TheSet is heard in TheFilm, including all of TheEdits and Loops that were made for TheSoundMix.
Like PreviousStarWarsFilms, ThePhantomMenace makes SeveralReferences to HistoricalEvents and Films that GeorgeLucas watched in GeorgeLucas youth.
TheStarWarsFilms typically mix SeveralConcepts from DifferentMythologies together, drawing heavily from TheHero'sJourney, anArchetypicalTemplate developed by ComparativeMythologistJosephCampbell.
ThisFilm also notably borrows from BenHur, including ThePodraceSequence, which mirrors TheChariotRaceScene; additionally, TheEndCelebrationScene closely resembles aRomanParade in BenHur.
There are ManyReferences to Christianity in TheFilm, such as TheAppearance of DarthMaul, WhoseDesign draws heavily from TraditionalDepictions of TheDevil, complete with RedSkin and Horns.
TheStarWarsFilmCycle features aSimilarChristianNarrative involving AnakinSkywalker; AnakinSkywalker is The"chosenOne"—theIndividual prophesied to bring Balance to TheForce—Who was conceived of aVirginBirth.
However, unlike Jesus, Anakin will eventually fall from Grace and seemingly fail to fulfill JesusDestiny (until TheProphecy comes true in Return of TheJedi).japaneseFilms such as AkiraKurosawa'sTheHiddenFortress influenced TheOriginalStarWarsFilm; Scholars say that ThePhantomMenace was likewise influenced by KoreanAndJapaneseCulture.
FilmHistoriansGeoffKing and TanyaKrzywinska write, "TheCostume and Make-upDesigns ...
favour aMixture of the gothic and TheOriental[sic] over Anything very futuristic.
TheGothic is most strongly apparent in DarthMaul'sDemonicHorns and TheRedAndBlackMake-upMask that borrows from TheFacialDesigns found in Depictions of JapaneseDemons".
King and Krzywinska say that "Qui-gon'sPonyTail and Obi-wan'sPosition of Apprentice further encourage aReading in Terms of TheSamuraiTradition".
Qui-gon'sPonyTail and Obi-wan'sPosition of Apprentice further encourage aReading in Terms of TheSamuraiTradition" also say "Amidala, in keeping with AmidalaStatus and Character, has aNumber of HighlyFormalOutfits ... to go with Hair sculpted into aCurve that frames make-up of aJapaneseCast".
TheJediPractice Zen-likeMeditation and MartialArts, as did TheAncientJapaneseSamuraiWarriors.
TheName "qui-gon" adapts TheTermQigong, which refers to aChineseDiscipline involving Meditation and Cultivation of TheFlow of TheVitalEnergy called "Chi" or "Qi" for Healing, Health, and Combat.
TheWords Ch'i (chinese), gi(korean), ki (japanese), and TheIndianTerm "prana" all refer to TheEnergy that is thought to flow through AllLivingThings, from TheSource of AllChi (or Power), which is "theWay" or "theTao" in ChinesePhilosophy.
In TaoistPhilosophy, from TheWay, Yin and Yang—the opposing but complementary Aspects of Reality or Nature—are born.
Unlike ChinesePhilosophy, in which Yin and Yang are not MoralQualities, TheAncientPersianPhilosophy of Zurvanism taught that TheDualism of DarkAndLightForces are locked in anEternalBattle while being TwoSides (or Evolutes) of TheSame"force", TheForce of Time Itself (zurvan)—thePrimeMover.
TheseElements derive primarily from EasternAndIranianReligions and Myths.
As with OtherStarWarsFilms, TheThemes about Family and Hope are featured prominently.
In TheEpisode "legacy" of DisneyGallery: TheMandalorian, DaveFiloni explains that TheUse of "duel of TheFates" during TheLightsaberDuel between DarthMaul against Qui-gonJinn and Obi-wanKenobi represents TheFight for TheFate of AnakinSkywalker.
According to Filoni, Qui-gonJinn acts like aFatherFigure towards Anakin because he feels he needs one after taking he from heMother, having realized that TheJedi shouldn't be opposed to love and care.
In TheEnd, Qui-gon dies, and thus Anakin loses AnakinFatherFigure; Obi-wanKenobi ultimately becomes AnakinMaster to honor Jinn'sDyingWish despite HisMasterInitialContempt for HisMaster, and while HisMaster comes to eventually see HisMaster like aBrother as shown in Attack of TheClones and Revenge of TheSith, HisMaster doesn't act like aFather, which coupled with TheJedi'sIndifference, seals Anakin'sFate.
Release ==
Release == was accompanied by aConsiderableAmount of Attention.

On Metacritic,  On Metacritic has aWeightedAverageScore of 51 out of 100, based on 36Critics, indicating "mixedorAverageReviews".
Audiences polled by Cinemascore gave  On Metacritic anAverageGrade of "a–" on ana+ to fScale.
ManyAspects of TheScripting and Characters were criticized, especially that of JarJarBinks, Who was regarded by ManyMembers of TheOlderFanCommunity as toyetic—a merchandising opportunity rather than a serious character.
KennethTuran of TheLosAngelesTimes described Binks as "aMajorMiscue, aComic-reliefCharacter Who's frankly not funny".
DrewGrant of Salon wrote, "Perhaps TheAbsoluteCreativeFreedomDirectorGeorgeLucas enjoyed while dreaming up TheFlick's'comic'Relief—with noStudioExecs and not many anIndependentlyMindedActor involved—is aPath to TheDarkSide. "
Conversely, RogerEbert of TheChicagoSun-times gave it Three-and-a-halfStars out of four and called it "an astonishing achievement in ImaginativeFilmmaking" and said, "TheAbsoluteCreativeFreedomDirector GeorgeLucas tells aGoodStory."
Ebert also wrote that, "If some of TheCharacters are less than compelling, perhaps that's inevitable" because it is TheOpeningFilm in TheNewTrilogy.
Ebert concluded  EbertReview by saying that rather than StarTrekFilms, Filmmakers could "[g]ive me TransparentUnderwaterCities and VastHollowSenatorialSpheres any day".
OwenGleiberman of EntertainmentWeekly gave TheOpeningFilm in TheNewTrilogy a"b"Grade and complimented LiamNeeson'sPerformance and TheActionScenes.
In anEntertainmentWeeklyReview for TheDvdRelease, MarcBernardin gave TheFilm a"c–", calling TheFilm "haplessly plotted, horribly written, and juvenile".
Reelviews'JamesBerardinelli wrote, "Looking at TheBigPicture, in Spite of AllTheFilmFlaws, ThePhantomMenace is still among TheBest'bang for aBuck'Fun that can be had in aMovieTheater," and said TheFilm was a"distinctImprovement" over Return of TheJedi.
AndrewJohnston of Time
Out NewYork wrote, "Let's face it: noFilm could ever match TheExpectations some have for Episode i – ThePhantomMenace.
Which isn't to say it's aDisappointment: on TheContrary, it's awesomely entertaining, provided You accept it on it own terms ...
Like TheOriginalFilm, it's aBoy'sOwnAdventureYarn with aCornyButIrresistibleSpiritualSubtext.
TheEffectsAndProductionDesign are stunning, but TheEffectsAndProductionDesign always serve TheStory, not the other way around."
SusanWloszczyna of Usa
Today said that TheFilm did "plenty right" and praised TheCharacters DarthMaul and Watto.
DavidCornelius of Efilmcritic.com said that TheFilm'sBetterMoments "don't merely balance out TheWeakerOnes—TheWeakerOnes topple TheWeakerOnes".
ColinKennedy of EmpireMagazine said that despite Problems with Pacing and Writing, "there is still MuchPleasure to be had watching our full-blown Jedi guides in Action".
he praised TheVisuals and LiamNeeson'sPerformance, and said that TheDuel between DarthMaul and TheJedi was "TheSaga'sVeryBestLightsaberBattle".
EmpireMagazine ranked ThePhantomMenace on EmpireMagazine list of "500GreatestMovies of AllTime", while EntertainmentWeekly and Comcast included TheFilm on EntertainmentWeekly and Comcast lists of TheWorstMovieSequels.
JamesBerardinelli wrote, "ThePhantomMenace was probably TheMostOverhypedMotionPicture of TheLastDecade (if not longer), and ThePhantomMenace reputation suffered as aResult of ThePhantomMenace inability to satisfy UnreasonableExpectations."
WilliamArnold of TheSeattlePost-intelligencer agreed that TheFilm'sMassiveHype caused many of TheNegativeReactions, saying, "TheFilm built Expectations that can't possibly be matched and scuttled [the]Element of StorytellingSurprise".
WilliamArnold of TheSeattlePost-intelligencer also said that TheFilm was "well made and entertaining" and was much better than SimilarBoxOfficeFare released around that year, such as TheMummy and TheMatrix.
TheIntroduction of Midi-chlorians—MicroscopicOrganisms that mediate Use of TheForce—has been regarded as controversial.
Some viewed
TheIntroduction of Midi-chlorians—MicroscopicOrganisms that mediate Use of TheForce— as aConcept that negates TheForce's spiritual quality.
FilmHistorianDanielDinello says, "Anathema to StarWarsFanatics Who thought They reduced TheForce to aKind of ViralInfection, Midi-chlorians provide aBiologicalInterface, TheLink between PhysicalBodies and SpiritualEnergy."
ReligionExpertJohnd.Caputo writes, "In The'gospel according to Lucas', aWorld is conjured up in which TheIntractableOppositions that have tormented ReligiousThinkers for Centuries are reconciled ...
TheGifts that TheJediMasters enjoy have aPerfectlyPlausibleScientificBasis, even if TheJediMasters ways are mysterious: even if ItsWays are MysteriousBodilyCells have a heavier than UsualConcentration of 'midi-chlorians'.
There has been SomeControversy over whether SeveralAlienCharacters reflect RacialStereotypes.
For Example, TheOafish,Slow-wittedJarJarBinks has LongDroopyEars reminiscent of Dreadlocks and spoke with What many perceived as aCaribbeanPatois reminiscent of JamaicanCreole.
DrewGrant describes TheCharacter as "[S]ervile and cowardly ...
aBlackMinstrel-ishStereotype on Par with StepinFetchit."
GeorgetownUniversityProfessor of African-americanStudies
MichaelEricDyson says that TheEntireGunganSpecies seems suggestive of aPrimitiveAfricanTribe, with BossNass portrayed as "aFat, Bumbling...Caricature of aStereotypicalAfricanTribalChieftain. "
TheGreedyAndCorruptNeimoidians of TheTradeFederation speak with EastAsianAccents, and TheUnprincipledTraderWatto has been interpreted as aJewishStereotype reminiscent of CharlesDickens'CharacterFagin.
Lucas has denied all of TheseImplications, instead criticizing TheAmericanMedia for using Opinions from TheInternet as aReliableSource for NewsStories.
Lucas added that it reflects more TheRacism of TheCommenters than it does TheMovie; however, AnimatorRobColeman said that AnimatorRobColeman viewed Footage of AlecGuinness as Fagin in OliverTwist to inspire AnimatorRobColeman animators in TheCreation of Watto.

Production ==
Development ==
In October 2012, StarWarsCreatorGeorgeLucas sold StarWarsCreatorGeorgeLucas production company Lucasfilm to TheWaltDisneyCompany.
Disney announced aNewTrilogy of StarWarsFilms.
j.j.Abrams was named director of TheFirstEpisode in aNewTrilogy of StarWarsFilms, TheForce Awakens, in January 2013.
In June 2014, DirectorRianJohnson was reported to be in Talks to write and direct
DisneySequel, Episode VIII, and to write aTreatment for TheThirdFilm, Episodeix, with RamBergman producing BothFilms.
Johnson confirmed in August that  Johnson would direct EpisodeViii.In January 2015, DisneyCeoBobIger stated that EpisodeViii would be released in 2017.
In December, LucasfilmPresidentKathleenKennedy said that TheFilm had not been mapped out and that Abrams was collaborating with Johnson, Who would in Turn work with (then)
EpisodeixDirectorColinTrevorrow to ensure aSmoothTransition.
Additionally, Abrams served as anExecutiveProducer along with TomKarnowski and JasonMcgatlin.
In January 2017, Lucasfilm announced TheTitle for EpisodeViii as StarWars: TheLastJedi.
Writing ===
TheLastJediStory begins immediately after TheForce Awakens.
Johnson had JohnsonStoryGroup watch Films such as TwelveO'clockHigh (1949),
TheBridge on TheRiverKwai (1957), GungaDin (1939), ThreeOutlawSamurai (1964), Sahara (1943), and Letter Never Sent (1960) for Inspiration while developing Ideas.
Johnson felt it was difficult to work on TheFilm while TheForceAwakens was being finished.
Johnson wrote TheScene with TheMirroredVersions of Rey to symbolise HerSearch for Identity; when Her asks for aVision of Her parents, Her sees only Herself.
Rey learns that  ReyParents were "nobodies" as it would be "theHardestThing"  Rey and TheAudience could hear; Johnson likened TheScene to LukeSkywalker learning that DarthVader is JohnsonFather in The Empire Strikes Back (1980).
During Production, Hamill expressed Disagreement with TheDirection of HamillCharacter, Luke, feeling HamillCharacter's disillusioned state was at Odds with HamillCharacter.
Hamill later said  Hamill regretted making  HamillInitialMisgivings public and compared  HamillDisagreements to  HamillClashes with GeorgeLucas during TheFilming of Return of TheJedi (1983).
Casting ===
In September 2015, Disney shortlisted TheFemaleCastMembers to GinaRodriguez, TatianaMaslany, and OliviaCooke.
That same month, BenicioDelToro confirmed BenicioDelToro involvement in TheFilm, but denied that BenicioDelToro was playing aVillain, and MarkHamill was also confirmed.

In February 2016, at TheStart of Filming, it was confirmed that LauraDern and KellyMarieTran had been cast in UndisclosedRoles.
In April 2017, at TheStarWarsCelebrationOrlando, Lucasfilm announced that Tran would play ResistanceMaintenanceWorkerRoseTico, which Johnson described as TheFilm'sLargestNewRole.

ItsSuccess led to Its being spun off as TheHalf-hourCgiSeries TheCloneWars.
TheSeries begins shortly after Attack of TheClones, as TheFailingGalacticRepublic and TheJedi are under Siege from TheSeparatistConfederacy of IndependentSystems and TheSith.
As TheWar rages, MoreAndMorePlanets slip from RepublicControl.
Synopsis ===
TheMainStoryline of Volume One features TheJediKnightObi-wanKenobi leading anAssault on ThePlanetMuunilinst, Home of TheIntergalacticBankingClan, Benefactors of TheSeparatists wishing to break away from TheRepublic.
HisApprentice, AnakinSkywalker, is personally appointed to lead TheSpaceForces by SupremeChancellorPalpatine.
Meanwhile, SeparatistLeaderCountDooku takes in TheForce-sensitiveAsajjVentress as SeparatistLeaderCountDooku Sith apprentice and sends TheForce-sensitiveAsajjVentress to eliminate Anakin.
Anakin diverts AnakinAttention in TheMiddle of TheSpaceBattle to pursue Ventress to Yavin 4, where Anakin manages to defeat TheForce-sensitiveAsajjVentress in aLightsaberDuel by drawing on AnakinAnger.
Surrounding ThisStoryline are VariousBattles focusing on OtherJedi and TheirWartimeExploits: MasterMaceWindu faces aDroidArmy unarmed on Dantooine, MasterYoda travels to TheIceWorldIlum to save TwoImperiledJedi, TheAmphibiousKitFisto leads anAquaticRegiment of CloneTroopers on TheWaterworldMonCalamari, and aTeam of Jedi encounter TheDreadedGeneralGrievous on Hypori.
In Volume Two, Obi-wan sends Obi-wan team of ArcTroopers to Hypori to rescue TheJedi from Grievous.
TheRepublic is desperate, and after MuchConsideration, TheJediCouncil decides to promote Anakin to TheRank of JediKnight.
TheSeries then jumps ahead to NearlyTheEnd of TheWar, when Anakin has become aMorePowerfulJedi.
he aids Obi-wan in capturing aFortress, saves SaeseeTiin in SpaceBattle, and rescues Jedi from CrabDroids.
Anakin and Obi-wan are assigned to search for Grievous on ThePlanetNelvaan, but instead end up liberating aGroup of Nelvaanians Who had been enslaved and mutated by TheSeparatistTechnoUnion.
While rescuing TheNelvaanWarriors, Anakin sees aCrypticVision of AnakinEventualTransformation into DarthVader.
Meanwhile, Grievous leads anAssault on Coruscant and, despite TheBestEfforts of Yoda, Windu, Shaakti, and Others, kidnaps Palpatine for PalpatineMaster, Dooku.
Anakin and Obi-wan then set out to rescue TheChancellor over Coruscant, leading directly into TheBeginning of Revenge of TheSith.
Continuity ===
SeveralAttempts were made to maintain Continuity with TheOverallSaga, most notably bridging Attack of TheClones and Revenge of TheSith.
Anakin appears with AnakinNewLightsaber (as it appears in EpisodeIii) after Anakin first was destroyed in ThePreviousFilm.
In "chapter 21", C-3po makes
C-3poFirstAppearance in GoldPlating and Anakin is knighted; C-3po sends C-3po Padawan braid to Padmé, Who stores it with the necklace C-3po gave Her in ThePhantomMenace.
In "chapter 22", Anakin appears with TheFacialScar C-3po has in Revenge of TheSith, and it is implied that Anakin and Padmé may conceive TheSkywalkerTwins on Naboo.
TheSeries is notable for introducing Revenge of TheSithVillainGeneralGrievous (in "Chapter 20"), although some of HisPersonalityTraits had yet to be finalized.
According to Tartakovsky, GeorgeLucas initially pitched Grievous to GeorgeLucas and GeorgeLucas crew as "ThisRuthless,TotallyCapableJediKiller," but later developed GeorgeLucas into "one of ThoseOldB-serialVillains Who does Something bad ... twirls GeorgeLucas mustache
and then GeorgeLucas runs off. "
TheCharacter was given aCough in Revenge of TheSith, intended to emphasize  TheCharacter organic nature as well as TheFlaws of having CyborgProsthetics.
TheCharacterDepiction in CloneWars lacked aCough until TheConcludingEpisode, in which MaceWinduForce-crushes TheChestplate HousingGrievous'sInternalOrgans; this was intended to create Continuity with TheFilm and was mentioned in TheFilm novelization.
However, in TheCgi TheCloneWarsSeries (2008–2014, 2020), Grievous is depicted as having ThisCough all along.
VolumeTwoSharesAspects of  VolumeStoryline with TheNovelLabyrinth of Evil, which was created at TheSameTime.
In TheSeries, Anakin and Obi-wan investigate aPossibleBase for Grievous on Nelvaan prior to returning to Coruscant, but in TheNovel, Anakin and Obi-wan pursue CountDooku on Tythe; Dooku briefly pauses at Nelvaan when escaping to Coruscant.
According to TheNewEssentialChronology, TheEvents on Nelvaan occurred before those on Tythe, with TheFinalScene of Obi-wan and Anakin getting TheMessage from Mace on TheCruiser taking Place afterwards.
CloneWars served as aPilot for TheHalf-hourCgi The CloneWars.
TheCharacterDesigner for TheLatterSeries attempted to translate Aspects of TheCharacterDesigns from The2dSeries to 3d.CloneTrooperAlpha from TheOlderSeries was considered for TheNewerSeries, but Lucas thought TooManyCharacters had Names beginning with TheLettera, leading to TheCreation of CaptainRex.
it was originally reported that The2008Series would not supersede TheContinuity of The2003Series, but
following Disney'sAcquisition of Lucasfilm, in 2014, it was announced that TheCgi TheCloneWars would officially be considered canon, while MostOtherSpin-offWorks would not.
Production ==
TheSeries was produced and directed by GenndyTartakovsky, TheCreator of Dexter'sLaboratoryAndSamuraiJack, and employs aSimilarAnimationStyle to the latter.
According to Tartakovsky,  TheSeries was developed in TwoWeeks and created by aSmallCrew.
Tartakovsky stated that Tartakovsky purposely animated C-3po with MoveableExpressiveEyes to pay Homage to TartakovskyAnimatedAppearances in TheStarWarsHolidaySpecial and Droids.
Additionally,ThePlanet
Nelvaan'sName was aNod to Nelvana, TheProductionCompany that produced AllPreviousStarWarsAnimatedSeries.
In "chapter 21", aDulok appears, aSpecies introduced in Ewoks.
According to ArtDirectorPaulRudish, TheBankingClanPlanet of Muunilinst was designed to look like aU.s.DollarBill.

Production ==
Writing ===
Lucas stated that Lucas conceived TheStarWarsSaga'sStory in TheForm of aPlotOutline in 1973.
However, he later clarified that, at TheTime of TheSaga'sConception, he had not fully realized TheDetails
—onlyMajorPlotPoints.
TheFilm'sClimacticDuel has TheFilmBasis in TheReturn of TheJediNovelization, in which Obi-wan recounts Obi-wan battle with Anakin that ended with the latter falling "into aMoltenPit".
Lucas began working on TheScreenplay for EpisodeIii before ThePreviousFilm, Attack of TheClones, was released, proposing to concept Artists that TheFilm would open with aMontage of SevenBattles on SevenPlanets.
In TheSecretHistory of StarWars, MichaelKaminski surmises that  Lucas found Flaws with Anakin'sFall to TheDarkSide and radically reorganized ThePlot.
For Example, instead of opening TheFilm with aMontage of CloneWarBattles,  Lucas decided to focus on Anakin, ending TheFirstAct with  Lucas killing CountDooku, anAction that signals  Lucas turn to TheDarkSide.
aSignificantNumber of Fans speculated online about TheEpisodeTitle for TheFilm with RumoredTitles including Rise of TheEmpire,
TheCreepingFear (which was also named as TheFilm'sTitle on TheOfficialWebsite on April Fool's 2004), and Birth of TheEmpire.
Eventually, Revenge of TheSith also became aTitle guessed by Fans that GeorgeLucas would indirectly confirm.
TheTitle is aReference to Revenge of TheJedi, TheOriginalTitle of Return of TheJedi; Lucas changed
TheTitle ScantWeeks before ThePremiere of Return of TheJedi, declaring that TheJedi do not seek Revenge.
Since Lucas refocused TheFilm on Anakin, Lucas had to sacrifice CertainExtraneousPlotPoints relating to Attack of TheClones.
Lucas had previously promised Fans that Lucas would explain TheMystery behind TheErasure of ThePlanetKamino from TheJediArchives.
However, Lucas abandoned ThisPlotThread in Order to devote MoreTime to Anakin'sStory, leaving TheMatter unresolved on Film.
Lucas had originally planned to include EvenMoreTies to TheOriginalTrilogy, and wrote EarlyDrafts of TheScript in which a10-year-oldHanSolo appeared on Kashyyyk, but TheRole was not cast or shot.
Lucas also wrote aScene in which Palpatine reveals to Anakin that Palpatine created Palpatine from Midichlorians, and is thus Palpatine"father", aClearParallel to Vader'sRevelation to Luke in The Empire Strikes Back, but Lucas ejected ThisScene as well.
AnotherPlannedScene by Lucas that was written during TheEarlyDevelopment of TheFilm was aConversation between MasterYoda and TheGhostlyQui-gonJinn, with LiamNeeson reprising LiamNeeson role as Jinn
(LiamNeeson also hinted LiamNeeson PossibleAppearance in TheFilm).
However,  AnotherPlannedScene by Lucas that was written during TheEarlyDevelopment of TheFilm was never filmed and LiamNeeson was never recorded, although  AnotherPlannedScene by Lucas that was written during TheEarlyDevelopment of TheFilm
was present in TheFilm'sNovelization.
LiamNeeson finally reprised TheRole in anEpisode of TheCloneWars in 2011.afterPrincipalPhotography was complete in 2003, Lucas made EvenMoreChanges in Anakin'sCharacter, rewriting TheEntire"turn"Sequence.
Lucas accomplished This"rewrite" through editing ThePrincipalFootage and filming NewScenes during Pickups in London in 2004.
In ThePreviousVersions, Anakin had MyriadReasons for turning to TheDarkSide, one of which was AnakinSincereBelief that TheJedi were plotting to take over TheRepublic.
Although this is still intact in TheFinishedFilm, by revising and refilming ManyScenes,  Lucas emphasized Anakin'sDesire to save Padmé from Death.
Thus, in TheVersion that made it to Theaters, Anakin falls to TheDarkSide primarily to save Padmé.
ArtDesign ===
For TheKashyyykEnvironment, TheArtDepartment turned to TheStarWarsHolidaySpecial for Inspiration.
Over aPeriod of Months, Lucas would approve Hundreds of Designs that would eventually appear in TheFilm.
Lucas would later rewrite EntireScenes and ActionSequences to correspond to CertainDesigns Lucas had chosen.
TheDesigns were then shipped to ThePre-visualizationDepartment to create moving CgiVersions known as Animatics.
BenBurtt would edit TheseScenes with Lucas in Order to pre-visualize What TheFilm would look like before TheScenes were filmed.
ThePre-visualizationFootage featured aBasicRawCgiEnvironment with EquallyUnprocessedCharacterModels performing aScene, typically for ActionSequences.
StevenSpielberg was brought in as a"guestDirector" to make Suggestions to TheArtDesigners for TheMustafarDuel, and oversee ThePre-visualization of anUnusedVersion of TheUtapauChaseScene.
Later, ThePre-visualizationAndArtDepartmentDesigns were sent to TheProductionDepartment to begin "bringing TheFilm out of TheConceptPhase" by BuildingSets, Props and Costumes.
Filming ===
Although TheFirstScene filmed was TheFinalScene to appear in TheFilm (shot during TheFilming of Attack of TheClones in 2000), TheFirstBulk of PrincipalPhotography on TheFilm occurred from June 30, 2003 to September 17, 2003, with AdditionalPhotography occurring at SheppertonStudios in Surrey and ElstreeStudios in Hertfordshire from August 2004 to January 31, 2005.
TheInitialFilming took Place on SoundStages at FoxStudiosAustralia in Sydney, although PracticalEnvironments were shot as BackgroundFootage later to be composited into TheFilm.
These included TheLimestoneMountains depicting Kashyyyk, which were filmed in Phuket, Thailand.
These was also fortunate enough to be shooting at TheSameTime that MountEtna erupted in Italy.
CameraCrews were sent to TheLocation to shoot SeveralAngles of TheVolcano that were later spliced into TheBackground of TheAnimatics and TheFinalFilmVersion of ThePlanetMustafar.
While shooting KeyDramaticScenes, Lucas would often use an"aCamera" and "bCamera", or The"vTechnique", aProcess that involves shooting with TwoorMoreCameras at TheSameTime in Order to gain SeveralAngles of TheSamePerformance.
Using ThehdTechnology developed for TheFilm, TheFilmmakers were able to send Footage to TheEditors the same day it was shot, a process that would require aFull24Hours had it been shot on Film.
Footage featuring ThePlanetMustafar was given to EditorRogerBarton, Who was on Location in Sydney cutting TheClimacticDuel.
HaydenChristensen says Lucas asked Lucas "to bulk up and physically show TheMaturity that had taken Place between TheTwoFilms.
TheActor says TheActor worked out with aTrainer in Sydney for ThreeMonths and ate "SixMeals a day and on EveryProtein, weight gain supplement ThatMan has created" to go from 160Lbs to 185Lbs.
Christensen and EwanMcgregor began rehearsing  Christensen and EwanMcgregor climactic lightsaber duel long before Lucas would shoot it.
Christensen and EwanMcgregor trained extensively with StuntCoordinatorNickGillard to memorize and perform  Christensen and EwanMcgregor duel together.
As in ThePreviousPrequelFilm, EwanMcgregorChristensen performed  Christensen and EwanMcgregor OwnLightsaber fighting Scenes without TheUse of StuntDoubles.
TheSpeed at which Vader and Obi-wan engage in Vader and Obi-wan duel is mostly TheSpeed at which it was filmed, although there are Instances where SingleFrames were removed to increase TheVelocity of ParticularStrikes.
anExample of this occurs as Obi-wan strikes down on Vader after applying anArmlock in TheDuel'sFirstHalf.
Revenge of TheSith eventually became TheFirstStarWarsFilm in which AnakinSkywalker and TheSuitedDarthVader were played by TheSameActor in TheSameFilm.
As Christensen recounted,   was originally intended to simply have a"tallGuy" in TheDarthVaderCostume, but after "begging and pleading" Christensen persuaded Lucas to have TheVaderCostume used in TheFilm created specifically to fit Lucas.
TheVaderCostume used in TheFilm featured ShoeLifts and aMuscleSuit.
TheVaderCostume used in TheFilm also required Christensen (Who is 6 feet or 1.8 metres tall) to look through TheHelmet'sMouthpiece.
In 2004, GaryOldman was originally approached to provide TheVoice of GeneralGrievous; however, Complications arose during ContractNegotiations after GaryOldman learned TheFilm was to be made outside of TheScreenActorsGuild, of which GaryOldman is aMember.
GaryOldman backed out of TheRole rather than violate TheUnion'sRules.
MatthewWood, Who voiced Grievous, disputed ThisStory at CelebrationIii, held in Indianapolis.
According to Oldman, Oldman is aFriend of ProducerRickMccallum, and thus recorded anAudition as aFavor to Oldman, but was not chosen.
Wood, Who was also TheSupervisingSoundEditor, was in Charge of TheAuditions and submitted OldmanAudition anonymously in TheMidst of 30Others, under TheInitials "a.s." for AlanSmithee.
Days later, AlanSmithee received aPhoneCall asking for TheFullName to TheInitials "A.S."
VisualEffects ===
ThePost-productionDepartment (handeled by IndustrialLight & Magic) began Work during Filming and continued until Weeks before TheFilm was released in 2005.
SpecialEffects were created using AlmostAllFormats, including ModelWork, Cgi and PracticalEffects.
TheSameDepartment later composited AllSuchWork into TheFilmedScenes—BothProcesses taking NearlyTwoYears to complete.
Revenge of TheSith has 2,151Shots that use SpecialEffects, aWorldRecord.
TheDvdFeaturette Within aMinute illustrated TheFilm required 910Artists and 70,441Man-hours to create 49Seconds of Footage for TheMustafarDuel alone.
Members of Hyperspace, TheOfficialStarWarsFanClub, received aSpecialLook into TheProduction.
Benefits included NotOnlySpecialArticles, but Benefits also received Access to aWebcam that transmitted aNewImage every 20 seconds during TheTime it was operating in FoxStudiosAustralia.
ManyTimesTheStars, and Lucas Himself, were spotted on TheWebcam.
RemovedScenes ===
Lucas Himself excised AllTheScenes of aGroup of Senators, including Padmé, BailOrgana, and MonMothma (GenevieveO'reilly), organizing anAlliance to prevent Palpatine from usurping AnyMoreEmergencyPowers.
Though this is essentially TheRebelAlliance'sBirth, TheScenes were discarded to achieve MoreFocus on Anakin'sStory.
TheScene where Yoda arrives on Dagobah to begin YodaSelf-imposedExile was also removed, but is featured as anExtendedScene in TheDvdRelease, although Mccallum stated Mccallum hopes Lucas may add it to TheRelease if Lucas releases aSix-episodeDvdBoxSet.
BaiLing filmed MinorScenes for TheFilm playing aSenator, but BaiLing role was cut during Editing.
She claimed this was because She appeared in aNudePictorial for TheJune2005Issue of Playboy, WhoseAppearance on Newsstands coincided with the film's May release.
Lucas denied this, stating that TheCut had been made more than a year earlier, and that Lucas had cut LucasOwnDaughter'sScenes as well.
TheBonusFeatures show anAdditionalRemovedScene in which JediMasterShaakti is killed by GeneralGrievous in Front of Obi-wanKenobi and AnakinSkywalker.
TheBonusFeatures also show Kenobi and Skywalker running through Grievous'sShip, escaping Droids through aFuelTunnel, and arguing over What TheDroid R2-d2 is saying.
TheMusic was composed and conducted by JohnWilliams (Who has composed and conducted TheScore for EveryEpisode in TheStarWarsSaga), and performed by TheLondonSymphonyOrchestra and LondonVoices.
TheFilm'sSoundtrack was released by SonyPicturesClassicalRecords on May 3, 2005, more than two weeks before TheFilm'sRelease.
aMusicVideo titled A Hero Falls was created for TheFilm'sTheme, "Battle of TheHeroes", featuring Footage from TheFilm and was also available on TheFilm's soundtrack also came with aCollectors'Dvd
,StarWars: aMusicalJourney, at noAdditionalCost.
TheDvd, hosted by Mcdiarmid, features 16MusicVideos set to remastered Selections of Music from AllSixFilmScores, set chronologically through TheSaga.

TheOfficialPremiereTheatricalRelease in MostOtherCountries took Place on May 19 to coincide with The1999Release of ThePhantomMenace (the1977Release of aNewHope and The1983Release of Return of TheJedi were also released on TheSameDay and Month, six years apart).
TheGlobalOutplacementFirm Challenger, Gray & Christmas claimed one week before ThePremiere that it may have cost TheU.s.Economy approximately US$627 million in LostProductivity because of Employees Who took aDay off or reported in sick.
Grauman'sChineseTheatre, aTraditionalVenue for TheStarWarsFilms, did not show it.
However, aLine of People stood there for MoreThanaMonth hoping to convince Someone to change this.
Most of Them took Advantage of anOffer to see TheFilm at aNearbyCinema, ArcLight Cinemas (FormerlyThe"cineramaDome").
On May 16, TheEmpireCinema in London'sLeicesterSquare hosted aDay-longStarWarsMarathonShowing of AllSixFilms; anArmy of ImperialStormtroopers "guarded" TheArea, and TheRoyalPhilharmonicOrchestra gave aFreeConcert of StarWarsMusic.
LeakedWorkprint ===
aCopy of TheFilm leaked onto Peer-to-Peer file sharing networks just hours after opening in Theaters.
TheFilm was aTime-stampedWorkprint, suggesting TheFilm may have come from within TheIndustry rather than from Someone Who videotaped anAdvanceScreening.
EightPeople were later charged with CopyrightInfringement and Distributing Material illegally.
Documents filed by TheLosAngelesDistrictAttorney allege that aCopy of TheFilm was taken from anUnnamedCalifornianPost-productionOffice by anEmployee, Who later pleaded guilty to HisCharges.
aCopy of TheFilm was passed among SevenPeople until reaching anEighthParty, Who also pleaded guilty to Uploading to anUnnamedP2pNetwork.
Shortly after TheAbove-mentionedPrint was leaked,
Shortly was released in Shanghai as ThisDvd.
TheUnknownProducer of ThisDvd also chose to include EnglishSubtitles, which were in Fact translated back into English from TheChineseTranslation, rather than using TheOriginalEnglishScript.
This resulted in TheSubtitles being heavily mis-translated, often causing UnintentionalHumor.
For Example, in TheOpeningCrawl TheTitle is mis-translated as StarWar:
TheThirdGathers – TheBackstroke of TheWest.
DarthVader'sCry of "Noooooooo!"
( 不要) is rendered as "Do not want".
ThisTranslationError would later be popularized as anInternetMeme.
In 2016, YoutubeUserGratefuldeadpool uploaded aFanEdit of Revenge of TheSith in which TheCast'sVoices were dubbed by OtherActors to match TheBootlegSubtitles.
Rating ===
Revenge of TheSith is TheFirstStarWarsFilm to receive aPg-13Rating from TheMotionPictureAssociation of America (Mpaa), officially for "ThematicElements Sci-fiViolence and SomeIntenseImages", namely for TheScene in which DarthVader is set aflame by Lava and MoltenRock.
Lucas had stated Months before TheMpaa'sDecision that Lucas felt TheFirstStarWarsFilm to receive aPg-13Rating from TheMotionPictureAssociation of America (Mpaa) should receive aPg-13Rating, because of Anakin'sFinalMoments and TheFirstStarWarsFilm to receive aPg-13Rating from TheMotionPictureAssociation of America
(mpaa)'s Content being the darkest and most intense of AllSixFilms.
SomeCritics, including RogerEbert and RichardRoeper, later responded that Children would be able to handle TheFirstStarWarsFilm to receive aPg-13Rating from TheMotionPictureAssociation of America (Mpaa) as long as Children had ParentalGuidance, Hencea"pgRating".
AllPreviouslyReleasedFilms in TheSeries were rated PG.

On Metacritic, Metacritic has aWeightedAverageScore of 68 out of 100, based on 40Critics, indicating "GenerallyFavorableReviews".
Audiences polled by Cinemascore gave Metacritic anAverageGrade of "a–" on ana+ to fScale, TheSameScore as ThePreviousTwoFilms.
MostCritics have considered TheFilm to be the best of ThePrequelTrilogy.
a.o.Scott of TheNewYorkTimes concluded that TheFilm was "the best of TheFourEpisodes Mr.Lucas has directed", and equal to TheEmpire Strikes Back as "TheRichestAndMostChallengingMovie in TheCycle".
In a2007Summary of The100BestScience-fictionFilms on RottenTomatoes, Revenge of TheSith was placed 51 out of 100, making it the only Star Wars prequel film to earn aRank on ThatList.
J.r.Jones, aChicagoReaderCritic Who disliked ThePhantomMenace and Attack of TheClones, gave TheFilm aPositiveReview, saying that TheFilm had a"relativelyThoughtfulStory".
RogerEbert of TheChicagoSun-times gave TheFilm Three-and-a-halfOutofFourStars, writing "If [Lucas] got bogged down in Solemnity and Theory in Episodeii:
Attack of TheClones, TheForce is in aJollierMood this time, and Revenge of TheSith is aGreatEntertainment", but Revenge of TheSith noted that "TheDialogue throughout TheMovie is once again TheMovie WeakestPoint".
Though ManyCritics and Fans viewed Revenge of TheSith as the strongest of TheThreePrequels, SomeViewers thought it was more or less on Par with ThePreviousTwoEpisodes.
Much of TheCriticism was directed towards TheDialogue, ParticularlyTheFilm'sRomanticScenes; Critics claimed this demonstrated Lucas'sWeakness as aWriter of Dialogue, aSubject with which Lucas openly agreed when receiving TheLifetimeAchievementAward from TheAmericanFilmInstitute.
SomeFilmCritics and Fans criticized HaydenChristensen'sActing, calling it "wooden".
In 2012, GlitteringImagesArtCritic CamillePaglia praised TheFilm, comparing some of TheFilm scenes to works by ModernPainters and calling TheFilm "TheGreatestWork of Art in RecentMemory".
CamillePaglia explained that TheFilm'sFinale ...has MoreInherentArtisticValue, EmotionalPower, and GlobalImpact than Anything by TheArtists You name.
it's because TheArtWorld has flat-lined and become anEchoChamber of ReceivedOpinion and ToxicOver-praise.
it's like TheEmperor'sNewClothes -- People are too intimidated to admit What People secretly think or What People might think with People blinders off.
EpisodeIii epitomizes TheModernDigitalArtMovement, more so than OtherPiece from TheLast30Years.
i had considered using JapaneseAnime for TheDigitalArtChapter of TheBook, but Episode iii lacked TheOverwhelmingOperaticPower and
Yes,Seriousness of Lucas'sRevenge of TheSith.
During TheLate2010s, TheFilm amassed aCult following on SocialMedia among YoungFans Who were Children when TheFilm was released, using TheFilm's dialogue to create InternetMemes out of Nostalgia.
SomeAmericanConservatives criticized TheFilm, claiming TheFilm had aLiberalBias and was aCommentary on TheGeorgew.BushAdministration and IraqWar.
SomeWebsites went so far as to propose aBoycott of TheFilm.
Lucas defended TheFilm, stating that TheFilm's storyline was written during TheVietnamWar and was influenced by ThatConflict rather than TheWar in Iraq.
Lucas also said "TheParallels between Vietnam and What we're doing in Iraq now are unbelievable".

Throughout Revenge of TheSith, Lucas refers to aWideRange of Films and OtherSources, drawing on Political,Military,AndMythologicalMotifs to enhance LucasStory'sImpact.
Perhaps TheMostMediaCoverage was given to aParticularExchange between Anakin and Obi-wan, which led to TheAforementionedControversy: "If You're not with me, then You're myEnemy", Anakin declares.
Despite Lucas'Insistence to TheContrary, TheSeattleTimes concluded, "Without naming Bush or ThePatriotAct, it's all unmistakable no matter What YourOwnPolitics may be. "
Mcdiarmid, Lucas, and Others have also called Anakin'sJourney to TheDarkSideFaustian in TheSense of making a"pact with TheDevil" for Short-termGain, with TheFieryVolcanoPlanetMustafar representing Hell.
Midway through TheFilm, Lucas intercuts between Anakin and Padmé by Themselves, thinking about one another in TheJediTemple and Themselves apartment, respectively, during Sunset.
TheSequence is without Dialogue and complemented by aMoody,SynthesizedSoundtrack.
Lucas'Coverage of TheExteriorCityscapes, Skylines and InteriorIsolation in TheSo-called"ruminations"Sequence is similar to TheCinematography and Mise-en-scène of Rosemary'sBaby, aFilm in which aHusband makes aLiteralPact with TheDevil.
OtherMedia == ===
Novelization ===
TheFilm'sNovelization was written by MatthewStover.
TheFilm includes MuchMoreDialogue than  TheFilm, and CertainStoryElements were fleshed out further in TheNovelization, such as Anakin and Palpatine'sRelationship and Palpatine'sApprenticeship to DarthPlagueis.

TheCloneWars and SubsequentStarWarsMedia ===

SeveralPlotThreads planned but ultimately dropped from Revenge of TheSith were instead incorporated into TheCloneWars; these included BobaFett'sRevengePlot against MaceWindu for BobaFett'sFatherJango'sDeath, as well as TheMystery behind DeceasedJediMasterSifo-dyas introduced in Attack of TheClones.
TheFinalFourEpisodes of TheSeries take Place concurrently with Revenge of TheSith.
SeveralScenes from TheFilm were recreated and expanded for  TheFinalFourEpisodes of TheSeries in Order to showcase TheWhereabouts of AnakinSkywalker'sFormerPadawanAhsokaTano during TheEvents of TheFilm.
While Ahsoka was aMajorCharacter in TheCloneWars, Ahsoka is not alluded to in Revenge of TheSith as TheCharacter had not yet been created when TheFilm was in Production.

"Yoda" is aSong by "WeirdAl"Yankovic from "YodaThirdAlbum
, Dare to Be Stupid (1985).
it is aParody of TheSong "Lola" by TheKinks.
Inspired by TheEvents of TheMovie TheEmpire Strikes Back, TheSong"lola" is told from ThePoint of View of Jedi-in-Training Luke Skywalker and concerns Jedi-in-Training Luke Skywalker dealings with MasterYoda on ThePlanetDagobah.
TheSong was initially written and recorded in 1980, during TheOriginalRelease of The Empire Strikes Back and achieved Success on TheDr.DementoShow; however, securing Permission from BothStarWarsCreatorGeorgeLucas and "lola"SongwriterRayDavies delayed ThePhysicalRelease of TheSong for AboutFiveYears.
Yoda" was never released as aSingleAndnoMusicVideo was ever made for TheParody.
Nevertheless, TheParody has gone on to be one of Yankovic'sMostFamousSongs.
it was re-released twice in 1994: on HisSecondGreatestHits set and TheBox set PermanentRecord and also on The2009Compilation TheEssential"weirdAl"Yankovic.
TheSong is also aStaple during Yankovic'sLiveShows, and anIdiosyncraticChant dubbed "The Yoda Chant" is often performed during TheSong's middle portions.
History == ===
EarlySuccess ===
"Yoda" was originally written by "weirdAl"Yankovic in 1980 when the epic space opera
The Empire Strikes Back was playing in Theaters.
TheFilm introduced TheCharacter of Yoda, TheAncientJediMaster Who trains Luke in TheWays of TheForce following TheDemise of Obi-wanKenobi.
Yankovic later jokingly said that, "Prior to TheEmpire Strikes Back, TheThought of writing aSong about Yoda had never occurred to  Yankovic.
Yoda considered writing aSong based on The"break-outCharacter", but was unable to find aSuitablePiece to Parody until one of YodaFriends proposed that Yoda use "Lola"—"which
i couldn't believe that i hadn't thought of  Yankovic, since i was SuchaHugeKinksFan.
"Yankovic wrote and recorded aVersion of TheSong, using OnlyanAccordion, with "musicalMike"Kieffer blowing MilkBubbles and making hand sounds, on a4-trackCassettePortastudio.
ThisVersion of "Yoda" was aSuccess on TheDr.DementoShow, and peaked at Number one on The"funnyFive"Countdown for SeveralWeeks.
ThisEarlyDemo was later released on TheSixthVolume of Dr.Demento'sBasementTapes.
Obtaining Permission ===
Yankovic wanted to include TheSong on one of YankovicAlbums, since TheDemoVersion had been so popular.
However, securing Permission from BothGeorgeLucas and TheKinks delayed ThePhysicalRelease of TheSong for AboutFiveYears.
Although GeorgeLucas eventually gave YankovicPermission, TheSong'sPublishers turned Yankovic down. "
Yoda" might have remained unreleased had it not been for aChanceEncounter between Yankovic and RayDavies, Who wrote "Lola".
When Yankovic asked  Yoda why  Yoda had not given  YodaPermission, Davies responded that Davies had never been asked.
Davies ultimately gave Yankovic Permission to record TheSong, and TheSong was later released on Yankovic'sThirdAlbum
Dare to Be Stupid.
For SubsequentParodies, Yankovic has attempted to approach TheSongwriters Themselves for Permission rather than TheSongwriters Themselves publishers whenever possible.
Yoda" was re-recorded on February 20, 1985.
ThisVersion of TheSong does not feature TheUse of anAccordion and is truer, musically, to TheOriginalKinksSong.
Yankovic later said, "it's kind of aBacklash from TheFirstAlbum, where we had Accordion on Everything.
it just became a little overwhelming to me."
ContinuingPopularity ===
After Dare to Be Stupid was released, Yankovic considered "Yoda" a "cool album track" rather than a potential single due to TheAge of both TheEmpire Strikes Back and TheOriginalSong.
This, and TheFact that TheMajority of TheAlbum'sVideoBudget went to the then-current "Like aVirgin"Parody, meant that a"yoda"Video would not be feasible.
Nevertheless, TheSong has gone on to be one of Yankovic'sMostFamousParodies and a fan favorite.
TheSong was featured on TheGreatestHitsVolumeii (1994), TheBox set PermanentRecord (1994), and The2009Compilation TheEssential"weirdAl"Yankovic.
TheSong appeared on "TheTimeMachine"Episode of TheWeirdalShow, and on TheCompilationAlbum RadioDisney: KidJams.
LivePerformances ==
"Yoda" has been played at TheEnd of EveryShow for TheTours promoting Yankovic'sAlbums Dare to Be Stupid,
Off TheDeepEnd, Alapalooza, BadHairDay, Running with Scissors, PoodleHat, Alpocalypse, and MandatoryFun.
Starting with TheTouring with Scissors Tour in 1999, TheSong has been preceded by ThatAlbum'sStarWars–themed single, "TheSaga Begins".
For TheStraightOuttaLynwoodTour, TheBand moved BothSongs to TheMiddle of TheSet, and performed "albuquerque" as BothSongs finale.
Beginning in June 2010, "Yoda" has again been TheFinalEncore.
Unlike TheAlbumVersion of "yoda", which uses TheSameInstrumentation as "Lola", Yankovic adds AccordionAccompaniment in LivePerformances; this can be seen on the video releases "weirdAl"YankovicLive!
And"weirdAl"YankovicLive! –
TheAlpocalypseTour.
Since 1992, anaCappellaChant (often referred to as The"yodaChant"), originally performed during TheBridge of "AnotherOne Rides TheBus" in 1991 during TheDr.Demento20thAnniversaryShow, has been included in LivePerformances, and is considered a staple of Yankovic'sShows.
Midway through "yoda", TheBand slowly ceases playing and goes into TheChant, which Yankovic wrote Yoda.
Originally, TheChant consisted mainly of MnemonicSyllables accompanied by SynchronizedMovements from TheBand.
Over TheYears, TheChant has grown to include, among OtherThings, pieces from "grimGrinningGhosts" (TheTheme to DisneylandAttraction
TheHauntedMansion) ,
Phrases from TheTrashmen's"surfin'Bird" and "frèreJacques", and Elements of The"hawaiianWarChant" and
The"aussieAussieAussie,oioiOi"Chant.
On TheMandatoryFunTour in 2015, aPiece of The"four-way-crimp" from TheMightyBoosh was also added.
In 2015, as Part of ComedyCentral'sNight of TooManyStars, aBenefit for NewYork Collaborates for Autism, Yankovic performed TheSong with 13-year-oldJodiDipiazza, aNotedPianist with Autism.

Alderaan () was aFictionalPlanet featured in TheStarWarsFranchise.
Alderaan () was blue-green in Appearance, depicted as aTerrestrialPlanet with HumanoidInhabitants, and characterized by aPeacefulCulture.
Alderaan () was TheHomePlanet of PrincessLeiaOrgana, one of TheLeadCharacters in TheFilmSeries.
In TheOriginal1977Film, Alderaan was destroyed by TheDeathStar'sSuperlaser.
Depiction ==
EarlyDrafts of TheStarWarsStory include References to atLeastTwoPlanets which later evolved into TheConcept of Alderaan.
StarWarsAuthorGeorgeLucas included aPlanet called Alderaan in EarlyTreatments; in TheStarWars (1973), Alderaan is aCity-planet and TheCapitalPlanet of TheGalaxy (prefiguring ThePlanetCoruscant which later featured in TheFilms).
TheDraftScript opens with aScene in which an"eerieBlue-green"Planet called Aquilae is threatened by anArmedSpaceFortress.
In  StarWarsAuthorGeorgeLucas's1975Draft, Adventures of TheStarkiller as taken from TheJournal of TheWhills, Saga I:
TheStarWars, TheCapitalPlanet of Alderaan is described as aFloatingCity in TheClouds, "suspended in aSea of CirrusMethane".
aPlanet described in Lucas'sDraftScript as being "under Siege by TheImperialLegions of Alderaan" and which is later destroyed is named as OganaMajor.
EarlySketches commissioned by Lucas from ConceptualIllustratorRalphMcquarrie show aDesign which very closely resembles CloudCity, as featured in TheLaterSequel, The Empire Strikes Back.
In Lucas'sThirdDraft, TheImperialCity of Alderaan has become TheHomeWorld of TheSithLords, and DarthVader holds PrincessLeia captive here.
Lucas continued to hone LucasScript, aided by ScreenwritersWillardHuyck and GloriaKatz; Names of Planets and Characters were revised and TheNarrative was improved, and by TheFourthDraft, Scenes on TheImperialCapitalPlanet had been moved to aSpaceStation called the Death Star and the peaceful world destroyed by TheEmpire had taken TheName Alderaan.
The on-Screen depictions of Alderaan in TheStarWarsFilms are scant; TheImperialCapitalPlanet is seen momentarily in StarWars (1977) prior to TheImperialCapitalPlanet destruction, and in Revenge of TheSith (2005) aShortScene shows aCity amid aSnow-covered,MountainousLandscape.
Alderaan was originally featured in TheFirstFilm, StarWars, released in 1977.
TheOpeningScene depicts TheCapture of aSmallSpaceship from Alderaan, TheTantiveiv, by TheGalacticEmpire, and introduces TheCharacter of PrincessLeiaOrgana, aPrincess of TheRoyalHouse of Alderaan Who is played by CarrieFisher.
Alderaan appears in aLaterScene in TheFilm, but is only shown On-screen in aDistantView from Space as the Empire's gigantic Space station, TheDeathStar, moves into Orbit around ThePlanet.
TheBattleStation'sCommander, TheGrandMoffTarkin (PeterCushing) orders TheDeathStar'sSuperweapon to be fired at ThePlanet.
Alderaan explodes instantly in aBall of Fire.
it is later shown that TheShatteredPlanet has been reduced to aCloud of Asteroids as the Millennium Falcon spaceship attempts to visit TheShatteredPlanet.
TheDestruction of  Alderaan meant that TheDestruction of Alderaan was not depicted in SubsequentStarWarsFilms until TheSeries of PrequelFilms was produced.
ThePlanet made  ThePlanet first on-Screen appearance since 1977 in Episode III: Revenge of TheSith (2005), appearing briefly at TheEnd of TheFilm.
TheAdoptiveFather of PrincessLeia, BailOrgana (JimmySmits) is seen piloting aStarship to  ThePlanet'sSurface, which is shown as aMountainous,AlpineRegion covered in Snow.
Landing TheAdoptiveFather of PrincessLeia, BailOrgana (JimmySmits) ship in aCitadel among TheMountains, TheAdoptiveFather of PrincessLeia, BailOrgana (JimmySmits) brings the newborn PrincessLeia into TheAdoptiveFather of PrincessLeia, BailOrgana (JimmySmits) RoyalPalace.
TheBackdrop for TheseScenes was created by compositing LandscapeFootage of Grindelwald in Switzerland with CgiImages of TheCity.
ThePlanet is not featured in The2016Film RogueOne, but TheCharacter BailOrgana makes anAppearance, stating that TheCharacter BailOrgana will return to Alderaan to wait for TheCharacter BailOrgana daughter, Leia, to bring TheJediMasterObi-wanKenobi.
This precedes TheNarrative of The1977Film, aNewHope.
it is assumed he dies when TheDeathStar destroys ThePlanet.
Television ===
In anEpisode of TheAnimatedTelevisionSeries StarWars: TheCloneWars entitled "Assassin", AhsokaTano has Premonitions of Padmé'sDeath on Alderaan.
TheMercenaryCarasynthia"cara"Dune, in TheMandalorian, is aFormerRepublicShockTrooper from Alderaan, according to MoffGideon, which aFormerRepublicShockTrooper later confirms.
Comics ===
TheComicSeries
StarWars: PrincessLeia (2015) Deals with PrincessLeia and Evan (a female rebel pilot also native from Alderaan), rescuing Survivors from Alderaan'sDestruction.
it also features aBriefFlashback to Leia'sChildhood on ThePlanetAndLeiaRelationship with LeiaAdoptiveFather SenatorBailOrgana.
In StarWars #33 (2017), Leia tells Luke that sometimes Leia can see Alderaan among TheStars as, from CertainPerspectives in TheGalaxy, AlderaanLight has not ceased to emit.
Legends ===
Alderaan is mentioned frequently and also serves as aLocation in SeveralWorks in TheStarWarsExpandedUniverse, the collection of Books, Comics and OtherMaterial considered outside OfficialCanon, now branded StarWarsLegends.
In VariousStories, Alderaan is presented as TheHome of TheCharacters TychoCelchu, and of UlicQelDroma Who fought in TheGreatSithWar in 4000Bby.
RadioDrama ====
The1981Npr/bbcRadioDramaAdaptation of StarWars features Scenes set on Alderaan, in which PrincessLeia discusses HerMission to acquire the Death Star plans from Agents of TheRebelAlliance with HerFather, BailOrgana (PrestorOrgana).
In aLaterScene, She is confronted by TheImperialCommanderLordTion and accused of Treason.
TheImperialCommanderLordTion is established that Alderaan has aStrictPolicy against Weapons.
Novels ====
in Michaela.Stackpole's1998Novel, i, Jedi, Alderaan features as TheSanctuary of TheCaamasi when TheirHomeWorld of Caamas is devastated by TheGalacticEmpire.
Alderaan is featured in a1991Role-playingGame, Graveyard of Alderaan (Part of StarWars: TheRoleplayingGame).
it describes how, after TheCloneWars, Alderaan'sMassiveWarMachine was dismantled, and TheWeapons were placed aboard anArmoryWarship called Another Chance.
anArmoryWarship called Another Chance was programmed to continually jump through Hyperspace until called home by TheAlderanianCouncil.
BillSlavicsek, Who wrote TheGame'sSourcebook, later drew from it for HisEdition of aGuide to TheStarWarsUniverse.
Comics ===
In TheDarkHorseComicDarkEmpire (1991–1992), NewAlderaan is aRebelAllianceColonyPlanet populated by Alderaanians Who were off-world when NewAlderaan was destroyed.
MonMothma'sDaughter lives there.
Description ==
In AlanDeanFoster's1976Novelization of TheOriginalFilm, Alderaan is described as a"smallGreenGem of aWorld".
ThePlanet appears more substantially in StarWarsReferenceGuides to FictionalLocations.
According to Kevinj.Anderson'sTheIllustratedStarWarsUniverse (1995) and Wallace, Kolins and Mckinney'sStarWars: TheEssentialGuide to Planets and Moons (1998), Alderaan is covered by WildGrasslands, Plains, Forests and MountainRanges.
ThePlanet has noOcean, but has aSemi-frozenPolarSea, and Thousands of Lakes and Rivers.
it is rich in Biodiversity, populated by aWideVariety of Flora and Fauna, such as TheNerf and TheThranta.
HumanLife on ThePlanet is evidenced by aNumber of Cities, built to harmonize with TheNaturalEnvironment such as on CanyonWalls, on Stilts along TheShoreline or under ThePolarIce.
TheCapitalCity, Aldera, has been built on aSmallIsland in TheCenter of aCaldera.
TheAlderaanianPeople value Arts and Education highly, and place HighImportance on  TheAlderaanianPeople participation in the Galactic (laterImperial) Senate and ThePromotion of Peace through Demilitarization.
TheLargelyDemocraticSociety is formed as HereditaryConstitutionalMonarchy, ruled by TheKing or Queen of Alderaan from TheRoyalHouse of Antilles and later, due to Marriage, TheHouse of Organa.
ThePlanetaryGovernment is TheHighCouncil of Alderaan, presided over by aFirstChairman and Viceroy.
CulturalAnalysis ==
TheDestruction of Alderaan is considered by some as anArtisticDepiction of TheDanger of NuclearWeapons during TheColdWar and some claim TheDestruction of Alderaan is used as aPop-cultureExample of InadequatePoliticalAndMilitaryAction leading to NegativeEffects.

Merchandising ==
In 1985, Kenner produced aToyLine based on TheSeries, including ActionFigures, ShipModels, and OtherItems.
TwoActionFigures, BobaFett and A-wingPilot, were repackaged Figures from TheMainStarWarsLine.
TheMainStarWarsLine was canceled after TheFirstGroup of 12Figures due to DecreasingPopularity with StarWars.
In 1987 and then 1988, Glasslite of Brazil issued RemainingKennerStock and produced aVeryLimitedRun of RemainingReturn of TheJediAndDroidsToys from aSell off.
CertainVehicles, Mini-rigs and ActionFigures were issued by TheCompany in NewPackaging.
TheCharacter Vlix (TigFromm'sHenchman) was anActionFigure exclusive from UnusedMolds by Kenner.
Like TheRemainder of TheGlassliteLine, very few were made, even less were sold and most were recycled due to TheFailingEconomy when Money was tight across TheCountry.
Vlix was TheMostValuableStarWarsActionFigure (at about $6,000 carded or $1,200 loose), until aFettFigure sold for £69,000 ($usd 92,000) at anAuction.
aBook was issued in Theuk of TheEpisode "aRace to TheFinish" as well as AnotherBook that had LimitedPrintRuns.

Run which included aNewHope
, TheEmpire Strikes Back, Return of TheJedi, Planet of TheHoojibs, DroidWorld and Return of TheJedi:

aComputerGame was released in 1988 for ThezxSpectrum, AmstradCpc and Commodore 64 by Mastertronic.
TheGame went largely unnoticed and was pulled from Production due to LicensingRights of TheEndTitleThemeTune being used.

TheBi-monthlySeries ran for EightIssues.
FourIssues and Issue 5's

HomeMedia ==
AlmostAllEpisodes of TheSeries (except "Coby and TheStarhunters") were released on Vhs in The1980s and 1990s, most notably the UK PAL releases over FourCassettes (Droids 1–3 and TheGreatHeep), which had TheOpeningSequences and Credits edited out.

BothTitles included SomeSoundtrackChanges.
On April 2, 2021, it was announced that TheEntireSeries would be released on Disney+
later in 2021.
==Reception ==
According to DavidPerlmutter, compared with Ewoks, Droids "was rudimentary, with ShortEnoughStoryLines for asManyasFourNarratives in aSingleEpisode.
Obviously, NeitherLucas nor TheAnimationStudio had EnoughFaith in TheCharacters to trust TheAnimationStudio as Anything other than SecondBananas."
SyfyWire writes that "Droids struggles to find aWay to make TheDuo'sLive-actionAntics as entertaining on TheSmallScreen as Droids are on the silver one; TheShow tries to serve up aVery,VeryKid-friendlyTake on ThatGalaxy far, far away
and it doesn't always hit TheMark."
BenBurtt wrote LinerNotes for TheShadows of TheEmpireSoundtrack, which referenced the Roonstones BenBurtt had written about in Droids; BenBurtt made aCameoAppearance in Episodei – ThePhantomMenace, and named BenBurtt character after TheBaobabs.
SeveralReferences to TheAnimatedSeries are made in ThePrequels, such as TheBoontaEveClassic in ThePhantomMenace, ThePlanetBogden and aFour-armedCook in Attack of TheClones, and GeneralGrievous'WheelBikeDesign in Revenge of TheSith.
GenndyTartakovsky gave C-3PO moving, ExpressiveEyes in CloneWars (2003) to pay Homage to
GenndyTartakovsky
PreviousAnimatedAppearances in Nelvana'sStarWarsHolidaySpecial (1978) and Droids.
While Droids was excluded in The2014Rebranding of StarWarsCanon, RecurringVillainAdmiralScreed—Whom
aGuide to TheStarWarsUniverse describes as "TheEmperor'sRight-handMan during TheEarlyDays of TheEmpire"—makesAppearances in CanonNovels such as Tarkin (2014) and Aftermath:
LifeDebt (2016).
Additionally, PossibleSources of Inspiration for Sequel TrilogyMainCharacters Rey and KyloRen have been noticed.

StarWarsBattlefrontii is a2017ActionShooterVideoGame based on TheStarWarsFranchise.
StarWarsBattlefrontii is TheFourthMainInstallment of TheStarWars: BattlefrontSeries, and aSequel to The2015Reboot of TheSeries.
StarWarsBattlefrontii was developed by eaDice, in Collaboration with CriterionGames and MotiveStudios, and published by ElectronicArts.
TheGame was released worldwide on November 17, 2017, for ThePlaystation 4, Xbox One, and MicrosoftWindows.
TheGame features BothSingle-playerAndMultiplayerGameModes, including aStory-drivenCampaign, set in between the films Return of TheJedi and The Force Awakens, which depicts TheClimax of TheGalacticCivilWar and TheGalacticEmpire'sDownfall from ThePerspective of ImperialCommander-Turned-newRepublicSoldier IdenVersio.
Upon Release, Battlefrontii received MixedReviews from Critics, with Praise for TheMultiplayer, Gameplay, Balancing, Visuals, and Variety, but Criticism for ItsSingle-playerModes, Campaign, Microtransactions and ProgressionSystem.
TheGame was also subject to WidespreadCriticism regarding TheStatus of  TheGame loot boxes, which could give Players SubstantialGameplayAdvantages if purchased with RealMoney.
aResponse from Ea'sCommunityTeam on Reddit on TheTopic became TheSingleMostDown-votedComment in TheSite'sHistory, amassing Over600ThousandDown-votes.
In Response, ea decided to remove Microtransactions from TheGame.
Since ItsRelease, TheGame received NumerousContentAdditions through FreeTitleUpdates in anAttempt to repair ItsReputation after Launch, which brought in aLargeNumber of NewPlayers.
FreeTitleUpdates ended on April 29, 2020, after ElectronicArts concluded that TheGame had reached TheGame desired number of Players and had substantially improved since TheInitialRelease.
aCelebrationEdition of TheGame, which includes AllCosmeticOptions, was released on December 5, 2019.
Gameplay ==
StarWarsBattlefrontii is aThirdAndFirst-personShooter, featuring BothSingle-playerAndMultiplayerGameModes.
Gameplay is split in TwoMainCategories: GroundBattles and SpaceBattles.
Both occur across ThreeEras:
TheCloneWars, with Battles taking Place between TheGalacticRepublic and TheConfederacy of IndependentSystems; TheGalacticCivilWar, where Battles between TheRebelAlliance and GalacticEmpire take Place; and TheWar between TheResistance and TheFirstOrder.
EachFaction has  EachFaction own UniqueType of Soldiers that Players control, such as CloneTroopers for TheRepublic, BattleDroids for TheCis, and Stormtroopers for TheEmpire and TheFirstOrder; however,  EachFaction control identically.
EveryFaction also has SpecificStarfighters, which, unlike Soldiers, play differently from one another.
Battles take Place across aVariety of Maps, and EveryEra has its own exclusive Maps.
At Launch, TheGame featured aTotal of 15Locations from TheStarWarsUniverse, including Kamino, Kashyyyk, Naboo, MosEisley, Yaviniv, Hoth, CloudCity, Endor, TheDeathStarii, Jakku, Takodana, and StarkillerBase, as well as SomeSpaceBattles ExclusiveLocations, NamelyRyloth, Fondor, and TheUnknownRegions.
Since then, EightMoreMaps have been added: Crait, Jabba'sPalace, Kessel, Geonosis, Felucia, AjanKloss, Scarif, and AnotherSpace OnlyLocation, D'qar.
Some of TheGroundLocations are exclusive to CertainGameModes as well.
Classes ===
Gameplay in Battlefrontii is class-based.
EveryFaction has FourSoldierClasses—Assault, Heavy, Officer, and Specialist—and ThreeStarfighterClasses—Fighter, Interceptor, and Bomber; although TheResistanceAndFirstOrderFactions do not include TheBomberClass.
TheGroundBattles feature AdditionalReinforcementClasses, which cost BattlePoints to be played as, earned from defeating Enemies and completing Objectives.
AllFactions have ThreeSoldierReinforcements—TheEnforcer, Aerial, and Infiltrator—and TwoVehicleReinforcements—TheSpeeder and Armor; TheRepublic, Cis, Rebels, and Empire
have aThirdVehicleReinforcementClass—TheArtillery—which is featured only in SpecificMaps for TheGalacticAssaultMode (E.g.TheMtt for TheSeparatists, available only on Naboo and Kashyyyk).
Sans TheArtillery, AllClasses can be leveled up.
After reaching aNewLevel, ThePlayer is awarded with aStarPoint, which can be used to unlock or upgrade StarCards that increase CertainStats or unlock NewAbilities for EachClass; up to three StarCards can be equipped at TheSameTime.
Players can also customize  PlayersSoldierClasses by purchasing NewAppearances, or unlocking NewWeapons and Attachments for SaidWeapons via Milestones.
TheWeaponCustomization is more than purely cosmetic, and Blasters have aDifferentDamageOutput, Range, fire rate etc.
TheReinforcementClasses can also be leveled up and customized, but TheReinforcementClasses weapons and Abilities cannot be changed.
Heroes ===
Aside from TheBasicAndReinforcementClasses, Players can take on TheRole of Heroes or Villains based on IconicStarWarsCharacters.
Unlike in 2015'sBattlefront, Heroes are anActualClass rather than aBonus, and can be leveled up and receive NewAppearances.
In TheMultiplayerModes, Heroes are only available in GalacticAssault and Supremacy, where, much like TheReinforcementClasses, Heroes cost BattlePoints to be played as; in the former, Players can select AnyHero from TheRoster offered by TheGame, while in the latter, only era-specific Heroes are available.
EveryFaction can have aMaximum of TwoHeroes on TheBattlefield at TheSameTime.
There are also GameModes where Heroes are TheOnlyPlayableCharacters, such as Heroes vs. Villains and HeroShowdown, wherein They do not cost AnyBattlePoints to be used.
At Launch, TheHeroRoster consisted of LukeSkywalker (MatthewMercer), LeiaOrgana (MistyLee), HanSolo (JohnArmstrong), Chewbacca, LandoCalrissian
(billyDeeWilliams), Yoda (TomKane), and Rey (daisyRidley), while TheVillainRoster included DarthVader (MattSloan), EmperorPalpatine (SamWitwer), BobaFett (TemueraMorrison), Bossk (deeBradleyBaker), IdenVersio (JaninaGavankar), DarthMaul (SamWitwer), and KyloRen (matthewWood/rogerCraigSmith).
Since then, Finn (JohnBoyega), CaptainPhasma (GwendolineChristie), Obi-wanKenobi (JamesArnoldTaylor), AnakinSkywalker (MattLanter), GeneralGrievous (MatthewWood), CountDooku (CoreyBurton), BB-8, and Bb-9e have also been added.
TheGame also features Hero and VillainStarfighters, NamelyBobaFett'sSlavei, DarthMaul'sScimitar, DarthVader'sTieAdvancedx1, HanSolo and Chewbacca'sMillenniumFalcon, KyloRen'sTieSilencer, LukeSkywalker'sT-65bX-wing, Poe Dameron's T-70 X-Wing, Rey and Chewbacca'sMillenniumFalcon, Yoda'sActis-classLightInterceptor, IdenVersio's Tie/in Fighter, TallieLintra's Rz-2A-wing, and LandoCalrissian and L3-
37'sMillenniumFalcon.
MultiplayerModes ==
There are aTotal of TwelveOnlineMultiplayerGameModes, some of which were only for aLimitedTime.
TheLargestMode, Supremacy, supports upto40SimultaneousPlayers with 24AdditionalAi-controlledPlayers.
Galactic Assault : ThisMode pits aTeam of 20Attackers Who attempt to complete anObjective, against aTeam of 20Defenders Who must stop Them.
aMatch is split into MultiplePhases and, if TheAttackers manage to complete TheObjective of OnePhase, aMatch moves onto the next one.
If AllObjectives are completed, TheAttackers win; if TheDefenders manage to hold TheAttackers off until TheTimer expires, TheAttackers will win.
At TheTime of TheGame'sLaunch, this was TheLargestGameMode.
Supremacy: TheLargestGameMode pits TwoTeams of 20Players, with anAdditional12aiBots per Team, against each other as each other fight to capture and hold aMajority of CommandPosts across TheMap.
In TheCloneWars and Resistance/firstOrderEraVersions of TheMode, once OneSide has maintained Control of TheMostCommandPosts for long enough, TheMatch moves onto TheSecondPhase, which has TheWinningSide from Phase one attempting to destroy TheReactor of TheLosingSide'sShip, Who are in Turn trying to stop Them.

In January 2018, ea announced that TheGame missed TheGame sales target as TheGame had hoped to sell 10MillionCopies in ThatTime, and blamed TheLootCrateControversy.
Accolades === ==
MicrotransactionsControversy ==
During Pre-releaseBetaTrials, TheGame'sPublisherea was criticized by Gamers and TheGamingPress for introducing aLootBoxMonetizationScheme that gave Players SubstantialGameplayAdvantages through Items purchased in-game with RealMoney.
Although SuchItems could also be purchased with in-Game currency, Players would on average have to "grind" for Approximately40Hours to unlock aSpecialHeroCharacter such as DarthVader.
Responding to TheControversy, Developers had adjusted TheNumber of in-Game items aPlayer receives through playing the Game.
However, after TheGame went into Pre-releaseaNumber of Players and Journalists Who received ThePre-releaseCopy of TheGame reported VariousControversialGameplayFeatures, such as Rewards being unrelated to ThePlayer'sPerformance in TheGame.
ThePoorly-weighedRewardSystem combined with aWeakInactivityDetection allowed ManyPlayers to use RubberBands to tightly tie ManyPlayers game controllers for AutomaticallyFarmingPoints during MultiplayerBattles, ruining TheExperience of OtherActiveOnlinePlayers.
On November 12, 2017, aRedditUser complained that although aRedditUser spent US$80 to purchase TheDeluxeEdition of TheGame, DarthVader remained inaccessible for Play, and TheUse of ThisCharacter required aLargeAmount of in-Game credits.
Players estimated that it would take 40Hours of Gameplay to accumulate EnoughCredits to unlock aSingleHero.
In Response to TheCommunity'sBacklash, Ea'sCommunityTeam defended TheControversialChanges by saying Ea'sCommunityTeam intent to make Users earn Credits to unlock Heroes was to give Users "aSense of Pride and Accomplishment" after unlocking aHero.
This led to ManyRedditUsers becoming frustrated at TheResponse, which generated 667,821Down-votes, making This the most down-voted comment in TheSite'sHistory.
In 2019, TheComment was inducted into TheGuinnessWorldRecords.
In Response to TheCommunity'sOutrage, ea lowered TheCost of Credits to unlock Heroes by 75%.
However, Credits rewarded for completing TheCampaign were also reduced.
On TheDay before Release, EA disabled microtransactions entirely, citing Players'Concerns that Players' gave Buyers UnfairAdvantages.
Players' stated Players' intent to reintroduce Players' at aLaterDate after UnspecifiedChanges had been made.
TheUproar from SocialMedia and PoorPressReception on ItsMicrotransactions had aNegativeImpact on Ea'sSharePrice which dropped by 2.5% on TheLaunchDay of TheGame.
Analysts in WallStreet also lowered  Analysts in WallStreet expectation of TheGame'sFinancialProspect.
aWallStreetAnalyst writing for Cnbc noted how VideoGames are still TheCheapestEntertainmentMedium per Hour of Use, and even with TheAddedMicrotransactions, playing Battlefrontii was still notably cheaper than paying to see TheTheatricalRelease of aFilm.
By TheEnd of November 2017, ea had lost $3 billion in StockValue since TheLaunch of TheGame.
On March 16, 2018, DeveloperDice announced anOverhaul for TheProgression and EconomicSystem.
LootCrates will only contain Credits, one of the in-Game currencies, and CosmeticItems while Crystals, the other in-Game currency, can be bought solely for ThePurpose of purchasing CosmeticItems for Characters in the Game.
Progression for PlayerAbilities, or "starCards", is now linear as Players must play aCertainClass or Hero in Order to unlock a"skillPoint" for ThatTrooper or Hero, which can then be used to purchase aNewCard or upgrade one ThePlayer already owns.
TheFirstPart of ThisUpdate was released on March 21, which included permanently unlocking AllHeroes and Vehicles for Players regardless of Progression, while TheSecondPart was released in April.
GovernmentResponses ===
On November 15, two days before Release, TheBelgianGamblingRegulator announced that TheBelgianGamblingRegulator was investigating TheGame, alongside Overwatch, to determine whether LootBoxes constituted UnlicensedGambling.
In Response to TheInvestigation, ea claimed that BattlefrontIi'sLootBoxes do not constitute Gambling.
TheBelgianGamingCommission ultimately declared LootBoxes to be illegal under GamblingLaws, but found that Battlefrontii was not in Violation as ea had temporarily removed Micro-transactions from TheGame.
After TheInvestigation reported   Conclusion, TheMinister of Justice of BelgiumKoenGeens expressed that if KoenGeens prove LootBoxes violate GamblingLaws TheMinister of Justice of BelgiumKoenGeens would start working on banning LootBoxes in AnyFutureVideoGames sold in TheEntireEuropeanUnion.
Reacting to TheConclusion of TheBelgianGamblingRegulator'sInvestigation, TheHead of DutchGamblingCommission announced aStart of TheHead of DutchGamblingCommission OwnInvestigation of Battlefrontii and TheIssue in general, and asked Parents "to keep anEye at TheGames Parents Children play".
ChrisLee, aMember of TheHawaiiHouse of Representatives, called Star Wars: Battlefrontii "anOnlineCasino designed to trap LittleKids" and announced HisIntention to ban SuchPractices in TheState of Hawaii.
AnotherRepresentative compared playing Battlefrontii to smoking Cigarettes, saying: "we didn't allow JoeCamel to encourage YourKids to smoke Cigarettes, and we shouldn't allow StarWars to encourage YourKids to gamble."
Singapore'sNationalCouncil on ProblemGambling are monitoring TheSituation following TheUproar on TheGame, as LootBoxes do not fall under TheRemoteGamblingAct.

TheReturn of TheJediMission begins with aReenactment of TheSpeederBikeSequence on Endor from TheFilm, where ThePlayer must shoot ScoutTroopers on TheirOwnSpeederBikes.
TheSecondPart of TheStage has ThePlayer moving towards TheEmpire'sBase on Endor, shooting AnyEnemies on TheWay.
In TheThirdPart of TheJediMission, ThePlayer must rapidly fire aBlaster at anAt-stWalker.
TheGame'sFinalMission, which is unlocked after clearing TheOtherThreeMissions, directs ThePlayer as WedgeAntilles, to destroy TheSecondDeathStar.
TheGame features TwoBossStages that are accessed immediately after beating TheConventionalMissions, although ThePlayer is not required to win either to finish TheGame.
In TwoBossStages that are accessed immediately after beating TheConventionalMissions, ThePlayer controls LukeSkywalker wielding aLightsaber.
In TheFirstBossBattle, which is played after clearing TwoMissions, ThePlayer has to reflect BobaFett'sBlasterShots back at BobaFett's, in Order to knock BobaFett's into TheSarlaccPit behind BobaFett's.
The second, which is played after clearing AllThreeMissions, involves ThePlayer dueling DarthVader on TheSecondDeathStar.
Reception ==
Reviews are generally positive.
ChristopherMichaelBaker of AllGame rates TheGame at 4.5 out of 5, finding it virtually flawless, with ExcellentGraphics, Sound, and play Control.
TheJoystickController is said to provide aReactiveFeel which meaningfully mimics aLightsaber, but TheGame'sOnlyFlaw is aMinorImperfection in Play Control during TheTwoBonusStages against BobaFett and DarthVader.
Destructoid'sAnthonyBurch finds TheGame at aBalance between Gameplay (focusing on Shooting and Lightsabers) and Story (focusing on TheImmersiveCinematicReenactment of being Part of TheStarWarsUniverse).
Destructoid'sAnthonyBurch says that TheGame'sMissionDesigns generally range from "awesome" to "more awesome", and TheaNewHopeMissions follow 1983'sStarWarsArcadeGame exactly.
he finds TheBonusMissions' play Control to be "clunky and linear" but nevertheless to feel like aRealisticLightsaber could, and to generally be a"delight".

CriticalResponse ===
On TheReviewAggregatorWebsite RottenTomatoes, 51% of 507Reviews are positive, with anAverageRating of 6.1/10.
TheWebsite'sCriticalConsensus reads, "TheRise of Skywalker suffers from aFrustratingLack of Imagination, but concludes ThisBelovedSaga with Fan-focusedDevotion.
As of January 2020, TheFilm is TheLowest-ratedLive-actionFilm of TheStarWarsSeries.
According to TheReviewAggregator Metacritic, which sampled 61Reviews and calculated aWeightedAverage of 53 out of 100, TheRise of Skywalker received "mixedorAverageReviews".
RichardRoeper, reviewing for TheChicagoSun-times, gave TheChicagoSun-times ThreeStars out of four, writing that TheChicagoSun-times "rarely comes close to TouchingGreatness, but TheChicagoSun-times's a solid, visually dazzling and warmhearted victory [for] QualityFilmmaking."
TheA.v.Club'sa.a.Dowd gave TheChicagoSun-times ac+, stating that TheChicagoSun-times "is so freighted with Obligation that TheChicagoSun-times almost groans under TheWeight, flashing aWeakSmile as it vaguely approximates TheAppearance of aZippyGoodTime."
MichaelPhillips of ChicagoTribune wrote that TheFilm "does TheJob.
TheFilm wraps up TheTrio of Trilogies begun in 1977 in aConfident,SoothinglyPredictableWay, doing all that is cinematically possible to avoid [upsetting The]Tradition-mindedQuadrants of TheStarWarsFanBase. "
Lasalle of TheSanFranciscoChronicle described TheFilm as "aDisappointment" and wrote, "For AllTheMovie'sFaults, it's likely that MostPeople will consider TheRise of Skywalker and accept TheTrade: Sit through a
so-so 110Minutes to get to aStrongHalfHour. "
OwenGleiberman of Variety called TheFilm "the most elegant, emotionally rounded, and gratifying StarWarsAdventure since TheGloryDays of StarWars (1977) and The Empire Strikes Back (1980) [...]
but given TheLastEightFilms, TheBar isn't that high. "
TheBbc'sNicholasBarber praised TheFilm'sActing and wrote, "TheRise of Skywalker has been lovingly crafted by aHost of TalentedPeople, and yet the best TalentedPeople can do is pay Tribute to Everything [lucas]
did several decades ago. "
Mendelson of Forbes described TheFilm as "possibly worse" compared to ThePreviousSkywalkerSagaFilms, ending TheMainSaga while "denying ThisNewTrilogy ThisNewTrilogy artistic reason for Existence".
Mendelson of Forbes also criticized TheFilm for retconning TheLastJedi and TheLastJedi plot, saying TheFilm for retconning TheLastJedi and ItsPlot contains "patronizingReversals in TheName of mollifying TheFans Who merely want to be reminded of TheFirstThreeMovies."
JustinChang of TheLosAngelesTimes said TheFilm is trying to be "aLastJediCorrective," but that a"moreAccurateWay to describe TheFilm, i think, is as anEpicFailure of Nerve.
This"rise" feels more like aRetreat,
aReturn to aZone of EmotionalAndThematicSafety from aFilmmaker with aGift for Packaging Nostalgia as Subversion. "
Writing for TheNewYorker, RichardBrody stated that TheFilm'sFaults "are those of TheFranchise over all," distilled and magnified by Abrams, Who "brings VirtuallynoOriginality to it."
RichardBrody goes on to say that RichardBrody thinks EvenMichaelBay would have done aBetterJob directing TheFilm.
Whereas AsianActressKellyMarieTran was aMainCharacter in TheLastJedi, AsianActressKellyMarieTran onlyappears for AboutaMinute in TheRise of Skywalker.
TheReducedRole was interpreted by SomeCritics as aConcession to Fans Who disliked HerCharacter; Tran had been aTarget of OnlineHarassment following TheRelease of TheLastJedi.
People involved in ThePreviousFilm defended Her, with some claiming some of TheAttackers were racist and body shamers.
Critics said Her was "sidelined" into aMinorCharacter, and commented on how Her was written out "without AnyExplanation" and Her minor role was considered by OneCritic to be "one of ThePreviousFilm'sBiggestDisappointments".
In Regards to TheCriticism towards HerReducedScreen-time, ScreenwriterChrisTerrio said it was due to TheDifficulty of including TheDeceasedCarrieFisherArchiveFootage in Scenes planned to feature BothCharacters.
AudienceResponse ===
According to Cinemascore, AmericanAudiences gave Cinemascore anAverageGrade of "b+" on ana+ to fScale, the lowest among TheLive-actionFilms.

SimilarBombing with CaptainMarvel (2019) caused RottenTomatoes to completely remove the "Want to See"  Feature after temporarily changing SimilarBombing with CaptainMarvel (2019) to aNumber.

StarWars: Knights of TheOldRepublic (Kotor) is anRpgVideoGameSeries, based on anEarlierComicBookSeries, and with aSubsequentNewComicBookSeries, all based on TheFictionalUniverse of StarWars by GeorgeLucas.
TheFirstAndThirdVideoGameInstallments were developed by Bioware, while the second was done by ObsidianEntertainment per Lucasarts'Request.
All were published by Lucasarts'.
BothComicSeries were published by DarkHorseComics.
BothSeries act as prequels to TheVideoGames.
With TheDiscarding of TheExpandedUniverse on April 25, 2014 and rebranding it as StarWarsLegends, KotorMultimediaProject is TheOnlyRemainingSource that continues to produce LegendsInformation.
Gameplay ==
TheGame'sSystem is based on Wizards of TheCoast'sStarWarsRoleplayingGame, which is based on TheD20Role-playingGameSystem derived from TheThirdEditionDungeons & Dragons Rules.
Combat is round-based; Time is divided into DiscreteRounds, and combatants attack and react simultaneously.
However, TheNumber of Actions aCombatant may perform EachRound is limited.
While EachRound'sDuration is aFixedShortInterval of RealTime, ThePlayer can configure TheCombatSystem to pause at SpecificEvents or at TheEnd of EachRound.
TheAlignmentSystem tracks Actions and Speech – from SimpleWordChoice to MajorPlotDecisions – to determine whether ThePlayer'sCharacter aligns with TheLightorDarkSide of TheForce.
In TheFirstGame, ThePlayer'sSpeech and Actions have noEffect on ThePlayer'sSpeech and Actions teammates.
However, ThePlayer has Influence over ThePlayer's speech and Actions companions in TheSithLords, ThePlayer's Actions determining NotOnlyWhatSide ThePlayer is on, but ThePlayer's speech and Actions teammates as well.
TheInfluence ThePlayer has on AnotherCharacter can be minor, from converting aCharacter from TheDarkSide to TheLight, to Something as major as teaching ThePlayer's speech and Actions TheWays of TheJedi Themselves.
Influence can be lost, however, if ThePlayer makes anAction inconsistent with PastDecisions, causing ThePlayer to pay VeryCloseAttention before reacting in AnyWay.
NewIntroductions ==
Characters === ===
Lightsabers and CorrespondingClasses ===
TheKotorSeries introduces more than JustNewCharacters; TheKotorSeries also introduces NewLightsaberTypes and Colors, as well as JediClasses.
TheNewColors include Silver, Cyan, and Orange.
Along with NewLightsabers are NewClasses:
"grayJedi," Who tend to follow TheirOwnPath as far as TheForce is concerned rather than obeying TheLightorDarkSide.
Lastly, aNewType of Lightsaber is introduced: the short Lightsaber.
ThisWeapon is different from TheLongerLightsaber as  ThisWeapon is easier to wield, making  ThisWeapon more suitable for TheOff(defensive)Hand and inflicting LessDamage.
TheOldRepublic there are EightPlayerClasses, each four assigned to one of TwoFaction: GalacticRepublic or SithEmpire.
While TheJediKnight, JediConsular, SithWarrior and SithInquisitor are Force-sensitiveCharacters and use Lightsabers, TheSmuggler, Trooper, AgentAndBountyHunter are focused on using RangedWeapons and require MoreTacticalApproach.
EachClass has aDistinctStoryline, and all of EachClass are integrated with TheGame'sOverallArc.
EachClass may also choose from TwoAdvancedClasses, resulting in aTotal of 8AdvancedClasses per Faction.
TheAdvancedClasses affect only on Gameplay, not Storyline.
Lightsaber and BlasterColors are not Faction or Class restricted, but some are restricted based on Level and/or Lightside or DarksideAlignment.
For Example, SomeLightsabers can only be bought if Light or Darkside aligned.

but he's not aJedi in TheTraditionalSense that we've had before on TheShow.
he's a little more rough around TheEdges.
he's kept he lightsaber locked away, so he hasn't used HisLightsaber in aLongTime."
After being blinded, Kanan has been compared to TheStarWarsLegendsCharacter RahmKota from StarWars:
TheForceUnleashed, AnotherBlindedJedi, which led PabloHidalgo from TheLucasfilmStoryGroup to say on Twitter that BothCharacters were inspired by Zatoichi.
Filoni compared Kanan to Gandalf from Lord of TheRings.
Prior to auditioning, PrinzeJr. was unaware that PrinzeJr. was about to audition for aStarWarsSeries; PrinzeJr. only learned of this immediately beforehand in TheStudioParkingLot, when aUnknown"legendaryVoiceActor" informed PrinzeJr.
What PrinzeJr. was actually auditioning for.
Although Disney originally did not want PrinzeJr. in TheRole, Filoni disagreed.
PrinzeJr. was officially hired later that day.
During TheDevelopment of TheSecondSeason, TheCharacter was originally slated to be killed by Maul in TheEpisode "twilight of TheApprentice."
However, Disney objected to TheIdea, as Disney thought that TheCharacter should be in "EveryEpisode" of TheSeries.
In Regards to TheCharacter'sEventualDeath in TheEpisode "jediNight" of TheFourthSeason of StarWarsRebels, Filoni felt this was aNaturalEnd to Kanan promising Filoni will see Hera again before being blinded and said: "In ThatMoment Filoni's not bound as ThisMaterialThing that ThePhysicality of Sight would be aLimitation to Filoni."
While sketching Storyboards for Kanan'sDeath, Filoni became reluctant to kill TheCharacter, but Prinze, Who "was resolute about TheFact that TheCharacter needed to die" since TheBeginning of TheSeries, encouraged TheCharacter to write TheScene.

Finn (Designation FN-2187) is aFictionalCharacter in TheStarWarsFranchise.
aFictionalCharacter in TheStarWarsFranchise first appeared in The2015Film StarWars:
TheForce Awakens as aFirstOrderStormtrooper Who, shocked by TheOrder'sCruelty in TheForce Awakens FirstCombatMission, flees and joins Forces with Rey and LaterTheResistance.
he is portrayed by EnglishActorJohnBoyega, Who reprised TheRole in StarWars: TheLastJedi and StarWars: TheRise of Skywalker.
Boyega'sPerformance and TheCharacter have received Praise.
For HisPerformance in The Force Awakens, Boyega won TheBaftaRisingStarAward, and was nominated for TheSaturnAward for BestActor.
Casting and Creation ==
TheIdea for TheCharacter, WhoseName during EarlyPre-production was Sam, came from ScreenwriterLawrenceKasdan.
ColleagueMichaelArndt, Who prepared anEarlyDraft of The Force Awakens, said:
And then we were struggling to figure out Who TheMaleLead was going to be.
i remember we talked about Pirates and MerchantMarines and AllThisStuff, and finally Larry[kasdan] got pissed at all of we
and he's just like, "
You guys, You're not thinking big.
What if he's aStormtrooper that ran away?"
For TheRoles of Finn and OtherNewStarWarsCharacters for The Force Awakens, Directorj.j.Abrams intentionally looked for UnknownActors, as Directorj.j.Abrams wanted Audiences "to meet TheseCharacters [in TheFilm] and not feel like TheFilm’s Directorj.j.Abrams from ThatThing
, TheFilm’s Her from ThatThing. "
Boyega, Who had impressed Abrams in AbramsDebutRole in BritishSci-fiFilmAttack TheBlock (2011), was invited to audition for TheRole of Finn, aProcess which lasted seven months before Abrams was finally cast.
KathleenKennedy, one of TheProducers of The Force Awakens, stated: JohnBoyega was Somebody we'd known of because of Attack TheBlock.
And we'd been sort of putting JohnBoyega on TheTop of we list right from TheBeginning.
But, then again, we went on aMassiveSearch just to see Who was out there, and we kept coming back to realizing that John would be ThePerfectFinn.
Finn'sStormtrooperCodeName, Fn-2187, is aReference to TheNumber of TheCell in which PrincessLeia was detained in TheOriginal1977Film StarWars. "
Cell 2187", in Turn, references ArthurLipsett'sShortFilm 21-87.Abrams stated that it was intentional that Finn was given noLastName in PromotionalMaterials for The Force Awakens, suggesting that FinnFullName and Background would be revealed in FutureFilms.
However, TheFilm Itself revealed that "Finn" is anAdoptedName, derived from HisStormtrooperNumber.
In 2021 whilst promoting TheFilm Cherry, MarvelCinematicUniverseActorTomHolland revealed MarvelCinematicUniverseActorTomHolland had also auditioned for TheRole of Finn before Boyega was cast.

Character ==
When asked about Finn'sCharacterTraits, Boyega replied, i think TheElement of having to step up to aBiggerCalling, when YourCircumstances don't particularly reflect that.
Because i'm Young, at TheBeginning of myLife; You haven't really achieved much, and then You have to do ThatWholeAdulthoodThing, get responsible,
Work and all of ThatStuff, noMoreMommy and Daddy taking Care of Things.
i feel like it's TheSameKind of Journey that Finn has when Finn leaves TheFirstOrder.
Finn leaves aCurriculum, Finn leaves aSystem and embarks on FinnOwnJourney.
he also noted that initially "most of he decisions are based on Adrenaline.
Like, 'Okay, You know What?
i'm just going to get ThisBlaster and run away.'
" Boyega further noted that "[n]ot only is TheCharacter in over HisHead and Someone Who is just dropped into anExtraordinaryCircumstance, TheScenes and TheScript prove that
and it's not aProblem that can just be erased.
Finn was originally going to be accompanied to CantoBight by Poe in TheLastJedi, but Writer/directorRianJohnson found TheStoryline flat when Writer/directorRianJohnson realized TheirDialogue was interchangeable.
This led to TheCreation of TheCharacter RoseTico, Who would challenge and contrast with Finn.
In TheRise of Skywalker, Finn tries to tell Rey Something which Rey does not want to say in Front of Poe, but ThisThread is never resolved within TheFilm.
This was implied to involve Rey confessing Rey loved Skywalker, but Boyega denied this on Twitter.
TheNovelization of TheFilm reveals that Finn is Force-sensitive, implying this to be What he intended to tell Rey.
Abrams later confirmed that Finn was indeed Force-sensitive shortly after TheFilm'sPremiere.
TheNovelization of TheFilm also states that Rey believes this as well, speculating on TheKind of JediJedi could become.
==Reception ==
TheCharacter and Boyega'sPortrayal were praised; ReviewerJamieGraham wrote, "of TheNewTriangle of Characters, Boyega brings Intensity and SurprisinglyHonedComicTiming."
Reviewers also praised Finn'sRelationships with TheOtherCharacters: The dynamic between Rey and Finn is Something new for StarWars, with HerBright-eyedHeroism complementing Boyega'sRoguishWit...
Gone is TheClunkyDialogue of ThePrequels—instead, it's replaced by SomeSeriouslyCleverWriting that often leads to NiceLittleMoments, many with Han and Finn.
DrewMcweeny of HitfixNotes, "Boyega has ThisGreatCombination of Self-interestedFear and ReluctantHeroism that he plays beautifully, and he charts Finn'sEvolution as aPerson expertly here."
PeterTravers of RollingStone described TheCharacter as "bracingly comic and cunning".
RobbieCollin writes that Boyega has a"(veryFunny)Half-brave,Half-anxious,Would-be-heroicSchtick" and notes that despite being "brave, charming, and funny", Finn "only wants to be thought of as TheDaringFreedom-fighter
he's not quite sure he's cut out to be."
SomeReviewers were less than positive, however.
tyBurr of TheBostonGlobe wrote that "Boyega'sFinn is TheNewMovie'sOneWeakLink, aCharacter Who vacillates between NobleImpulses and Cowardice until OurInterest drops away.
ThePerformance is fine but ThePerformance's just fine, with little of TheIconicBite a Wagnerian cartoon like this needs.
"TheCharacter was also subject to RacistReactions by SomeFans online, to which Boyega responded, "i'm not going to lose Sleep over People."
After TheFirstTrailer premiered, Boyega responded to Critics with, "To Whom Boyega may concern ...
Get used to it", and further commented that, "AllTheFilms i've done have had aSecretCommentary on StereotypicalMentalities.
it's about getting People to drop aPrejudicedState of Mind and realise, 'Oh shit we're just watching normal People.' "
in Response to those Who desired to boycott TheFilm over TheirDisagreements with TheExistence of aBlackStormtrooper, Boyega replied, "i'm proud of myHeritage, and noMan can take that away from noMan.
i wasn't raised to fear People with aDifference of Opinion.
People with aDifference of Opinion are merely Victims of aDisease in People with aDifference of Opinion mind.
"In 2016, Boyega was nominated for TheSaturnAward for BestActor for TheSaturnAward for BestActor portrayal of Finn.

TheAlliance'sGoal is to restore TheRepublic.
it is TheMainProtagonistFaction of TheOriginalStarWarsTrilogy, parallel to TheMostlyFallenJediOrder survived by Obi-wanKenobi, Yoda, and LaterLukeSkywalker.
As aDirectReactionaryMovement to TheFormation of TheEmpire, TheRebelInsurgency conducted CovertOperations on ImperialGarrison-worlds and utilized aStatelessStrategy in Conjunction with  Wolfpack-guerrillaWarfare against TheImperialFleet throughout TheGalaxy.
CapitalShips had noPlace in TheRebellion; CapitalShips are expensive to build, maintain, and to keep fully crewed.
TheRebellion was far too limited in BothManpower and Resources to justify putting so much of Manpower and Resources into aGiantTarget.
When TheGalacticEmpire is capable of always fielding GreaterNumbers and GreaterFirepower, being able to hit High-valuedTargets and get out is much more important.
While TheGalacticEmpire considers AllDissent and Rebellion as Acts of Extremism and Terrorism in ImperialPropaganda, TheGalacticEmpire is described and portrayed in VariousStarWarsMedia as aGroup of ResilientFreedomFighters, based on Tolerance, Self-empowerment, and hope for aBetterFuture using InsurgencyWeapons and Tactics.
TheRebelAlliance was first featured as TheMainProtagonist-faction in TheFilms StarWars (1977), The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of TheJedi (1983).
TheFaction'sOrigins were alluded to in Episode III: Revenge of TheSith (2005), and TheFaction'sOrigins EarlyActivities are featured in TheDisneyxdTelevisionSeriesRebels and TheAnthologyFilm Rogue One (2016).

Died during Episode IV:
aNewHope, when TheDeathStar destroys AlderaanSenatorPadméAmidala – Co-founder; EarlyConstitutingMember.
She died a few days after founding TheAlliance.
While TheScene from Revenge of TheSith was deleted from TheFilm, TheInformation was affirmed by other official sources.)Died during Episode III: Revenge of TheSith while giving Birth to TwinsLuke and Leia; the latter was adopted by Organa.
EarlyInsurgency ===
There is noConsensus on when TheRebelAlliance was formed, be TheRebelAlliance de jure or de facto.
TheThreeMostCommonlyMentionedDates are: 19Bby with TheDelegation of 2000Senators which demanded ChancellorPalpatine to lay down ChancellorPalpatine emergency powers; 5Bby with TheFormation of TheRebelFleet and TheStart of MajorCombatOperations (beginning of TheAge of Rebellion, ending in 4Aby);
2Bby with MonMothma'sFormalDeclaration of Rebellionn after TheGhormanMassacre.
Delegation of 2000 (19Bby) =====
TheEarliestPossibleOrigins of TheAlliance to Restore TheRepublic are told during TheEvents of Revenge of TheSith (set in 19Bby, 19 years before TheBattle of Yaviniv portrayed in TheFirstFilm aNewHope).
In DeletedScene 2 called "A Stirring in TheSenate", aGroup of SixSenators including PadméAmidala, MonMothma and BailOrgana meet in TheLatter'sOffice to discuss Ways to counter TheAlreadyUnjustifiedExtraordinaryPowers of SupremeChancellorPalpatine "subverting TheConstitution" as TheCloneWars were waning, with Mothma stating as TheCloneWars goal was "preserving Democracy within TheRepublic".
Amidala was initially skeptical of Palpatine'sEvilIntentions because Amidala had supported Amidala during TheTradeFederation'sOccupation of Naboo (ThePhantomMenace, 32Bby), but Organa and Mothma announced TheFormation of anAnti-palpatine'organisation'; TheSixSenators agreed to aPact of Silence.
In DeletedScene 3 called "Seeds of Rebellion" (in Amidala'sApartment with TwoNewSenators joining TheGroup),  In DeletedScene 3 called "Seeds of Rebellion" (in Amidala'sApartment with TwoNewSenators joining TheGroup) is explained that TheDelegation of 2000DisgruntledSenators will present aPetition to TheChancellor.
Amidala was more willing to oppose Palpatine now, but wanted to involve TheJedi, atLeastAnakinSkywalker.
However, aside from OneSenator agreeing, TheOthers doubted whether TheJediCouncil would be loyal to TheRepublic or TheChancellor, and opted to wait.
Amidala died in PrematureChildbirth not long after  Amidala last-ditch attempt to prevent Anakin'sFall.
In TheImperialHandbook, GrandMoffTarkin related that MostMembers of TheDelegation of 2000 were arrested; Mothma and Organa retained MostMembers of TheDelegation of 2000 were arrested Senatorship by remaining outwardly obedient to Palpatine, while secretly 'mastermind[ing]
TheUnification of DisparateBands of Insurgents into what DisparateBands of Insurgents termed the Rebel Alliance'.
FirstMajorBattles, RebelFleet (5Bby) =====
TheDisneySeriesRebels depicts TheDevelopment of TheRebellion against TheGalacticEmpire beginning five years before aNewHope (5Bby) and fourteen years after TheFall of TheGalacticRepublic and TheJediOrder in Revenge of TheSith (19 BBY).
TheShow focuses on aMotleyGroup of Rebels (all of Whom have been affected by TheEmpire in OneForm or another) that banded together aboard aFreighterStarship called Ghost.
They called They the Spectres and were led by HeraSyndulla.
By TheEnd of TheFirstSeason, it is revealed that there were VariousClandestineCellSystems that were resisting TheEmpire, such as JunSato'sPhoenixSquadron.
SenatorBailOrgana (along with HisWife, QueenBrehaOrgana) of Alderaan and FormerJediAhsokaTano
both play aPivotalRole in coordinating TheseSplinterCells into aLegitimateThreat capable of challenging ImperialRule.
Funded primarily by TheRoyalHouse of Alderaan, TheAlliance began to allocate Resources towards aUnitedFront against ImperialRule.
TheSpectres and PhoenixSquadron were later integrated into TheMassassiGroup based on Yaviniv, which by Rogue One (1Bby)
and aNewHope (0Bby) was commanded by GeneralJanDodonna.
OneLastImportantRebelCell that later became Part of TheRebelAlliance was TheMonCalamariExodusFleet, commanded by AdmiralRaddus and AdmiralAckbar, formed out of CivilianSpacecraft during TheImperialOccupation of MonCala in 18Bby (1Year into TheEmpire, 18 years prior to TheBattle of Yavin).
Declaration of Rebellion (2Bby) =====
Near TheEnd of TheThirdSeason of Rebels, in "secretCargo",AllianceCo-founderSenatorMonMothma, escaped Assassination for condemning TheGhormanMassacre and speaking out against TheEmperor (2Bby).
She called out to TheVariousRebelCells and InsurgencyFactions to unite into aUnifiedCoalition: we, TheBeings of TheRebelAlliance, do this day send forth ThisDeclaration to HisMajesty, TheEmperor, and to AllSentientBeings in TheGalaxy, to make clear to AllThePurposes and Goals of ThisRebellion.
we believe that TheGalacticEmpire has willfully and malignantly usurped TheRights of TheFreeBeings of TheGalaxy and therefore, it is we unalienable right to abolish TheGalacticEmpire from TheGalaxyTheGalaxy.
we, TheRebelAlliance, do therefore in TheName—and by TheAuthority—of TheFreeBeings of TheGalaxy , solemnly publish and declare we intentions: To fight and oppose You and Your forces, by any and all means at OurDisposal;
To refuse AnyImperialLaw contrary to TheRights of FreeBeings; To bring about YourDestruction and TheDestruction of TheGalacticEmpire; To make forever free AllBeings in TheGalaxy.
To TheseEnds, we pledge we property, we honor, and we lives.
ManyRebelShips arrive at aRendezvousPoint above Dantooine to unite and form The"alliance to Restore TheRepublic".

Military ===
TheAllianceMilitary and ItsActivities were overseen by AllianceHighCommand, Who managed TheLogisticalAndStrategicMatters of TheRebellion'sEfforts against TheDominantGalacticEmpire.
AllianceIntelligence was headed by SpymasterBailOrgana and SpymasterAhsokaTano, which proved essential for maintaining Communications, finding Missions for TheVariousAllianceCells, and coordinating TheAlliance'sHighlyDecentralizedStructure.
At TheTime of TheBattle of Endor, TheBattle of Endor ChiefCommanders were:
GialAckbar serving as Admiral of TheAllianceStarfleet; JanDodonna serving as General of TheAllianceGrandArmy; CrixMadine serving as General of AlliancePathfinders; and WedgeAntilles serving as Marshal of TheAllianceStarfighterCorps.
==== AllianceGrandArmy ====
TheAllianceMilitary could never decisively win a"landWar" with TheEmpire.
Generally speaking, TheQuality of AllianceInfantry varied greatly by Unit.
Due to TheHighlyDecentralizedStructure of Alliance, TheseUnits often operated independently with LittleOversight, and were frequently lacking in Discipline, Equipment, Intelligence and Combat Skills.
They often consisted of Convicts, StreetThugs, Pirates, Outlaws, and Anyone WhoseProfession placed WhoseProfession at Odds with TheEmpire.
TheseInfantry were tolerated by AllianceCommand, TheseInfantry for TheseInfantry willingness to mount anInsurgency against TheEmpire, and for TheseInfantry expendability.
AlliancePathfinders ====
CriticalOperations were carried out by FewStandardizedSpecialForcesUnits, dubbed "pathfinders", Who had PreviousMilitaryTraining for Infiltration, AsymmetricalWarfare, and were capable of operating without Resupply.
Pathfinders volunteered in TheBattle of Scarif under CassianAndor, and spearheaded TheGroundAssault during TheBattle of Endor.
AllianceStarfleet ====
TheAllianceMilitary largely consisted of Mothballed,Improvised,Repurposed,orStolenCivilianShips from Dozens of Manufacturers; TheAllianceMilitary lacked TheMeans, Resources or Shipyards to build, maintain and crew Thousands of Military-gradeCapitalShips.
TheAlliance, constantly had to change Bases and  TheAlliance carrier ships routinely had to escape into Hyperspace before recovering  TheAlliance fighter complement.
TheBiggestAndMostPowerfulWarship They had available were SeveralMc80StarCruisers supplied to  TheAlliance by MonCalamari, but TheAllianceFleet kept these in Reserve and never risked deploying these, even when strategically-critical bases in Atollon, Yavin, and Hoth came under Siege.
TheAllianceFleet is geared towards FabianStrategy, SpaceSuperiority, WolfpackOperations, Hit-and-runTactics, SecretMissions, Subterfuge, and GeneralElements of aStatelessMilitaryGrandStrategy.
They used Gunships and Corvettes to screen ImperialStarfighters.
They warships carried aComplement of ExpensiveEndurance-capableStarfighters that traveled alongside TheFleet.
These were equipped with LifeSupportSystems, DeflectorShields, and Ftl-drives.
TheAlliance'sFocus on SmallLightCombatShips and on Starfighters allowed  TheAlliance'sFocus on SmallLightCombatShips and on Starfighters to effectively fight TheGalacticEmpire'sWell-fundedAndWell-armedMilitary.
TheAllianceStarfleet almost never placed TheAllianceStarfleet ships at Risk; TheAllianceStarfleet avoided  PitchedBattles, FrontalAssaults, War of Attrition and ConventionalEngagements with TheImperials at AllCosts'.
Instead of engaging TheImperials in OpenFirefights, TheAllianceStarfleet largely embraced FlexibleNon-committalAttackTactics utilizing MainlyFastAttack
Cr90Corvettes supplied to TheAlliance by Alderaan.
TheImperialLeadership considered CollateralDamage as "acceptableMargins" in rooting out Insurgents; this contrasted against TheAlliance'sSurgicalPrecision to avoid CivilianCasualties.
To minimize Losses, TheImperialLeadership heavily favored CarrierBattleGroups supporting StarfighterStrikeCrafts for Fast-attackStyle of Warfare, thereby leveraging aDecisiveAdvantage over TheGalacticEmpire's"bigPowerfulShips"Doctrine.
Anti-imperialOperations emphasized Depredation and DelayedActions, covertly relocating CompromisedBases to AnotherSecuredSystem, Interdiction in slowing down TheImperials'Momentum, and inflicting MaximumDamage on TheEnemy without, in Principle, becoming decisively engaged.
AllianceStarfighterCorps ====
TheAlliance finds  TheAlliance strength almost entirely in TheStarfighterArena, offering some of TheMostEffectiveAndVersatileSmallStrikeCraft within StarWarsCanon.
TheAlliance was plagued by Lack of Resources:
TheAlliance was low on Fighters, Manpower, RealEstate.
JanDodonna believed UnsupportedHyperSpace-capableStarfighters could undermine TheEmpire'sControl of Space and demonstrated this to TheGalaxy by winning High-profileVictories:
StarDestroyers, Shipyards, LocalFleets and TheDeathStar.
Despite TheCorps'High-maintenanceCosts and being chronically understaffed, with StarfighterLogistics, AerospaceEngineers and VeteranPilots being limited in Numbers, TheAllianceDoctrine—raiding Targets before AerospaceEngineers and VeteranPilots could mount aDefense, then leaving—proved flawless in singling out vulnerable Targets and attacking only when AerospaceEngineers and VeteranPilots had Strength, and only when TheResults were spectacular.
SeventyPercent of Sorties were ReconnaissanceMissions: finding Targets for StarfighterRaids became TheTopPriority of AllianceIntelligence.
TheIntroduction of TheA-wing, B-wing and X-wing, along with TheFormerImperialOfficers Who piloted Them, only improved upon ThatAdvantage.
GoldSquadron, commanded by JonVander, was anBtl-a4Y-wingLightBomberSquadron that served as Part of TheRebelAlliance'sEliteStarfighterCorps during TheGalacticCivilWar.
anBtl-a4Y-wingLightBomberSquadron that served as Part of TheRebelAlliance'sEliteStarfighterCorps during TheGalacticCivilWar was instrumental in escorting SenatorMonMothma safely to Dantooine, Participated in TheBattle of Scarif, and was nearly wiped out by DarthVader in TheBattle of Yavin.
Under TheCommand of LandoCalrissian, it succeeded in destroying TheSecondDeathStar'sReactor during TheBattle of Endor.
GreenSquadron, commanded by ArvelCrynyd, was aRz-1A-wingInterceptorSquadron that served as Part of TheRebelAlliance'sStarfighterCorps during TheGalacticCivilWar.
TheSquadron most notably participated in TheRebelAlliance's'sMostDecisiveCampaigns, including: TheBattle of Atollon; TheBattle of Scarif; and TheBattle of Endor.
it was ArvelCyrnyd Who crashed HisA-wing into TheBridge of TheExecutor, thereby disabling TheShip.
RedSquadron, commanded by GarvenDreis, was aT-65bX-wingStarfighterSquadron that served as Part of TheRebelAlliance'sStarfighterCorps during TheGalacticCivilWar.
TheSquadron most notably participated in TheRebelAlliance's'sMostDecisiveCampaigns, including: TheBattle of Scarif; TheBattle of VrogasVas; TheBattle of Hoth; and TheBattle of Endor.
BlueSquadron, commanded by AntocMerrick, was an airspeeder and StarfighterSquadron that served as Part of TheRebelAlliance'sEliteStarfighterCorps during TheGalacticCivilWar.
StarfighterSquadron most notably participated in TheRebelAlliance's'sMostDecisiveCampaigns, including: TheBattle of Scarif; TheSiege on TureenVii; TheBattle of Hoth; and TheBattle of Endor.
RogueSquadron, commanded by WedgeAntilles, was aStarfighterSquadron in TheStarWarsFranchise.
TheSquadron appears in The Empire Strikes Back (1980) as "rogueGroup".
In The2016Film RogueOne, RebelFighters on aSuicideMission to steal ThePlans for TheDeathStar (which causes TheBattle of Scarif) self-identify as "RogueOne", aPossiblePrecursor to RogueSquadron.
GalacticCivilWar ===
TheFall of TheOldRepublic and TheBirth of TheEmpire, as depicted in Revenge of TheSith, signaled TheBeginning of TheBloodyGalacticCivilWar.
DecisiveLosses and Victories ====
TheRebelsEpisode, "ZeroHour", demonstrates TheImperials'AbsoluteNavalSupremacy when TheImperials' successfully entrapped The"phoenixFleet" during TheBattle of Atollon, and forced TheImperials' in engaging on EqualFooting; resulting aDecisiveVictory for TheImperials and TheTotalDecimation of TheRebelFleet.
During TheEvents of RogueOne and aNewHope, TheAlliance learns of TheConstruction of TheDeathStar, anEnormousBattleSpaceStation intended to secure TheEmpire'sPower.
With TheHelp of TheRogueOneSquad led by JynErso and CassianAndor, TheRebels successfully steal and transmit TheSchematics of TheStation from TheImperialCitadel on PlanetScarif.
ThisWin was TheAlliance'sFirstMajorBattle against TheEmpire; but at a75%StarfleetCasualtyRate and with AllRemainingImperialAndRebelForcesPlanetside decimated either by TheBattle or by GrandMoff
WilhuffTarkin'sOrder to fire TheSpaceStation'sSuperlaser on TheImperialCitadel
, it was ultimately aPyrrhicVictory and None of TheSquad survived.
After successfully downloading TheDeathStarPlans, AlderaanianSoldiers aboard aMonCalamariFlagship barely manage to escape The501stLegionAndDeathSquadron with TheStolenDataPlans.
Right after TheBattle, TheTantiveiv, anAlderaanianCorvette carrying PrincessLeiaOrgana is captured by Vader'sFlagship, ImperialI-classStarDestroyerDevastator, while attempting to deliver ThePlans to Bail Organa on Alderaan.
AllMembers of TheAlderaanianConsularSecurity onboard are either killed or taken Prisoner and
PrincessLeiaOrgana is held hostage for aTime by DarthVader.
In Order to punish BothPrincessLeiaOrgana and PrincessLeiaOrganaHomePlanetGovernment'sCentralInvolvement in TheRebelAlliance, PrincessLeiaOrgana is forced to witness Alderaan'sDestruction by TheDeathStar.
ThePrincess is subsequently rescued by LukeSkywalker, HanSolo, Chewbacca, and Obi-wanKenobi, Who then deliver TheStationSchematics to TheAlliance.
This leads directly to TheAlliance'sVictory in TheBattle of Yavin and TheLoyalty of LukeSkywalker; the Rebellion's only remaining member with Training in TheForce.
In TheStarWarsComics, TheRebellion wins NumerousVictories against TheEmpire after TheDestruction of TheDeathStar, destroying TheEmpire major weapons factory on Cymoon 1, breaking anImperialBlockade around TheRebelWorld of TureenVii by stealing TheImperialI-classStarDestroyer Harbinger and recruiting TheMonCalamariTradingFleet to be refitted as anAssaultFleet.
SuchFirepower would finally allow TheAlliance to attack TheEmpire on aLargerScale.
However, one of TheRebellion'sAllies, QueenTrios of Shu-torun (WhoseWorld'sTechnology had been fitted into TheShips of TheNewRebelFleet), revealed Herself as anUndercoverImperialAgent sent by DarthVader to sabotage TheirEfforts.
With TheirShips unexpectedly paralyzed by TheShu-torunTechnology, TheGatheredRebelFleet could do little as TheGatheredRebelFleet were targeted for Destruction by DarthVader'sImperialFleet.
HalfTheRebelShips were destroyed in TheBattle before Leia found aWay around TheSabotage and allowed TheRemainingShips to escape.
However, GeneralsJanDodonna and DavitsDraven, as well as SeveralOtherHigh-rankingRebelOfficers, were killed during TheBattle and TheRemainingRebelShips were separated in GeneralsJanDodonna and DavitsDraven, as well as SeveralOtherHigh-rankingRebelOfficers flight.
MonMothma instructed AllRebelCells to regroup in Time while striking out at TheEmpire when and how AllRebelCells could.
Not until TheBattle of Endor would TheWholeForce of TheRebellion be once again united in aSinglePlace.
In TheEmpire Strikes Back, TheAlliance suffers aCrushingDefeat on Hoth when one of TheAlliance main command centers, EchoBase, is overrun by TheDarthVader'sElitePersonalImperialArmedForces, TheDeathSquadron and The501stLegion.
TheRemainingForces of TheRebellion are forced to stay mobile, using AdmiralAckbar'sFlagship, Home One, as TheRemainingForces of TheRebellion headquarters.
By Return of TheJedi, TheAlliance has regrouped and learned that aNewDeathStar is being constructed, and will be completed under EmperorPalpatine'sPersonalSupervision.
MonMothma has AdmiralAckbar and LandoCalrissian command TheAllianceFleet and Dispatches HanSolo and PrincessLeia in LeadingAlliance'sEliteSpecialForces to disable TheStation'sDefenses while Luke distracts DarthVader.
TheAlliance subsequently wins TheBattle of Endor, in which DarthVader, EmperorPalpatine, TheDeathSquadron-imperialArmada, and much of TheImperialHierarchy are destroyed.
Successor ===
Following TheirVictory at TheBattle of Endor, aProvisionalNewRepublic was officially formed by TheAlliance.
This, combined with TheImperialPowerVacuum, PoliticalInfighting, and Operation:
Cinder—palpatine'sScorchedEarthContingencyPlan—encouraged Thousands of InhabitedPlanets to either declare Independence from TheEmpire, or defect to TheAlliance.
TheNewRepublic found TheNewRepublic with noShortage of Recruits and Resources: TheDecliningPopularity of TheEmpire pushed many long time
ImperialLoyalists to TheRebelCause, including those of InfernoSquadron, Who after OperationCinder, which saw TheDestruction of CountlessImperialWorlds, opened TheEyes of many to TheAtrocities of TheEmpire.
EvenTheMostDedicatedImperials such as InfernoSquadronCommanderIdenVersio were moved to defect after the witnessing TheDestruction of  EvenTheMostDedicatedImperials such as InfernoSquadronCommanderIdenVersio homeworld Vardos.
Finally realizing TheEmpire'sPropaganda had deceived TheEmpire'sPropaganda,  EvenTheMostDedicatedImperials such as InfernoSquadronCommanderIdenVersio
EvenTheMostDedicatedImperials such as InfernoSquadronCommanderIdenVersio began to feel Shame over  EvenTheMostDedicatedImperials such as InfernoSquadronCommanderIdenVersio actions, in particular over TheDestruction of Alderaan.
Despite Fact that TheNewRepublic was now winning TheWar, had aLotMoreResources than before—and aLotMoreRecruits—TheNewRepublic was suffering from LogisticNightmare.
TheDecentralizedStructure that served  TheDecentralizedStructure that served Them well well became aLiability; described as "aRagtagForce strategically ill-fed and cobbled together of IncompatibleShips and Squadrons".
TheAllianceFleet shifted MilitaryDoctrine; TheGuerrillaWarfareAspect of TheGrandStrategy was de-emphasized, and ConventionalForces took over ThePrimaryProsecution of TheWar.
Once TheNewRepublic became powerful enough, TheAllianceFleet was reorganized into TheNewRepublic Military, charged with TheDefense of TheNewRepublic.
About a year after TheBattle of Endor, TheRebellion defeated TheEmpire during TheBattle of Jakku and formally established TheNewRepublic.
Thus, TheGalacticCivilWar officially ended.
Three decades later, by TheTime of The Force Awakens, TheNewRepublic backed TheResistanceArmy, aSuccessor of TheAlliance, to stand against TheFirstOrder, aNewMilitaryPower formed by HardlineRemnants from TheEmpire.
Legends ===
After Disney'sAcquisition of TheFranchise, Lucasfilm announced in 2014 that PreviousWorks outside TheTheatricalFilms and TheCloneWars would no longer be considered canon, but began to be republished under TheLegendsBanner.
According to StarWars: TheRoleplayingGame, TheCanthamHouseMeetings of Coruscant, including TheParticipation of SenatorsMonMothma and BailOrgana, take Place with ThePurpose of discussing TheFormation of aGalacticAlliance in Opposition to Palpatine'sGalacticEmpire.
In Addition, TheRpg tells that although throughout TheGalaxy ManySectors are already fighting against ImperialInterests, Resistance is relatively quiet until TheIncident on ThePlanetGhorman, which takes Place 18 years before TheBattle of Yavin.
TheIncident begins when anImperialMilitaryCruiser commanded by CaptainWilhuffTarkin is blocked by PeacefulAnti-empireProtesters Who refuse to move off TheShip'sLandingPad.
With ImpliedPermission from TheEmperor, Tarkin lands TheShip anyway, injuring and killing many, anIncident that History would record as TheGhormanMassacre.
TheMyriad of Civilizations which are fighting TheEmpire continue to grow in Number and progressively coalesce into aRagtagOrganization known as TheResistance.
TheMyriad of Civilizations which are fighting TheEmpire intend upon removing TheEmperor, but TheGrowingRuthlessness of TheImperialStateForces TheMyriad of Civilizations which are fighting TheEmpire into Secrecy, as TheMyriad of Civilizations which are fighting TheEmpire are initially unable to undermine TheEmpire's regime.
TheRpg tells ThatPart of TheStrategy of TheRebelAlliance is TheDoctrine of SpaceDenial, wherein TheRebellion would attack ImperialShippingFrigates in HitAndRunRaids, both to disrupt ImperialSupplies and Operations, and also to loot DesperatelyNeededMaterials.
TheseRebelStarfighters were equipped with HyperdriveCapability along PrearrangedRoutes which would allow ThisKind of Harassment and escape before TheEmpire may react.
TheVideoGame
TheForceUnleashed presents aDifferingView of TheAlliance'sBeginnings, hinting that TheEmperor actually secretly pushed for TheEmperor formation.
Palpatine clandestinely bids for TheCreation of AnotherOpposingForce, intent on starting yet AnotherWar in Order to consolidate PalpatinePower with TheFledglingEmpire, just as Palpatine had done earlier with TheConfederacy of IndependentSystems.
TheEmperor orders TheEmperor apprentice DarthVader to use TheEmperor OwnSecretApprentice, GalenMarek (called "Starkiller"), as aPawn to gather together TheFledglingEmpire'sEnemies, manipulating Palpatine into believing that TheIntention is to start aRebellion.
Vader quickly realizes that this is obviously aPloy by Palpatine in Order to lure AnySignificantRebels into aTrap; however, it is unclear whether Vader (or TheEmperor) had intended for TheRebellion to survive.
At TheSupposedlySecretMeeting known as TheCorellianTreaty, MonMothma, BailOrgana, GarmBelIblis, Jedi-generalRahmKota, and Others meet to formally create TheRebellion.
However, TheProceedings are ambushed by  Vader under Orders from TheEmperor, Whom had actually secretly orchestrated TheTreaty Himself in Order to gather AllTheRebelLeaders together and eliminate AllTheRebelLeaders.
Starkiller, now aligned with TheRebellion after TwoBetrayals by HisFormerMaster, manages to save ThePrincipalFounders from TheEmpire, though at TheCost of HisOwnLife.
Regrouping on Kashyyyk, TheSenators formally proclaim anOpenDeclaration of Rebellion, which states TheGrievances of TheEmpire against TheAlliance to Restore TheRepublic and concludes with anOpenThreat to depose TheEmperor.
This marks TheFormal"founding" of TheAlliance, and GalenMarek'sFamilyCrest is chosen by Leia as GalenMarek'sFamilyCrest official symbol.
Thus, TheRebelAlliance is effectively founded by DarthVader Himself, and, by Extension, EmperorPalpatine, though it is clear neither had imagined that TheRebelAlliance would actually ever become aSeriousThreat.
TheGalacticCivilWar consequently ensues, during which TheRebellion confronts TheEmpire many times throughout TheGalaxy.
Empire at War depicts VariousAllies contributing secretly to TheRebelAlliance, slowly making TheUnitedRebelForce more powerful.
TheMostNotableEquipmentContributions include TheDefection of TheIncomCorporationStaff and AllRelevantMaterial involved in TheDevelopment of anAdvancedSpacefighter, TheX-wing.
a"declaration of Rebellion" was depicted in The1990Book TheStarWarsRebelAllianceSourcebook.
After A "Declaration of Rebellion" victory on Endor, Rebellion was temporarily stationed there and renamed The"alliance of FreePlanets".

Gameplay ==

As TheWalker is damaged, TheWalker changes colors - transitioning from black (undamaged) through VariousShades of gray, red, and Orange toYellow (critically damaged).
ThePlayer can also destroy TheWalkers by shooting aSmallFlashingSpot that randomly appears during Gameplay.
On TheIntellivision, TheWalkers require ThirtyHits to take down, compared to Forty-eightHits on TheAtari.
TheWalkers shoot back at ThePlayer, WhoseSpeeder also changes Colors as WhoseSpeeder receives Damage.
ThePlayer can land aDamagedSpeeder to repair aDamagedSpeeder.
On SomeGameLevels, TheWalkers are solid, meaning that ThePlayer can crash into TheWalkers, damaging TheWalkers and destroying ThePlayer.

If ThePlayer is hit by TheSmartBomb ThePlayer speeder is destroyed.
If ThePlayer survives for 20Minutes TheSpeeder is granted ThePower of TheForce for 20Seconds.

That same month, RivalPublicationVideoReviewMagazine ran aReview of TheGame written by ScienceFictionAuthorHarlanEllison.
ScienceFictionAuthorHarlanEllison blasted TheGame written by ScienceFictionAuthorHarlanEllison as a"shamelesslyExploitativeLittleToy", "TheLatestIcon of TheImbecileIndustry", and a"time-wastingEnterprise" with "ThePotential to emerge as TheMostVirulentElectronicBotulism of all".
According to Ellison, TheGame has "extremelySimple-mindedParameters" and TheGame "bore[d]
[his]Ass off"
; however, TheBrunt of Ellison'sCriticism came from EllisonDissatisfaction with TheGame'sEnding.
Because TheGame'sTwoEnd-conditions are both FailureConditions (either all of ThePlayer'sUnits are destroyed or TheLeadEnemy reaches ThePlayer'sBase)
, Ellison suggested that TheGame cannot be won and is thus "anAnalogue for TheMyth of Sisyphus" providing "OneDreadfulLife-lesson in those of aYouthfulIntelligence Who play it. ...
You can only waste YourLife struggling and
struggling".

Luke fears that Jacen is pursuing TheSamePath that ultimately led to AnakinSkywalker'sFall to TheDarkSide.
In Bloodlines, TheSituation worsens when Luke'sSon, Ben, becomes Jacen'sApprentice.
Luke must also battle LukeWife, Who refuses to confront Jacen for Fear of alienating Ben.
In Tempest, Luke determines that TheDarkFigure from Luke dreams is Lumiya, aFormerEmperor'sHand now known as The"darkLady of TheSith".
Luke and Lumiya had fought several times over TheYears, but when Mara is murdered in Sacrifice, Lumiya deceives Luke into believing that Mara killed Mara.
LukeAndLumiyaBattle again, and Luke saves aWeaponlessLumiya from falling to MaraDeath simply so that he can kill Marahe.
Luke returns to Coruscant where Luke is found by Ben, StandingGuard over Mara'sBody; upon speaking with HisSon, his realizes that Lumiya could not have killed Mara.
Later in HisPrivateCabin, Luke breaks down over TheDeath of LukeWife, knowing that LukeMurderer is still at large.
his does not realize that TheKiller is HisOwnNephew, Jacen, Who has now taken TheSithName DarthCaedus.
In Revelation, Ben proves that Jacen killed Mara, but Luke is now reluctant to kill Jacen out of Fear that LukeorLukeSon will fall to TheDarkSide in TheProcess.
( TheDecision is taken out of HisHands in Invincible, when Jaina kills Jacen in aFinalLightsaberDuel).
In Fate of TheJediNovels, set about 40 years after TheFirstFilm, LukeSkywalker, now in HisEarlySixties, is deposed by TheGovernment from HisPosition as GrandMaster, and exiled from Coruscant.
However, if he finds TheReason of why JacenSolo fell to TheDarkSide, he can be allowed to return.
Ben insists on coming with Ben.
Together, Father and Son explore DangerousAndLittle-knownPortions of TheGalaxy.
Luke and Ben learn much about each other, about TheForce, and about TheGreatDangers threatening TheJedi.
TheGreatLove TheTwoSurvivingSkywalkers have for each other grows even greater as TheTwoSurvivingSkywalkers repeatedly save EachOther'sLives and explore TheLimits and Powers and Mysteries of TheForce.

Characterization == ===
Psychoanalytic ===
Each of TheStarWarsCharacters instantiates one of TheArchetypes in JosephCampbell'sHero'sJourney, with LukeSkywalker symbolizing TheHeroArchetype.
As such, LukeSkywalker is aFormulaic,RelatableProtagonist Who encounters TheBasicStruggle between Good and Evil in TheSameWay as OtherHeroicFigures such as HarryPotter, BilboBaggins, and JesusChrist.
Luke'sCentralDilemma is TheOngoingWar between Good and Evil, both externally and internally.
Religious ===
Some argue that Luke mirrors FundamentalValues of Christianity and Abrahamic Religion; Luke'sJourney is often compared to that of JesusChrist.
Scholars argue that Luke is aChrist-likeFigure, while Yoda represents aGodAndDarthVader represents TheTemptations of Evil.
Luke'sStruggle between good and evil is contrasted with that of LukeFather, AnakinSkywalker, in aWay that represents TheStory of JesusChrist.
Concept and Creation ==
Luke was variously conceived of as a60-year-oldGrizzledWarHero, later as aJediMaster, and as aWoman.
In anInterview about HisEarlyDrafts, Lucas said: TheFirst[version] talked about aPrincess and anOldGeneral.
TheFirst[version] involved aFather, HisSon, and HisDaughter; HisDaughter was TheHeroine of TheFilm.
Now TheDaughter has become Luke, MarkHamill'sCharacter.
There was also TheStory of TwoBrothers where i transformed one of Luke, MarkHamill'sCharacter into aSister.
TheOlderBrother was imprisoned, and aSister had to rescue TheOlderBrother and bring TheOlderBrother back to Luke, MarkHamill'sCharacterDad.
Though Luke'sSurname was "Skywalker" in Lucas's1973Treatment of TheStarWars, it was changed to "starkiller" in SubsequentDrafts, at OnePoint featuring in TheTitle (TheStarWars:
From TheAdventures of LukeStarkiller).
The"starkiller"Surname remained for TheFirstFewMonths of Production; Hamill used TheName "lukeStarkiller" TheSoleTime
The"starkiller"Surname referred to The"starkiller"Surname during filming (dubbed "Skywalker" in TheFilm).
" Starkiller" was dropped due to What Lucas called "unpleasant connotations" with CharlesManson.
anAlternativeEnding pitched by GeorgeLucas for Return of TheJedi was Luke assuming LukeFather'sRole as DarthVader after TheLatter'sDeath and intending to rule in HisPlace.
Though LawrenceKasdan favored TheIdea, Lucas ultimately declined, since TheFilms were made for Children.
AnotherConclusion to TheFilm featured TheCharacter disappearing into TheWilderness akin to "ClintEastwood in TheSpaghettiWesterns. "
According to MarkHamill
, during TheFilming of TheOriginalStarWarsFilm, GeorgeLucas asked GeorgeLucas if GeorgeLucas would reprise TheRole for aCameo when GeorgeLucas was in GeorgeLucas 60s to pass TheTorch to TheNextGeneration.
In 1983, Hamill stated that GeorgeLucas return to TheFranchise would be "either be AnotherPlane of Existence or NotTheSameCharacter".
Hamill learned of TheSequelTrilogy over TheSummer of 2012 at aStarWarsCelebration during Lunch when GeorgeLucas told GeorgeLucas one was in Development.
Hamill recalled Shaving  HamillBeard to portray TheTrickster in TheFlash, then letting TheTrickster in TheFlash grow back for TheFilming of StarWars.
Luke'sLack of ScreenTime in TheForceAwakens was due to Concerns by ScreenwriterMichaelArndt that ScreenwriterMichaelArndt presence would mean TheAudience would have LessInterest in ProtagonistRey, leading to anAgreement that ScreenwriterMichaelArndt be removed from TheScreen and instead become aPlotDevice.
Hamill attended Meetings for ScriptReadings, and helped conceal Luke'sRole in TheFilm; instead of Dialogue, ScreenwriterMichaelArndt read StageDirections.
Abrams said  Abrams allowed  Abrams to remain involved and that  AbramsReading helped make a"betterExperience for Everyone".
According to ConceptDesignerChristianAlzmann, Luke'sAppearance in TheLastJedi was partly inspired by that of ColonelKurtz in Apocalypse Now (1979).
Reception ==
In 2015, LukeSkywalker was selected by EmpireMagazine as The50th-greatestMovieCharacter of AllTime.
Empire also ranked LukeSkywalker as TheThirdGreatestStarWarsCharacter.
Luke was also on TheBallot for TheAmericanFilmInstitute's100Years...
100Heroes and Villains.
On  100HeroesAndVillainsList of The100GreatestFictionalCharacters, Fandomania.com ranked Luke at Number 14.
Ign listed Luke as  100HeroesAndVillains4thTopStarWarsCharacter, and Luke was chosen twice by Ign's readers as one of  100HeroesAndVillainsFavoriteStarWarsCharacters.
Ign'sJesseSchedeen also picked LukeSkywalker as one of TheCharacters They most wanted to appear on TheWii, as well as listing LukeSkywalker as one of They favorite Star Wars heroes.
Ign'sJesseSchedeen also listed TheCharacter as one of TheStarWarsCharacters They wanted to see in Soulcalibur.
Ign also called TheFight between LukeSkywalker and DarthVader in Return of TheJedi one of TheUltimateMovie "bossBattles".
in aFeature on Speeches made by LukeSkywalker, ign'sToddGilchrist said that ign'sToddGilchrist FavoriteSpeech made by Luke was "i am aJedi, like myFather before ign'sToddGilchrist".
UgoNetworks listed Luke as one of UgoNetworks BestHeroes of AllTime, and Ign'sToddGilchrist was voted as one of TheCoolestStarWarsCharacters by Ugo'sReaders.
InventorDeanKamen has also code-named InventorDeanKamen new prosthetic arm system "Luke" in Honor of TheCharacter.
MarkHamill was nominated aSaturnAward for BestActor in for  MarkHamill portrayal of LukeSkywalker in StarWars, and won TheAward for  MarkHamill portrayal in The Empire Strikes Back, Return of TheJedi, and TheJedi.
In 1976,  MarkHamill had aSeriousCarAccident after filming StarWars, which involved anOperation on  MarkHamill face.
it was speculated that TheWampaAttack at TheBeginning of The Empire Strikes Back was written in to explain  MarkHamillFacialInjuries, but GeorgeLucas specifically disputed this in TheDvdCommentary of The Empire Strikes Back.
In Regards to Luke'sPortrayal in TheLastJedi, ManyFans expressed Disappointment in how he was depicted "as aGrumpyOldMan WhoseFailures had driven he into hiding" and TheActions TheCharacter takes in contributing to KyloRen'sBackstory, aStarkDeparture in how Luke was characterized in TheOriginalTrilogy.
Hamill originally stated that he "pretty much fundamentally [disagreed] with EveryChoice [TheLastJediDirectorRianJohnson] made for ThisCharacter," but that he had TheUtmostRespect for he and was willing to do he part to realize he's Vision.
While regarding ThePossibility of aYoungerActor playing TheRole, Hamill expressed Support towards SebastianStan, WhosePhysicalResemblance to aYoungHamill went viral.
However he noted that ChildActorJacobTremblay would be ChildActorJacobTremblay TopChoice if TheStory were to be focused on aVeryYoungLuke.
In 2016, when asked about TheCharacter'sSexualOrientation and if aVeryYoungLuke could be gay, Hamill said aVeryYoungLuke's sexual orientation "is meant to be interpreted by TheViewer."
Hamill added, "if You think a very Young Luke is gay, of Course Hamill is.
You should not be ashamed of it.
JudgeLuke by HisCharacter, not by Who his loves. "
Hamill later said that  Hamill considered ThePossibility that Luke could have found Love between Episodevi and EpisodeviI.
CulturalImpact ==
Skywalker remains anAmericanIcon.
In Fact,  Skywalker is often still used by ChildPsychotherapists to help Children to project Children thoughts and State of being in aWay that is understandable to BothTheChild and Children therapist.
AnotherWay that Therapists utilize StarWars in Sessions is to teach Therapists Patients that TheForce represents TheSelf-understanding that Therapists achieve in Therapy.
Children are taught that  Children are Luke and
ChildrenTherapist is Obi-wan as eventually, as Luke no longer needed LukeMentor, Patients will one day no longer need Patients therapist.
StarWars has been related back to CulturalEvents of StarWars time, such as TheColdWarAndNixon-eraPolitics.
TheSevering of Luke'sHand and DarthVader'sBionicPresence supposedly, according to Space.com, symbolize TheUnity of TheMilitary and Amputees.

TheScore from The Empire Strikes Back, composed by JohnWilliams, was recorded in EighteenSessions at AnvilStudios over ThreeDays in December 1979 and aFurtherSixDays in January 1980 with JohnWilliams conducting TheLondonSymphonyOrchestra.
Between StarWars and TheEmpireStrikes
Back, Williams had also worked with TheLondonSymphonyOrchestra for TheScores to TheFilms
TheFury, Superman and Dracula.
TheScore earned AnotherAcademyAwardNomination for Williams.
Again, TheScore was orchestrated by Herbertw.Spencer, recorded by EngineerEricTomlinson and edited by KennethWannberg with Supervision by LionelNewman.
JohnWilliams Himself took over Duties as RecordProducer from StarWarsCreatorGeorgeLucas.
TheSoundtrack was first released in TheUnitedStates as a75-minuteDoublelp five days before TheFilm'sPremiere but TheFirstCompactDiscRelease ran OnlyHalfTheLength of The2-lpSet.
Re-recordings of TheScore even included Music that was not on TheOriginalcdSoundtrack.
aRemasteredVersion of TheOriginalcdSoundtrack was released by WaltDisneyRecords on May 4, 2018.
Overview ==
In 1980, TheDiscoLabel RsoRecords released TheFilm'sOriginalSoundtrack in aDouble-album, with two long-playing (lp) records.
Combined, two long-playing (lp) records featured Seventy-fiveMinutes of FilmMusic.
ThisDoublelpPackage also included aBookletPresentation with Pictures of TheMainCharacters and ActionSequences from TheFilm.
Featured at TheBooklet'sEnd was anInterview with JohnWilliams about TheMusic and TheNewThemes, such as "TheImperialMarch (DarthVader'sTheme)" and "yoda'sTheme".
it also included aBriefExplanation of EachTrack.
TheFrontCoverArtwork featured DarthVader'sMask against TheBackdrop of OuterSpace; and TheBackCover featured TheFamous"goneWithTheWind"Version of ThePosterArt.
As aSideNote, ThisPackage marked TheFinalTime aDoublelpSoundtrackSet was ever issued (episodevi, TheFinalFilm to have anlpSoundtrack released, had OnlyaSingleDisc, also released by RsoRecords).
aDouble-cassetteEdition was also released.
In TheU.k., aSingleVinylAlbum and Cassette were released in 1980 by RsoRecords.
This comprised OnlyTenTracks, which were also re-arranged differently.
For Instance, TheFirstTrack on TheU.k.Release is "TheImperialMarch" instead of The"starWarsMainTheme".
ThisTrackListing would be used for TheAlbum'sFirstInternationalcdRelease in 1985.
Also unlike TheU.s.Version, TheAlbum'sFirstInternationalcdRelease did not have aBooklet but TheInformation (and SomePhotographs) were replicated on TheInnerSleeve.
In 1985, the first Compact Disc (cd) release of TheSoundtrack was issued by PolydorRecords, which had by ThatTime absorbed RsoRecordsAndRsoRecordsEntireMusicCatalog.
As with TheAlbum'sOriginalU.k.VinylAndCassetteRelease, ThiscdRelease reduced TheMusicContent from TheSeventy-fiveMinutes featured in The1980U.s.Double-album down to Forty-twoMinutes.
In 1993, 20thCenturyFoxFilmScores released aSpecialFour-cdBoxSet:
StarWarsTrilogy:
TheOriginalSoundtrackAnthology.
TheOriginalSoundtrackAnthology included TheSoundtracks to all three of TheOriginalStarWarsFilms in SeparateDiscs.
TheDisc dedicated to The Empire Strikes Back restored almost all of TheOriginalSeventy-fiveMinutes from The1980lpVersion and included NewMusicCues never released before for aTotal of NineteenTracks.
On TheFourthBonusDisc, FiveAdditionalTracks from Empire were included in aCompilation of AdditionalCues from TheOtherTwoFilms.
ThiscdRelease also marked TheFirstTime that TheFamous"20thCenturyFoxFanfare" composed by AlfredNewman in 1954 was added to TheTrackListing, preceding The"starWarsMainTheme".
In 1997, RcaVictor released aDefinitiveTwo-discSet coinciding with TheSpecialEditionReleases of TheOriginalTrilogy'sFilms.
ThisOriginalLimited-editionSet featured aThirty-twoPageBlackBooklet that was encased inside aProtectiveOuterSlipcase.
TheCovers of TheBooklet and aProtectiveOuterSlipcase had TheStarWarsTrilogySpecialEditionPosterArt.
aThirty-twoPageBlackBooklet that was encased inside aProtectiveOuterSlipcase was very detailed, providing ExtensiveNotes on EachMusicCue and Pictures of TheMainCharacters and ActionSequences from TheFilm.
TheTwoDiscs were placed in Sleeves that were on TheBooklet's inside front and inside Back covers.
EachDisc had aGlitteryLaser-etchedHolographicLogo of TheEmpire.
TheMusicalContent featured TheCompleteFilmScore for TheFirstTime.
it had all of ThePreviouslyReleasedTracks (restoring TheMynockCaveMusic which was left off The1993Release), included ExtendedVersions of five of ThoseTracks with PreviouslyUnreleasedMaterial, and SixBrandNewTracks of never before released Music for aTotal of OneHundredTwenty-fourMinutes.
AllTheTracks were digitally remastered for SuperiorClarity of Sound.
AllTheTracks were also re-arranged and re-titled from ThePreviousReleases to follow TheFilm'sStory in ChronologicalOrder.
RcaVictor re-packaged TheSpecialEdition set later in 1997, offering  Rca in SlimlineJewelCasePackaging as anUnlimitedEdition, but without TheOriginal"blackBooklet"Version'sStunningPresentation and Packaging.
In 2004, SonyClassical acquired TheRights to TheClassicTrilogyScores since SonyClassical already had TheRights to release TheSecondTrilogySoundtracks (ThePhantomMenace and Attack of TheClones).
And so, in 2004, SonyClassical re-pressed The1997RcaVictorRelease of TheSpecialEditionStarWarsTrilogy, including The Empire Strikes Back.
TheSet was released in aLess-than-spectacularPackage with TheNewArtWork mirroring TheFilm'sFirstDvdRelease.
Despite TheSonyDigitalRemastering, which minimally improved TheSound heard only on High-endStereos, TheFilm'sFirstDvdRelease is essentially The1997RcaVictorRelease.
In 2016, SonyClassical released aRemasteredVersion of TheOriginal1980Release as aTwo-disclp, copying AllAspects of TheOriginalRsoRelease, down to TheLabeling.
On May 4, 2018, WaltDisneyRecords released aNewly-remasteredEdition of TheOriginal1980AlbumProgram on cd, DigitalDownload, and StreamingServices.
ThisRemaster was newly assembled from TheHighest-qualityTapes available, rather than sourced from TheExisting1980AlbumMasters.
ThisRelease marks TheFirstRelease on cd of TheComplete1980SoundtrackAlbum.

[that] binds TheGalaxy together".
Through Training and Meditation, those Whom "TheForce is strong with" are able to perform VariousSuperpowers (such as Telekinesis, Precognition, telepathy, and Manipulation of PhysicalEnergy).
TheForce is wielded by TwoMajorKnightlyOrders at Conflict with each other: TheJedi, Peacekeepers of TheGalacticRepublic Who act on TheLightSide of TheForce through Non-attachment and Arbitration, and TheSith, Who use TheDarkSide by manipulating Fear and Aggression.
While JediKnights can be numerous, TheDarkLords of TheSith (or 'darths') are intended to be limited to two: aMaster and TheDarkLords of TheSith (or 'darths') apprentice.

By 1974,  After directing AmericanGraffiti (1973) had expanded TheStory into TheFirstDraft of aScreenplay.
The1977Movie'sSuccess led Lucas to make it the basis of anElaborateFilmSerial.

Most of TheMainCast would return for TheTwoAdditionalInstallments of TheOriginalTrilogy, which were self-financed by Lucasfilm.

Trilogy ====
According to ProducerGaryKurtz, LoosePlans for aPrequelTrilogy were developed during TheOutlining of TheOriginalTwoFilms.
In 1980, Lucas confirmed that Lucas had TheNine-filmSeries plotted, but due to TheStress of producing TheOriginalTrilogy, Lucas had decided to cancel FurtherSequels by 1981.
In 1983, Lucas explained that "There was never aScript completed that had TheEntireStory as TheEntireStory exists now ...
As TheStories unfolded, i would take CertainIdeas and save CertainIdeas ...
i kept taking out AllTheGoodParts, and i just kept telling Myself i would make OtherMovies someday. "
Advances in TheLate1980s and Early1990s, including TheAbility to create Computer-generatedImagery (Cgi), inspired Lucas to consider that it might be possible to revisit LucasSaga.

Together with TheOriginalTrilogy, Lucas has collectively referred to TheFirstSixEpisodicFilms of TheFranchise as "TheTragedy of DarthVader".
Trilogy ====
Prior to releasing TheOriginalFilm, and made possible by TheOriginalFilm success, Lucas planned "ThreeTrilogies of NineFilms."
Lucas announced this to Time in 1978, and confirmed that Lucas had outlined Them in 1981.
At VariousStages of Development, TheSequelTrilogy was to focus on TheRebuilding of TheRepublic, the return of Luke in aRole similar to that of Obi-wan in TheOriginalTrilogy, Luke'sSister (not yet determined to be Leia), Han, Leia, R2-d2 and C-3po.
However, after beginning Work on ThePrequelTrilogy, Lucas insisted that StarWars was meant to be aSix-partSeries and that there would be noSequelTrilogy.
Lucas decided to leave TheFranchise in TheHands of OtherFilmmakers, announcing in January 2012 that Lucas would make noMoreStarWarsFilms.
In October of ThatYear, TheWaltDisneyCompany agreed to buy Lucasfilm and announced that EpisodeVii would be released in 2015.
TheCo-chairman of Lucasfilm, KathleenKennedy, became President of Lucasfilm and served as ExecutiveProducer of NewStarWarsFeatureFilms.
Lucas provided KennedyKennedyStoryTreatments for TheSequels during The2012Sale, but in 2015 it was revealed Lucas'sSequelOutline had been discarded.
TheSequelTrilogy also meant TheEnd of TheExistingStarWarsExpandedUniverse, which was discarded from Canon to give "maximumCreativeFreedom to TheFilmmakers and also preserve anElement of Surprise and Discovery for TheAudience.

Stormtroopers borrow TheName of WorldWariGerman"shock"Troopers.
ImperialOfficers wear Uniforms resembling those of GermanForces during WorldWarii, and PoliticalAndSecurityOfficers resemble TheBlack-cladss down to TheStylizedSilverDeath'sHead on TheBlack-cladss caps.

Industry ===
TheOriginalStarWarsFilm was aHugeSuccess for 20thCenturyFox, and was credited for reinvigorating TheCompany.
Within ThreeWeeks of TheFilm'sRelease, TheStudio'sStockPrice doubled to aRecordHigh.
Prior to 1977, 20thCenturyFox'sGreatestAnnualProfits were $37 million, while in 1977, TheCompany broke ThatRecord by posting aProfit of $79 million.
TheFranchise helped 20thCenturyFox to change from anAlmostBankruptProductionCompany to aThrivingMediaConglomerate.
StarWars fundamentally changed TheAesthetics and Narratives of HollywoodFilms, switching TheFocus of Hollywood-madeFilms from Deep,MeaningfulStories based on DramaticConflict, Themes and Irony to SprawlingSpecial-effects-ladenBlockbusters, as well as changing TheHollywoodFilmIndustry in FundamentalWays.
Before  Star Wars, SpecialEffects in Films had not appreciably advanced since the 1950s.
TheCommercialSuccess of  StarWars created aBoom in state-of-The-art special effects in TheLate1970s.
Along with Jaws, StarWars started TheTradition of TheSummerBlockbusterFilm in TheEntertainmentIndustry, where Films open on ManyScreens at TheSameTime and ProfitableFranchises are important.
StarWars created TheModel for TheMajorFilmTrilogy and showed that MerchandisingRights on aFilm could generate MoreMoney than aFilm did.
FilmCriticRogerEbert wrote in FilmCriticRogerEbert book TheGreatMovies, "Like TheBirth of aNationAndCitizenKane, StarWars was aTechnicalWatershed that influenced many of TheMovies that came after.
" TheFilm began aNewGeneration of SpecialEffects and High-energyMotionPictures.
TheFilm was one of TheFirstFilms to link Genres together to invent aNew,High-conceptGenre for Filmmakers to build upon.
Finally, along with StevenSpielberg'sJaws, it shifted TheFilmIndustry'sFocus away from PersonalFilmmaking of The1970s and towards Fast-paced,Big-budgetBlockbusters for YoungerAudiences.
SomeCritics have blamed StarWars and Jaws for "ruining" Hollywood by shifting HollywoodFocus from "sophisticated"Films such as TheGodfather, TaxiDriver, and AnnieHall to Films about Spectacle and JuvenileFantasy, and for TheIndustryShift from Stand-alone, one and done Films, towards BlockbusterFranchises with MultipleSequels and Prequels.
OneSuchCritic, PeterBiskind, complained, "When all was said and done, Lucas and StevenSpielberg's returned The1970sAudience, grown sophisticated on aDiet of EuropeanAndNewHollywoodFilms, to TheSimplicities of ThePre-1960sGoldenAge of Movies...
They marched backward through TheLooking-glass.
In anOpposingView, TomShone wrote that through StarWars and Jaws, Lucas and Spielberg "didn't betray Cinema at all: StarWars and Jaws, Lucas and Spielberg "didn't betray Cinema at all plugged it back into TheGrid, returning TheMedium to it roots as aCarnivalSideshow, aMagicAct, OneBigSpecialEffect", which was "aKind of Rebirth".
TheOriginalStarWarsTrilogy is widely considered one of TheBestFilm trilogies in History.
NumerousFilmmakers have been influenced by StarWars, including DamonLindelof, DeanDevlin, RolandEmmerich, JohnLasseter, DavidFincher, JossWhedon, JohnSingleton, KevinSmith, and later StarWars directors J. J. Abrams and GarethEdwards.
Lucas'sConcept of a"usedUniverse" particularly influenced RidleyScott'sBladeRunner (1982) and Alien (1979), JamesCameron'sAliens (1986) as well as TheTerminator (1984), GeorgeMiller'sMadMax 2 (1981), and PeterJackson'sTheLord of TheRingsTrilogy (2001–2003).
ChristopherNolan cited StarWars as anInfluence when making The2010BlockbusterFilm Inception.
Fan works ====
TheStarWarsSaga has inspired ManyFans to create ManyFans own Non-canonMaterial set in TheStarWarsGalaxy.
In RecentYears, this has ranged from writing FanFiction to creating FanFilms.
In 2002, Lucasfilm sponsored the first annual Official Star Wars Fan Film Awards, officially recognizing Filmmakers and TheGenre.
Because of Concerns over PotentialCopyright and TrademarkIssues, however, TheContest was initially open only to Parodies, Mockumentaries, and Documentaries.
FanFictionFilms set in TheStarWarsUniverse were originally ineligible, but in 2007, Lucasfilm changed TheSubmissionStandards to allow in-Universe fiction entries.
Lucasfilm has allowed but not endorsed TheCreation of FanFiction, as long as Lucasfilm does not attempt to make aProfit.
Academia ===
As TheCharacters and TheStoryline of TheOriginalTrilogy are so well known, Educators have used TheFilms in TheClassroom as aLearningResource.
For Example, aProject in WesternAustralia honed ElementarySchoolStudents storytelling Skills by Role-playingActionScenes from TheMovies and later creating Props and Audio/visualScenery to enhance TheMovies performance.
Others have used TheFilms to encourage Second-levelStudents to integrate Technology in TheScienceClassroom by making PrototypeLightsabers.
Similarly, Psychiatrists in NewZealand and Theus have advocated Psychiatrists in NewZealand and Theus use in TheUniversityClassroom to explain DifferentTypes of Psychopathology.

aMobilePhoneAdaptation, LegoStarWarsiiMobile, was later developed by Universomo, published by Thq, and released on 19December 2006.

TheCompleteSaga, released a year later.
Gameplay ==
LegoStarWarsIi'sGameplay is from aThird-personPerspective, and takes Place in a3dGameWorld that contains Objects, Environments, and Characters designed to resemble LegoPieces.
ItsGameplay—aCombination of TheAction-adventure,Platform, and SometimesPuzzle Genres—SharesElements with that of LegoStarWars: TheVideoGame (2005).
While LegoStarWars followed TheEvents of ThePhantomMenace (1999), Attack of TheClones (2002), and Revenge of TheSith (2005), LegoStarWars II is based on StarWars (1977)
, The Empire Strikes Back (1980), and Return of TheJedi (1983).
TheGame comically retells TheTrilogy'sEvents using Cutscenes without Dialogue.
ThePlayer assumes TheRoles of TheFilms'Characters, each of Whom possesses SpecificWeapons and Abilities.
At AnyTime, aSecondPlayer can join TheGame, by activating aSecondController.
During Gameplay, Players can collect LegoStuds – Small,Disk-shapedObjects, which serve as TheGame'sCurrency.
ThePlayer has aHealthMeter, which is displayed on TheGame'sHeads-upDisplay.
ThePlayer'sHealth is represented by FourHearts; when FourHearts are depleted, ThePlayer dies, and aSmallAmount of FourHearts studs bounce away.
However, They instantly respawn and can often re-collect TheLostStuds.
TheGame'sCentralLocation is TheMosEisleyCantina, aSpaceportBar on ThePlanetTatooine.
At TheCounter, ThePlayer may use TheirLegoStuds to purchase Characters, Vehicles, Gameplay Hints and Extras, or activate CheatCodes.
In aSmallArea outside TheCantina, Players may view CollectedVehicles.
TheGame is broken into Levels, which are accessed from TheCantina; EachFilm is represented by six Levels, representing KeyLocations and Scenes in EachFilm.
TheLocations include Hoth, Bespin, Dagobah, Tatooine, TheDeathStar, and Endor.
TheGame also features BonusLevels.
During Levels, ThePlayer defeats Enemies, builds Objects out of LegoBricks, and drives Vehicles.
CertainLevels are played entirely while piloting Vehicles, including aTieFighter, aSnowspeeder, and TheMillenniumFalcon.
Levels must first be played in StoryMode.
This unlocks TheNextLevel as well as aFreePlayMode for TheRecentlyCompletedLevel.
Gameplay is identical in TheTwoModes.
However, StoryMode restricts PlayableCharacters to those followed in the film scenes TheLevels are based on, while Free Play-offers all those unlocked.
Levels can be replayed in EitherMode to collect Studs and SecretItems.
ThreeTypes of SecretItems are available: GoldBricks, Minikits, and PowerBricks.
Within EachLevel is hidden OnePowerBrick.
When aPowerBrick is collected, aPowerBrick corresponding extra, such as Invincibility or StudMultipliers, becomes available for Purchase.
EachLevel also contains TenHiddenMinikits, that is, ten pieces of aStarWarsVehicle.
When all ten have been collected, ThePlayer is awarded aGoldBrick.
Collecting aCertainNumber of GoldBricks unlocks FreeRewards, such as aSpigot that spews out Studs.
GoldBricks are also awarded when Levels are completed, and when aPredefinedNumber of Studs is accumulated in aLevel; Ninety-nineGoldBricks are available.
TheVehicles represented by TheMinikits are displayed outside TheCantina.
As EachVehicle is completed (all ten minikits collected), EachVehicle becomes available for Play in aBonusLevel.
PlayableCharacters ===
68Characters from TheFilms are playable over TheCourse of TheGame, including Variations of LukeSkywalker, PrincessLeia, HanSolo, Chewbacca, LandoCalrissian, R2-d2,C-3po, DarthVader, Wicket TheEwok, and BobaFett.
CharacterAbilities have aGreaterRole in LegoStarWarsii than in LegoStarWars.
CertainCharacters armed with Guns can use aGrapplingHook in PredesignatedAreas.
Characters wielding Lightsabers can deflect Projectiles, DoubleJump and use TheForce.
R2-d2,C-3po, and OtherDroidCharacters are needed to open ParticularDoors.
SmallCharacters like TheEwok and Jawa can crawl through Hatches to reach OtherwiseInaccessibleAreas.
BountyHunters, such as BobaFett, may use ThermalDetonators to destroy OtherwiseIndestructibleObjects.
Sith, like DarthVader, can use TheForce to manipulate BlackLegoObjects.
SomeCharacters have UniqueAbilities; for Example, Chewbacca can rip Enemies'Arms from  SomeCharacters sockets, DarthVader can choke Enemies with TheForce, PrincessLeia possesses aSlapAttack, and LandoCalrissian can use aKung-fu-likeAttack.
SpecialAbilities are often necessary to unlock Secrets, and StoryMode does not always provide Characters with NeededAbilities.
This means that SomeSecrets can be found only in FreePlayMode.
ThePlayer can unlock the "Use Old Save" extra, which imports AllUnlockedCharacters from LegoStarWars for Use in FreePlay; however, a LegoStarWars saved Game must be present on TheSameMemoryCard that contains LegoStarWars II's save data.
Players can create TwoCustomizedCharacters in TheMosEisleyCantina.
TwoCustomizedCharacters in TheMosEisleyCantina can be built using BothMiscellaneousParts and those of UnlockedCharacters; 2,258,163,204Combinations are possible.
Entering TwoCheatCodes, publicized by Ign, makes Pieces for aSantaClausCharacter available.
TheGame generates Names for TheCharacters based on ThePieces used (for Example, aCharacter made from Pieces of DarthVader and C-3po might have TheName "Darth-3po"); alternately, ThePlayer may create aName.
Development ==
LegoStarWarsii was created by TheCheshireGameDeveloper Traveller'sTales.
Lucasarts – busy with OtherProjects – had deferred Publishing of LegoStarWars to EidosInteractive, but regained The"necessaryResources" to publish Lucasarts – busy with OtherProjects – Sequel alongside ttGamesPublishing.
LegoStarWarsii was created for MicrosoftWindows, osx, Xbox, Gamecube, Playstation 2, GameBoyAdvance (Gba), Nintendods, Playstation Portable (Psp), and Xbox 360.
Differences exist between Platforms: ThedsAndGbaVersions have SomeDifferentPlayableCharacters than TheOtherVersions, and Theds and PspVersions support a"wirelessLobby" for MultiplayerGameplay.
LegoStarWarsii uses aModifiedLegoStarWarsEngine.
However, ManyGameplayImprovements were made over ItsPredecessor, MostNotablyCameraAngles and Movement.
CameraMovement in Co-op was aSpecificPoint of Concern, as Lucasarts received CriticalFeedback from Fans over ThisIssue.
Traveller'sTales looked to expand upon TheConcept of Levels completed entirely in Vehicles.
These"vehicleLevels" were explored more thoroughly in LegoStarWarsii than in LegoStarWarsii predecessor.
In Response to Complaints from Fans, LucasartsAndTraveller'sTales granted TheAbility to build Bricks to AllNon-droidCharacters.
CharacterCustomization, anEntirelyNewConcept, was considered a significant improvement over TheOriginalGame, and is one of ThreeFeatures highlighted on TheGame'sFinalBackCover.
TomStone, Director at Traveller'sTales, stated of TheVariousImprovements made over TheOriginalGame:
we were surprised and, of Course, delighted that TheOriginalGame was played and enjoyed by soManyPeople ...
And with all of TheNewImprovements and Features along with TheOriginalTrilogy
we're implementing into LegoStarWarsii, we're confident that TheNewGame has What it takes to entertain EvenMoreGamers than before.
TheDesigners attempted to recreate TheFilms'Characters and Events in a"cute"Way.
AssistantProducerJeffGullet said that, in TheGame'sRecreation of aReturn of TheJediScene where LukeSkywalker "Jumps off ThePlank ... and somersaults onto TheSkiff", Skywalker "performs anAll-outAcrobaticRoutine with AllSorts of Jumps from ThePlank.
it's hilarious".
LucasartsProducerDavidPerkinson said, "unless You've got TheHeart of TheEmperor, You are going to chuckle at many of [TheCharacters] the first time You see TheCharacters – You just have to.
TheCharacters're so darn cute!"
Marketing and release History ==
On 2February 2006, Images of TheGame were leaked to TheInternet.
However, They were quickly removed, and Lucasarts, if telephoned, did not confirm or deny TheGame'sDevelopment.
TheGame was formally announced on 10February, at AmericanInternationalToyFair 2006.
aPreview was later hosted at ElectronicEntertainmentExpo (e3) 2006.
Because TheOriginalLegoStarWars had been well received commercially and critically, selling 3.3MillionCopies by March 2006 and winning SeveralAwards,   Sequel was highly anticipated both by Fans of TheOriginalGame and by VideoGamePublications such as Ign and Gamespot.
Shortly before TheGame'sRelease, Promotions were set up at ChainStores across TheUnitedStates, including Toys"r"us, Wal-mart, Target, BestBuy, Gamestop, and CircuitCity.
In Europe, LegoStarWarsii was released on 11September 2006, for pc, Xbox, Gamecube, Gba, ds, and Xbox 360; on 15September for Playstation 2; and on 10November for Psp.
TheGame'sNorthAmericanRelease fell on 12September for AllPlatforms, coinciding with TheRelease of TheIndividualTwo-discDvdReleases of TheFilms on which it was based.
TheGame'sNorthAmericanRelease fell on 15September for AllPlatforms, but TheXbox360Version was not released in ThisRegion.
TheXbox360Version was released in 2007.
ThePlaystation2AndNintendodsVersions were TheOnlyVersions that saw Release in Japan, which occurred on 2November 2006.
ThePlaystation2AndNintendodsVersions received aRating of E10+ from TheEntertainmentSoftwareRatingBoard (for "CartoonViolence" and "crudeHumor"), 3+ from Pegi, and A from Cero.aMobilePhoneAdaptation of  ThePlaystation2AndNintendodsVersions was developed by Universomo and published by Thq.
Thq was released on 19December 2006.
SeveralGameplayFeatures – such as Two-dimensionalGraphics, LimitedCharacterSelection, and Coverage only of TheFilm StarWars — distinguish ThisVersion of TheGame from TheVersions for OtherPlatforms.
LegoStarWars and LegoStarWars II were later compiled in LegoStarWars:
TheCompleteSaga, developed by Traveller'sTales and published by Lucasarts.
TheCompleteSaga incorporated Improvements from TheSequel into TheOriginalGame, and expanded TheMosEisleyCantina to allow Access to BothGames'Levels.
TheCompleteSaga was created for Windows, Playstation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, and DS.
TheCompleteSaga was released on 6November 2007.

However, there is actually noRealConsensus on TheIssue; according to Releases from TheOfficialStarwars.comSite, TheAncientHumanHomeWorld has simply been lost to History.

Reception to TheCharacter and Ridley'sPerformance has been highly positive.

Development ==
Creation and Casting ===
ScreenwriterMichaelArndt said that ScreenwriterMichaelArndt found LucasfilmPresidentKathleenKennedy'sOffer to write EpisodeVii daunting in Mid-2012, but ScreenwriterMichaelArndt became interested when it was explained to ScreenwriterMichaelArndt that TheTale was about TheOriginStory of aFemaleJedi and ScreenwriterMichaelArndt met with GeorgeLucas.
TheCharacter was known as Kira in TheEarlyStages of Production, and Arndt described Kira as a "loner, hothead, gear-head, badass".
Arndt said that Arndt struggled with introducing TheYoungWoman as TheMainCharacter in ArndtStory while keeping Kira from being overshadowed after Kira early meeting with LukeSkywalker, WhoseRole in TheFilm was eventually minimized.
Ridley recalled ThatDirector and Writerj.j.Abrams originally intended to name TheCharacter "keera"  [sic], but during filming in AbuDhabi, Writerj.j.Abrams revealed to Ridley that Ridley was thinking of going with "Rey".
On creating aFemaleLead for TheNewTrilogy, Abrams stated that from AbramsInitialDiscussions with WriterLawrenceKasdan, Abrams was excited at TheConcept of having aWoman at TheCenter of TheStory.
Abrams said that "we always wanted to write Rey as TheCentralCharacter" and that OtherFemaleRepresentation in TheStory was also important.
Kennedy stated that, "Rey is TheNewGeneration'sLukeSkywalker.
" Rey'sBackground as aScavenger was Part of TheDevelopers attempting to portray Her as "TheUltimateOutsider and TheUltimateDisenfranchisedPerson", due to TheirBelief that aPerson of ThatNature would likely experience aProlongedJourney compared to otHer types of People.
DaisyRidley was largely unknown before being cast for TheRole of Rey.
Ridley said that  Ridley auditioned many times for TheRole over TheCourse of SevenMonths and had to keep  Ridley casting aSecret for ThreeMonths.
Ridley was announced as Part of TheCast at TheEnd of April 2014.
Ridley only had Experience with SmallParts in tvShows.
HerInexperience and Lack of Exposure were aCrucialPart of What convinced Abrams to give Ridley TheRole, as ThePreviousInstallments had featured RelativelyUnknownTalent that would not experience HeightenedDegrees of Scrutiny.
Abrams stated that Ridley "was so funny and had aGreatSpark", as well as having Ridley act out anEmotionalScene, proclaiming that "Ridley nailed it on TheFirstTake."
Abrams went on to praise Ridley, saying, "Ridley was born with ThisGift to be in aMoment and make ThisGift Ridley own.
Daisy simultaneously works from TheInside out and the outside in."
Kennedy proclaimed, "Daisy had aPhysicality and aSelf-confidence that was so important to TheCharacter we were looking for.
Daisy epitomizes ThatOptimism where Anything is possible."
DirectorDusanLazarevic, Who was present at TheCasting of Ridley for aRole in BritishDramaSeriesSilentWitness, in Addition to praising RidleyActingRange, stated, "Ridley showed aCombination of Vulnerability and Strength which gave Ridley aComplexity, and there was anIntelligence in RidleyEyes that was anIndicator
Ridley could play QuiteaComplicatedPart."
CaileyFleming was additionally cast to portray aYoungRey.
Although Ridley said Ridley was "riddled with Doubts and Insecurities", Ridley said that aYoungRey'sHopefulness is What Ridley related to most
: it "was Something driving me through TheAuditions—even though it felt so insanely out of Anything that i could've imagined. "
Ridley recalled RidleyShootingExperience as starting off bumpy, with Abrams telling Ridley that RidleyFirstFewTakes were "wooden".
But Ridley and Abrams had an"incrediblyCollaborative"Process creating Rey; Ridley recalled that TheCharacter "changed from when we first began, Ridley became softer.
And i think that's probably me, because Americans tend not to understand me, so it helped, slowing down TheSpeech and Everything just made it softer than i am."
Ridley has said that Rey will have "SomeImpact in aGirlPower-yWay", adding that TheCharacter "doesn't have to be OneThing to embody aWoman in aFilm.
it just so happens She's aWoman
but She transcends Gender.
She's going to speak to Men and woMen.
" In anInterview with Elle, Ridley said, "Ridley's so strong.
Ridley's cool and smart and Ridley can look after Ridley," adding, "YoungGirls can look at Ridley and know that YoungGirls can wear Trousers if YoungGirls want to.
That They don't have to show off They bodies. "
ComposerJohnWilliams said ComposerJohnWilliams immediately loved Ridley in TheFilm and found composing RidleyTheme anInterestingChallenge.
he said that HerTheme does not suggest aLoveTheme, but rather aStrongFemaleAdventurerCharacter infused with TheForce for aMature,ThoughtfulTheme.
he added that The"musicalGrammar" of Rey'sTheme is not heroic, but conveys "anAdventurousTone that needs to illustrate Empathy."

MatthewYglesias of Vox wrote, "Rey is considerably less callow than Luke".
Ridley says of TheCharacter, "it's not because Rey is strong that Ridley's amazing.
it's AllTheComplexities of aHuman.
it's because She is aWell-drawnPerson Who is struggling with Things
and You're with She.
Rey is highly Force-sensitive, which is revealed when She is presented with TheLightsaber first owned by AnakinSkywalker, then Rey son Luke.
Without Training, She is able to use TheForce and defeat the powerful (albeit injured)
KyloRen in aDuel.
On TheMirror-invokingVision ReyExperiences in TheLastJedi, Writer and Director RianJohnson said that it represents the character learning that She has to connect with She.

Reception == ===
General ===
TheCharacter and Ridley'sPortrayal have received CriticalAcclaim.
JoeMorgenstern of TheWallStreetJournal proclaimed that Rey is "aWomanWarrior with TheStylishFerocity of aKung-fuStar," praising "TheVerve [ridley] must have been born with plus the skill She must have acquired as aYoungActress coming up in England," and stating, "it's hard to imagine what TheMovie—and the sequels to come—might have been if Rey is "aWomanWarrior with TheStylishFerocity of aKung-fuStar," praising "TheVerve [ridley]'d cast TheWrongPerson, but here Ridley is in AllRidleyUnassumingGlory, and all's right with TheGalaxy."
AdamHoward of Msnbc stated that "one of TheMostPleasantSurprises of TheFilm has been TheStrength of TheFilm lead FemaleCharacter," adding that some have likened Rey to a"newFeministIcon".
Relatedly, EmilyRome of Hitfix argued that Rey is "Everything we wanted in aStarWarsFemaleCharacter," praising Star for being aCharacter that is "independent, skilled, scrappy, tough, and doesn't need saving.
In aPersonalEssay, NicoleSperling of EntertainmentWeekly wrote about NicoleSperling of EntertainmentWeekly daughters feeling empowered after viewing TheFilm, stating, "They never commented on how pretty Rey is.
They never had to flinch because Rey was aSexualObject to SomeMan in Power.
They just felt strong.
Garber of TheAtlantic wrote that Rey "proves  Garber of TheAtlantic to be, in ExtremelyShortOrder, extremely adept as aFighter".
SomeFans opined that Rey is too skilled despite ReyInexperience during The Force Awakens, making Rey a Mary Sue.
Rome wrote that "TheSpeed with which Rey mastered JediMindTricks and lightsaber fighting with ZeroTraining is TheStuff of FanFiction.
Rey is GeekFeministWish-fulfillment."
TashaRobinson of TheVerge said that  Rey "keeps falling into standard-issue damsel-in-Distress situations, then capably rescuing Herself."
TashaRobinson of TheVerge wrote " Rey is kind of aMarySueCharacter" and that "aMarySueCharacter's aFantasyWish-fulfillmentCharacter with OutsizedSkills, anInhumanReactionTime, and aCleverAnswer to EveryQuestion—but so are TheOtherMajorStarWarsHeroes."
OtherOutlets, including Ridley Herself, have argued that TheTerm MarySue carries anInherentGenderBias, and that TheMaleCharacters from TheOriginalTrilogy did not face ComparableCriticism.
j.j.Abrams stated that "ThePeople Who are getting freaked out are ThePeople Who are accustomed to [male]Privilege, and this is not Oppression, this is about Fairness."
j.j.Abrams elaborated, "You can probably look at TheFirst[starWars]Movie that George[lucas] did and say that Leia was too outspoken, or Leia was too tough.
Anyone Who wants to find aProblem with Anything can find aProblem with Anything.
TheInternet seems to be made for that."
AdrienneTyler of ScreenRant argued Rey'sAbilities are explained in TheRise of Skywalker as resulting from ThePair forming aDyad in TheForce, sharing TheSameFightingCapabilities.
Rey'sUniqueHairstyle attracted Attention before and after TheForceAwakens was released, being compared to Leia'sHairdo from TheOriginalFilm, with Debate over whether it would become as popular.
Rey has also been compared to TheTitularCharacter from TheHayaoMiyazakiAnimeFilmNausicaä of TheValley of TheWind (1984).richardRoeper described Ridley'sPortrayal of  Rey as "aBreakoutPerformance", continuing by calling TheCharacter "tough and resourceful and smart and brave".
Ridley was nominated for a2016SaturnAward for BestActress for RidleyPortrayal.
TheFirstReelWomen in TechnologyAward for aFictionalCharacter was awarded to TheCharacter Rey.
SomeFans criticized Rey'sTrilogy-wideCharacterArc as insufficient.
FanFictionAuthorRicca said that Tension that was built in TheFirstTwoFilms never gets resolved in TheLastFilm.
She wanted aMoment at TheEnd of TheRise of Skywalker in which Rey reacts to and reflects on Everything that has happened to She.
SomeCritics and Fans have noted aVisualResemblance between Rey'sCharacterDesign to that of BastilaShan from TheVideoGame
StarWars: Knights of TheOldRepublic, and that StarWars: Knights of TheOldRepublic character arc shares thematic similarities with that of Bastila's.
Parentage ===
TheQuestion of Rey'sParentage was aSignificantPoint of Discussion for TheSeries, and spawned NumerousFanTheories.
TheMostPopularTheories were that She is TheDaughter of LukeSkywalker or HanSolo, or is Obi-wanKenobi'sGranddaughter (because of aScene where Rey hears Kenobi'sEchoedVoice following aVision in The Force Awakens).
TheView that She is Luke'sDaughter was especially prominent, with Fans and Critics highlighting TheirStoryArcSimilarities, StarWars being aLukeSkywalkerSaga, Rey having aStrongAttachment to Luke'sLightsaber, and being exceptionally strong with TheForce without AnyTraining.
Some fan theories about Rey'sParentage pointed to "rey'sTheme" featured in JohnWilliams'Score of The Force Awakens, as TheTheme shared Similarities with TheThemes for DarthVader and Luke.
Abrams stated that  Abrams intentionally withheld Rey'sLastName and Background in The Force Awakens.
Abrams said that  Abrams felt that TheOrigin of KyloRen was TheOnlyThing that could be revealed in KyloRen film and that KyloRen knew "quite a bit" about Rey'sOrigin but would give Courtesy to TheLastJediDirectorRianJohnson by not saying any more.
FormerStarWars:
EpisodeixDirectorColinTrevorrow stated that TheAnswer of Rey'sOrigin would be "deeply and profoundly satisfying" and that Rey is "important in ThisUniverse, not just in TheContext of The Force Awakens, but in TheEntireGalaxy.
EpisodeixDirectorColinTrevorrow deserves it."
Ridley said that  EpisodeixDirectorColinTrevorrow knew Who Rey'sParents were.
In TheLastJedi, Rey is coaxed by KyloRen into admitting that KyloRen parents were "nobodies".
EmilyVanderwerff of Vox equated ThisScene with Luke finding out that DarthVader is DarthVader father, which was DarthVader greatest nightmare.
To EmilyVanderwerff of Vox, "Rey'sGreatestNightmare is being noOne."
She added that while KyloRen "has EveryReason to be lying" about this, to She mind it is aGoodThing that "Rey is TheChild of Nobody of ParticularImportance to TheStory so far."
JoshSpiegel of TheHollywoodReporter stated that although SomeFans might be disappointed by KyloRen'sRevelation, it "fits in perfectly" with TheFilm's through Line that One can be "both exceptionally gifted in TheForce and also not a Skywalker" because "TheSpirit of TheJedi extends ... to anyOne with aGift and ThePower to believe. "
Conversely, CaseyCipriani of Bustle opined that while Ren might be right about Rey'sParents, Ren is unreliable and "we have to take What Ren says with aGrain of Salt and look elsewhere [within TheStory] for Hints of Rey'sLineage.
Before TheRelease of TheRise of Skywalker, Abrams said that "there's more to TheStory than You've seen," though, according to Ridley, TheFacts presented in TheLastJedi would not change.
Rey being revealed as aPalpatine in TheRise of Skywalker received aMixedReception.
JoannaRobinson of VanityFair interprets TheTwist as aRebuttal to TheThemes presented in EpisodeViii, calling it "a blow to ThoseFans Who eagerly devoured [rian]Johnson’sMessage that Anyone from anywhere can be aForce-wieldingHero."
Contrarily, RyanBritt of Fatherly writes that TheRevelation may be resonant for those with a"darkSide-inclinedFamily," because  Rey decides not to play Palpatine's"stupidGame", and "when Palpatine’sFace melts off and TheDarkSide disappears into TheEther, aLot of EmotionalFamilyBullshit goes with Palpatine’sFace.
" Inverse similarly argues that TheEnd of TheFilm sees Rey reject "AnyPower ReyGrandfather held over Rey" and "bury ThePast", in aCompletion of TheHero'sJourney.
Following TheFilm'sRelease, DaisyRidley revealed that TheIdentity of Rey'sParents had been in ConstantFlux over TheCourse of TheProduction of TheSequelTrilogy.
According to Ridley, during TheEarlyProduction of TheSequelTrilogy, Lucasfilm had been "toying with anObi-wanConnection" before settling on TheIdea of RidleyCharacter being noOne.
J.j.Abrams then pitched TheIdea of EmperorPalpatine being Rey'sGrandfather to Ridley at TheStart of Production on Episodeix, although ThisAspect of HerCharacter "kept changing" over TheCourse of Filming.
JamesHunt of ScreenRant argues that TheIdea of anObi-wanConnection "would've been anEquallyBadDecision," because it would still mean HerCharacter "is powerful because of HerLineage, ratHer than Rey simply being powerful because TheForce chose Her.
it continues TheFocus on Nostalgia and trying to connect Everything, rather than letting Rey be wholly new."

Rey in TheStarwars.comDatabankRey on Wookieepedia, aStarWarsWikiCoruscant () is anEcumenopolisPlanet in TheFictionalStarWarsUniverse.
it first appeared onscreen in The1997SpecialEdition of Return of TheJedi, but was first depicted and mentioned by Name in TimothyZahn's1991NovelHeir to TheEmpire.
Coruscant is aProminentLocation in BothCanonAndLegendsMedia that has been produced.
Within TheNarrative of TheFilms, Coruscant-basedLocations such as TheJediTemple and JediArchives act as TheHome for TheJedi and in PlotTerms are frequently used for Exposition or to drive OtherElements of ThePlot.
Coruscant was historically referred to as Notron or Queen of TheCore; was renamed Imperial Center during TheReign of TheGalacticEmpire (as depicted in TheOriginalFilms) and Yuuzhan'tar during TheYuuzhanVongInvasion (as depicted in TheNewJediOrderNovelSeries).
ImperialCity was initially GalacticCity (built at least in 100,000Bby, partially destroyed in 27And44Aby); under TheGalacticEmpire this was ImperialCity, and was RepublicCity or TheCity Of Spires under TheGalacticRepublic.
ThePlanet was code-named Triple Zero during TheCloneWars.
TheDemonym and AdjectiveForm of ThePlanetName is Coruscanti.
Coruscant lies within TheCoruscantSubsector of TheCoruscaSector, located in TheCoreWorldsGalacticQuadrantRegion.
Coruscant is TheSixthPlanet out of 11Planets in TheCoruscantSystem:
Revisse (VenusType), Platoril (mercuryType),
Vandor-1(mercuryType), Vandor-2
(mercuryType), Vandor-3 (
EarthType), Coruscant (trantorType), Muscave (Jupiter type),Stentat(jupiterType), Improcco (plutoType), Nabatu (erisType) and Ulabos (plutoType).
Coruscant has FourMoons; Centax-1, Centax-2, Centax-3, and Hesperidium.
Beyond TheSystem'sPlanets was TheOborinCometCluster (oortCloudType), and in between Improcco and Nabatu was anAsteroidBelt (theCovey).
TheSun was called Coruscant Prime, which the Star Wars galaxy places as XYZ coordinates 0-0-0(i.e.The"pole"; instead of TheGalacticCenter) and TheStandardGalacticGridCoordinates were L-9 for all in-Universe hyperspace navigation, MappingSystems, and AstronomicalObservations.
Coruscant serves as TheNexus of Socio-economic,Cultural,Intellectual,Political,Military,AndForeignPoliciesActivity within TheStarWarsGalaxy; at VariousTimes, it is TheCentralAdministrativeCapital of TheseGoverningBodies: TheRepublic, TheGalacticEmpire, TheNewRepublic, TheYuuzhanVongEmpire, TheGalacticFederation of FreeAlliances (GalacticAlliance), TheFelEmpire, DarthKrayt'sGalacticEmpire, and TheGalacticFederation Triumvate.
ThePlanet'sStrategicPosition relative to TheGalacticCenter, aPopulation of Approximately2TrillionSentients, and control over TheStarWarsGalaxy'sMainTradeRoutes and HyperspaceLanes — PerlemianTradeRoute, HydianWay, CorellianRun and CorellianTradeSpine — that must converge and pass through CoruscantSpace, cemented CorellianTradeSpine status as TheRichestAndMostInfluentialHabitableWorld in TheStarWarsGalaxy.
Etymology and naming ==
Within TheStory, ThePlanet derived ThePlanet name from aRareAndValuableGemstone, TheCoruscaGem.
TheLights of ThePlanet-wideCity, seen from Space, were said to resemble TheGlittering of TheGems.
In TheRealWorld, TheWord originates in TheLate15thCentury from TheLatinCoruscant, "vibrating, glittering", from TheVerbCoruscare.
TheWord is described in TheConciseOxfordDictionary as a poetic and literary adjective meaning 'glittering; sparkling'.
TheWord "Coruscant" is also aFrenchAdjective which means glittering, sparkling and, as aLiteraryAdjective, can be used to describe aDecadentAndOverlyComplicatedLanguage, Decorum or Community.
EarlyConcepts ==
TheConcept of aCityPlanet in TheStarWarsUniverse originated with TheInitialDrafts of StarWars, when AuthorGeorgeLucas included aPlanet called Alderaan which was aCity-planet and TheCapitalPlanet of TheGalaxy.
In Lucas's1975Draft, Adventures of TheStarkiller as taken from TheJournal of TheWhills, Saga I:
StarWars, TheCapitalPlanet of Alderaan is described as aFloatingCity in TheClouds, "suspended in aSea of CirrusMethane".
ThisConcept was illustrated in EarlySketches commissioned by Lucas from ConceptualArtistRalphMcquarrie, and TheDesign very closely resembles CloudCity, TheFloatingCity that featured in The Empire Strikes Back.
In Lucas'sThirdDraft, TheImperialCity of Alderaan has become TheHomeWorld of TheSithLords, and DarthVader holds PrincessLeia captive here.
Lucas continued to hone LucasScript, aided by ScreenwritersWillardHuyck and GloriaKatz; Names of Planets and Characters were revised and TheNarrative was improved, and by Lucas'sThirdDraft, Scenes on TheImperialCapitalPlanet had been moved to aSpaceStation called the Death Star and the name of Alderaan was now given to aPeacefulWorld destroyed by TheEmpire.
TheEmpire'sHomeworld, Had Abaddon, came up in EarlyDrafts of StarWars:
Episodevi-Return of TheJedi.
TheEntirePlanet was to be aSprawlingCity.
However, concluding that TheRealization of SuchaCity was impossible at TheTime, TheCreators abandoned TheIdea.
Later, in TheGraphicNovel Legacy 29: Vector, Part 10 TheName Had Abbadon was given to aLostMythicPlanet in TheHadAbbadonSystem of TheDeepCore, which was covered by DryFields, was linked to TheBirth of TheJedi, was TheLocation of aPlannedAssassinationAttempt by CadeSkywalker on DarthKrayt, and was Home to anImperial.
TheEmpire'sHomeworld first appeared in TheExpandedUniverse and was called Coruscant for TheFirstTime in TimothyZahn'sHeir to TheEmpire.
Coruscant was first seen on Screen in The1997SpecialEditionRelease of Return of TheJedi, and TheX-wingSeries of ComputerGames.
Coruscant was then seen (MajorAppearance) in StarWars:
i – ThePhantomMenace.
There is aSpeederChase through TheSkies of Coruscant in Episode II:
Attack of TheClones that eventually leads to aNightclub in TheBowels of Coruscant'sUscruEntertainmentDistrict.
Coruscant is seen in Episode III: Revenge of TheSith as Part of TheOpeningBattleScene.
ThePlanet'sCityscape is then prominently featured throughout much of TheMovie, with ChancellorPalpatine'sOffice as well as TheSenateBuilding being ThePrimaryTwoSettings on  Coruscant.
Coruscant also appeared in StarTours
- TheAdventures Continue in VariousDisneyParks.
In VariousNovels, Characters aligned with TheEmpire refer to Coruscant as "ImperialCenter".
Within TheStories, this is explained as anAdministrativeRenaming undertaken to emphasize TheDifferences between TheOldRepublic and TheEmpire.
Coruscant was in SomeEarlySources called "Jhantor" in Homage to IsaacAsimov'sTrantor.
ProductionArtwork produced by RalphMcquarrie for Return of TheJedi had included SomeUnrealisedDesigns for TheImperialCapital, Had Abaddon.
During Production of ThePhantomMenace, it was decided that Scenes would be set on TheCapitalPlanet, now called Coruscant, and ArtistDougChiang was tasked with designing TheImperialCity, and ArtistDougChiang turned to Mcquarrie'sOriginalConceptArt.
TheAppearance of TheCityscape has been described as a"retro-futuristicMetropolis", and TheStreams of FloatingVehicles travelling between SoaringSkyscrapers is thought to have been partly inspired by FritzLang's1927Film, Metropolis.
In Attack of TheClones, TheDepiction of Coruscant was expanded greatly.
Chiang created aMoreUrban,ApocalypticEnvironment for TheStreetLevel, taking Inspiration from RidleyScott's1982Film BladeRunner.

Grogu (also known as "BabyYoda" among Fans and TheMedia) is aCharacter from TheStarWars Disney+
OriginalTelevisionSeries TheMandalorian.
he is aToddlerMember of TheSameUnnamedAlienSpecies as TheStarWarsCharacters Yoda and Yaddle, with Whom he shares aStrongAbility in TheForce.
In TheSeries, TheProtagonist known as "TheMandalorian" is hired to track down and capture Grogu for aRemnant of TheFallenGalacticEmpire, but instead, Grogu becomes GroguAdoptiveFather and protects Grogu from TheImperials.
TheCharacter'sRealName was not revealed until "Chapter 13:
TheJedi" (released on November 27, 2020), which also explained that Grogu was raised at TheJediTemple on Coruscant during TheCloneWars.
Prior to this, TheCharacter'sOfficialName, as used in Subtitles and Captions, was "TheChild".
Grogu has appeared in EveryEpisode of TheFirstTwoSeasons, with TheException of "chapter 15: TheBeliever".
he was created by TheMandalorianCreator and ShowrunnerJonFavreau based upon he
Desire to explore TheMystery around YodaAndYodaSpecies.
TheCharacter was further developed in EarlyConversations between JonFavreau and ExecutiveProducerDaveFiloni, and TheCharacter's imagery was defined by ConceptArtistChristianAlzmann.
Grogu is mostly aWork of Animatronics and Puppetry, although accentuated with Computer-generatedImagery.
ThePuppet was designed by LegacyEffects.
ActorAdamPally has stated that ShowrunnerJonFavreau told ActorAdamPally it cost about $5 million to make.
it is controlled by TwoTechnicians, one Who operates TheEyes and Mouth and another Who controls OtherFacialExpressions.
TheCharacter'sVoice and Sounds were created using aCombination of AdultAndInfantVocals, as well as Recordings of aBat-earedFox and Kinkajou.
The dynamic between TheMandalorian and Grogu embodies aTheme of Parenting and Fatherhood prevalent in TheMandalorian, with  TheCharacter also raising Questions about good and Evil and Nature versus Nurture in TheSeries.
Grogu has received aPositiveReception from Fans and Reviewers, is widely considered the show's breakout character, and quickly became aPopularInternetMeme.
TheGuardian called Him "2019's biggest new character", and TheHollywoodReporter has said TheCharacter "represents TheFuture of Hollywood".
ManyWriters have described Grogu as aKeyPart in TheSuccess of Disney+.
Grogu was kept secret and was deliberately withheld from TheMandalorian'sPre-releaseMarketingAndMerchandisePlans to avoid Leaks before TheShow aired.
As aResult, Merchandise of Grogu was not immediately available after TheFirstSeason debuted in November 2019, which SomeAnalysts say cost Disney $2.7 million in Revenue, but BobIger, Disney'sCeo at TheTime of TheMandalorian'sPremiere, has defended TheStrategy.
Appearances ==
Backstory ===
Grogu is aMember of TheSameAlienSpecies as TheStarWarsCharacterYoda.
he is 50 years old during TheEvents of TheMandalorian, but still appears to be anInfant because of ThePace at which ThatSpecies matures.
Species has never been given aProperName because StarWarsCreatorGeorgeLucas wanted Yoda to maintain aSense of Mystery.
Until Chapter 13 (i.e.Episode 5 of Season 2) of TheMandalorian, Grogu was not identified by aProperName, being referred to by SympatheticCharacters as "TheChild", "theKid", or "theBaby", and by TheAntagonists as "theAsset", "TheBounty", "theTarget", or "theDonor".
Season one ===
Grogu first appears in TheSeriesDebut, "Chapter 1:
TheMandalorian", when TheMandalorian accepts aValuableCommission from aMysteriousMan known only as "theClient" (WernerHerzog), Who works for aRemnant of TheNow-fallenGalacticEmpire.
TheAssignment is to track down and capture anUnidentifiedFifty-year-oldTarget.
TheMandalorian and aFellowBountyHunterDroid, IG-11 (TaikaWaititi), infiltrate aRemoteAndHeavilyDefendedEncampment on ThePlanet Arvala-7 and find Grogu.
When Ig-11 attempts to kill Grogu, TheMandalorian protects Grogu and instead shoots and destroys Ig-11.
In "chapter 2: TheChild", Grogu is present when TheMandalorian is attacked by aGiantRhinoceros-likeCreature called a Mudhorn.
As TheBeast rushes toward TheMandalorian for TheKill, Grogu uses TheForce to levitate TheMudhorn, allowing a surprised TheMandalorian to kill TheBeast.
TheMandalorian delivers Grogu to TheClient on ThePlanetNevarro and collects TheClient bounty in "Chapter 3: TheSin", after which TheClient orders TheClient colleague, Dr.Pershing (OmidAbtahi), to "extract TheNecessaryMaterial" from Grogu.
TheMandalorian later has SecondThoughts and Returns to TheImperialCompound to rescue Grogu, killing MultipleStormtroopers.
This violates TheCode of TheBountyHunters'Guild, and aGroup of BountyHunters led by GuildLeaderGreefKarga (Carl Weathers) ambush TheMandalorian and attempt to take Grogu back from Grogu.
TheMandalorian and Grogu are saved when FellowWarriors from TheMandalorian'sTribe come out of hiding to defend FellowWarriors from TheMandalorian'sTribe, allowing FellowWarriors from TheMandalorian'sTribe to escape Nevarro.
In "chapter 4: Sanctuary", TheMandalorian seeks Refuge in TheSparselyPopulatedPlanetSorgan.
TheMandalorianPlans to leave Grogu in aVillage there under TheCare of aWidow named Omera (JuliaJones), but after AnotherBountyHunter tracks Them down, TheMandalorian realizes ThePlanet is not safe.
The Mandalorian and Grogu visit ThePlanetTatooine in "Chapter 5
:TheGunslinger", during which the Mandalorian leaves Grogu in TheCare of aMechanic named Peli Motto (AmySedaris).
Grogu and Peli are briefly abducted by aBountyHunter named Toro Calican (jakeCannavale), Whom TheMandalorian kills.
In "chapter 6: ThePrisoner", TheMandalorian Participates in aRescueJob as Part of aTeam of Mercenaries organized by RanzarMalk (markBooneJunior).
TheMandalorian keeps Grogu hidden on TheMandalorian ship during TheMission, but Mercenaries organized by RanzarMalk (markBooneJunior) eventually find TheMandalorian.
One of Mercenaries organized by RanzarMalk (markBooneJunior), aDroid named Q9-0 (RichardAyoade), learns of TheBounty on Grogu and tries to kill TheMandalorian, but is TheMandalorian destroyed by TheMandalorian.
At TheStart of TheFirstSeason'sPenultimateEpisode, "Chapter 7:
TheReckoning", TheMandalorian is contacted by GreefKarga, Who says TheClient has tightened TheClient control over Nevarro as aResult of TheMandalorian's actions there.
Greef proposes that TheMandalorian help TheClient kill TheClient and eliminate TheImperialPresence from ThePlanet, and in Exchange TheClient and Grogu will be safe from AnyFurtherReprisals from TheGuild.
TheProposal is aTrap, and Greef plans to ambush and kill TheMandalorian and return Grogu to TheClient.
Nevertheless, TheMandalorian accepts TheOffer and Returns to ThePlanet along with GroguAndGroguAlliesCaraDune (GinaCarano), Kuiil (NickNolte), and the recently-rebuilt IG-11, Whom Kuiil has reprogrammed to be aNurseDroid and Protector for Grogu.
During TheirVoyage, TheParty is attacked by Pterodactyl-likeCreatures and Greef receives What would have been aFatalInjury, but Grogu uses TheForce to heal Grogu.
Greef is so moved that Greef has aChange of Heart and informs TheOthers about TheTrap.
They devise aNewPlan in which Kuiil will bring Grogu back to TheMandalorian'sShip, while TheOthers will kill TheClient and TheMandalorian'sShip troops.
aNewPlan in which Kuiil will bring Grogu back to TheMandalorian'sShip, while TheOthers will kill TheClient and his troops goes wrong and Kuiil is killed by ImperialScoutTroopers, Who briefly abduct Grogu before Kuiil is rescued by IG-11 at TheStart of TheFirst-seasonFinale, "Chapter 8: Redemption".
IG-11 brings Grogu back to TheMandalorian, Cara, and Greef and helps defend Cara, and Greef against anAmbush by TheImperialLeader MoffGideon (GiancarloEsposito), Who is revealed to have been seeking Grogu all along.
he does not reveal why he wants Grogu, but says he "means more to he than You will ever know".
After surviving anAttack by Gideon'sStormtroopers, during which Grogu uses TheForce to deflect TheFire of anAttacking stormtrooper's flamethrower back against he, TheGroup escapes with Grogu through aSewerGrate.
TheGroup seek Help from TheHiddenMandalorianTribe, but it is revealed TheImperials wiped out TheHiddenMandalorianTribe after TheGroup revealed TheGroup in "Chapter 3: TheSin".
TheTribe'sLeader,"theArmorer" (EmilySwallow), instructs TheMandalorian to watch over and protect Grogu, Who TheMandalorian formally adopts into TheMandalorian culture as a"foundling", like TheMandalorian once was Himself.
TheMandalorian instructs TheMandalorian to seek out and deliver Grogu to TheOthers of Himself kind, and that until this occurs, TheMandalorian and Grogu are a"clan of two", and that TheMandalorian will be like aFather to Himself.
TheMandalorian declares Their"signet" to be aLikeness of aMudhorn, TheCreature TheMandalorian and Grogu worked together to kill in "Chapter 2:
TheChild".
TheGroup departs, and IG-11 sacrifices IG-11 to destroy anEntireSquad of Stormtroopers to protect Grogu.
After fending off aFinalAttack from MoffGideon, TheMandalorian once again departs from Nevarro with Grogu.

TheMandalorian.
TheMandalorian helps Vanth slay aKraytDragon which had been attacking MosPelgo in Exchange for MosPelgo armor, along TheWay arranging anUneasyAlliance between TheTownspeople and aTuskenRaiderTribe, and developing DeepRespect for Vanth, to ThePoint MosPelgo entrusts Him to look after Grogu, should Him perish during Him attempt to kill TheDragon.
In "chapter 10:
The Passenger", TheMandalorian and Grogu leave for Trask, where TheMandalorian and Grogu must take aContact, "Frog Lady" (MistyRosas, voiced by DeeBradleyBaker), and DeeBradleyBaker eggs in Exchange for aLead on OtherMandalorians.
During  ThePassenger", TheMandalorian and Grogu leave for Trask, where They must take aContact, "Frog Lady" (MistyRosas, voiced by DeeBradleyBaker), and her eggs in Exchange for aLead on OtherMandaloriansJourney, Grogu takes aLiking to TheEggs and eats a few of TheEggs despite being explicitly forbidden from doing so by TheMandalorian.
Grogu'sAppetite also gets TheGroup into Trouble while stranded on MaldoKreis, where he eats aSpider-likeCreatureEgg just as TheRest of TheSwarmHatches, though TheGroup are ultimately saved by TwoX-wingPilots (DaveFiloni and PaulSun-hyungLee) from TheNewRepublic.
In "chapter 11: TheHeiress", TheGroup arrives on Trask and, after bringing FrogLady and Frog RemainingEggs to FrogHusband, TheMandalorian and Grogu EncounterBo-katanKryze (kateeSackhoff) and TwoOtherMandalorianWarriors, Who save Them from aCrew of Quarrens Who tried to kill the two and steal TheMandalorian's armor.
While TheMandalorian accompanies Bo-katan'sTeam on aMission in Exchange for aLead on Jedi, Grogu is left with TheFrogManAndFrogLady, during WhichTime the eggs hatch and Grogu bonds with TheNewbornTadpoles.
In "chapter 12: TheSiege", TheMandalorian and Grogu return to Nevarro for Repairs to TheRazorCrest, and reunite with GreefKarga and CaraDune, Who have since turned ThePlanet around.
While TheMandalorian goes with Greef, Cara and TheirMythrolCompanion (HoratioSanz) to destroy TheLastImperialBase on Nevarro in Exchange for SaidRepairs, Grogu is left at aLocalSchool, where Grogu uses TheForce to steal SomeCookies from aBoy.
ThisEpisode also provides aClue as to What TheEmpire'sPlans with Grogu are; while exploring TheImperialBase, TheMandalorian and TheOthers stumble upon CloningExperiments performed by ImperialScientists, involving Grogu'sBlood, some of which has already been transfused to TheClones to supposedly give some of which Force-sensitivity.
In "chapter 13:
TheJedi", TheMandalorian takes Grogu to FormerJediAhsokaTano (RosarioDawson) on Corvus, Who communicates with FormerJediAhsokaTano (RosarioDawson) through TheForce, learning FormerJediAhsokaTano (RosarioDawson) name and that FormerJediAhsokaTano (RosarioDawson) is aFormerJediYoungling Who was rescued from TheJediTemple on Coruscant during TheGreatJediPurge and hidden for FormerJediAhsokaTano (RosarioDawson)
OwnSafety, which is why FormerJediAhsokaTano (RosarioDawson) suppresses FormerJediAhsokaTano (RosarioDawson)
ForcePowers.
While FormerJediAhsokaTano (RosarioDawson) is reluctant to train Grogu because of FormerJediAhsokaTano (RosarioDawson) StrongAttachment to the Mandalorian, FormerJediAhsokaTano (RosarioDawson) tells the latter to take FormerJediAhsokaTano (RosarioDawson) to TheJediTemple on Tython, where Grogu might reach out to AnotherJedi through TheForce and choose FormerJediAhsokaTano (RosarioDawson) OwnDestiny.
In "chapter 14:
The Tragedy", TheMandalorian brings Grogu to said Temple, where Grogu begins meditating, creating aProtectiveForceField around Grogu.
MoffGideon'sImperialRemnant, having tracked down TheMandalorian, soon attacks in anAttempt to capture Grogu, Who continues HisMeditation while being protected by TheMandalorian and TheRecentlyArrivedBobaFett (TemueraMorrison) and FennecShand (ming-naWen), Who made aDeal with the former to protect Grogu in Exchange for Fett'sArmor (which TheMandalorian obtained from CobbVanth).
Despite TheirBestEfforts, Grogu is captured by Gideon'sDarkTroopers and taken to Gideon'sDarkTroopers cruiser, where Gideon'sDarkTroopers is imprisoned inside aHoldingCell.
Later, GideonWitnessesGrogu using GideonWitnessesGroguForcePowers on TwoStormtroopers that GideonWitnessesGrogu throws around TheCell, before stunning GideonWitnessesGrogu and preparing to take GideonWitnessesGrogu to Dr.Pershing to complete TheBloodTransfusion.
In "chapter 16:
TheRescue", TheMandalorianBoards Gideon'sShip to rescue Grogu, assisted by Cara, Fett, Fennec, Bo-katan, and KoskaReeves (mercedesVarnado).
While Fett provides Cover from Slavei and TheOthers take Control of TheShip'sBridge, TheMandalorian confronts and defeats Gideon.
With Gideon captured and Grogu in TheirCustody, TheMandalorianAndMandalorianAllies have TheMandalorianAndHisAlliesEscapeRoute cut off by aPlatoon of DarkTrooperDroids until LukeSkywalker arrives with R2-d2 and destroys TheDarkTroopers.
When Luke offers to raise and TrainGrogu, TheMandalorian, realizing that TheChild'sDestiny is to become aJedi, reluctantly allows TheChild'sDestiny is to become aJedi to go with Luke.
During anEmotionalFarewell, TheMandalorian removes TheMandalorian helmet to let Grogu see TheMandalorian face for TheFirstTime, and promises to meet TheMandalorian again.
Characterization ==
Physically, Grogu closely resembles Yoda, sharing GroguSignatureGreenSkin and long,PointedEars.
Grogu is small in Size, with WideEyes, ShortHairs, and WrinkledSkin.
Grogu is capable of sitting up, crawling, walking and eating.
Grogu appears capable of understanding SomeLanguage spoken around  Grogu, but cannot speak except in Baby-likeBabbleNoises.
AnthonyBreznican of VanityFair stated: "There is anEmotionalTransference happening here.
TheAudience cares more about TheUnnamed,FacelessMandalorian because  AnthonyBreznican of VanityFair cares so much about BabyYoda."
RebeccaKeegan of TheHollywoodReporter believes Grogu displays aForm of Wisdom despite RebeccaKeegan of TheHollywoodReporter young age, describing RebeccaKeegan of TheHollywoodReporter as "aDalaiLama in ToddlerForm".
JeanneCavelos, FormerNasaAstrophysicist and Author of TheScience of StarWars, also believes Grogu demonstrates Intelligence beyond GroguYears, noting GroguAwareness and Empathy toward Beings even when Beings faces or bodies are covered completely, as well as Grogu ability to recognize Injury in Others and attempt to repair it.
Despite GroguYouth, Grogu demonstrates aConsiderableAbility to use and manipulate TheForce, such as when Grogu lifts TheLargeMudhornCreature into TheAir in "Chapter 2: TheChild", and when Grogu deflects TheFire of anAttackingStormtrooper'sFlamethrower back against Grogu in "Chapter 8: Redemption".
KevinMelrose of ComicBookResources noted that in the original Star Wars trilogy film TheEmpire Strikes Back (1980), LukeSkywalker struggled to lift anX-wingFighter due to anX-wingFighter large size, so TheFact that Grogu can lift HeavyObjects despite GroguDiminutiveSize and YoungAge demonstrates TheVastness of GroguForcePowers.
Grogu also repeatedly shows aDesire to use TheForce to help those around Him, such as when Him attempts to heal TheMandalorian'sWounds in "Chapter 2: TheChild", and when Him heals GreefKarga'sNear-fatalWounds in "Chapter 7:
TheReckoning".
However, after using TheForce in ThisManner,  Grogu is often exhausted and slips into Unconsciousness, indicating that  Grogu is still developing  GroguPower and does not yet have TheSkills to fully control HisPower.
Despite  GroguRawNaturalAbility with TheForce,  Grogu is untrained and still depends heavily on TheMandalorianAndOtherAllies for Protection.
Grogu has aSweetTemperament, and comes across as innocent and kindhearted to most of ThePeople
Grogu encounters, but is also occasionally capable of Violence, such as during aScene in "Chapter 7:
TheReckoning" when  Grogu uses TheForce to choke CaraDune while CaraDune is engaging TheMandalorian in aFriendlyArmWrestlingMatch.
Concept and Creation == ===
Conception ===
Grogu was conceived by Favreau.
Upon learning that Lucasfilm had been sold to TheWaltDisneyCompany in 2012, Favreau began imagining working on aStarWarsProject, and was particularly interested in exploring TheEvents after TheOriginalStarWarsTrilogy.
Favreau conceived  Grogu based upon aDesire to explore TheMystery around YodaAndFavreauSpecies, and anInterest in presenting aCharacter from Yoda'sSpecies at TheBeginning of FavreauJourney, in Contrast to Yoda ending FavreauOwnJourney in Return of TheJedi (1983).
Favreau believed Part of TheAppeal of Yoda was that GeorgeLucas deliberately kept  FavreauOrigins and Details about TheSpecies mysterious, and  Favreau believed ThatSense of Mystery would extend to Grogu: "i think that's why People are so curious about this little one of TheSameSpecies.
In Mid-2017, shortly after  Favreau pitched TheMandalorian to LucasfilmPresidentKathleenKennedy,  Favreau suggested  Favreau meet with DaveFiloni, Who had co-created SeveralStarWarsAnimatedSeries.
Filoni said of FiloniMeeting with  Favreau:When Filoni brought up in TheVeryBeginning of doing ThisChild and having ThisChild be of Yoda'sSpecies, i was like, ‘Oh, that's very tricky, because there's never been this before Outside of Yoda, and then Yaddle in ThePrequels on TheJediCouncil.
it's KindofaSacredThing ...
we just have to be responsible when we're telling aStory with What we're deciding to do.
TheFans want to know Things are aCalculated,CarefulDecision.
Then if You tell aGoodStory, most of TheTime They go with it.
TheCharacter of Grogu was further developed in EarlyConversations between Favreau and Filoni, the latter of Whom drew aRoughSketch of TheCharacter on CocktailNapkins during TheTalks.
MultipleArtists worked to refine TheImage of Grogu created by Filoni, but TheDefinitiveImagery came from aConcept drawing by ArtistChristianAlzmann, which depicted TheCharacter'sMakeshiftGarment.
Favreau said of ThisRendering: "it looked cute, but it also looked a little weird.
That's Part of Yoda.
it can't just be cute.
it can't just be aStraight-upDisneyBaby, it has to be a little bit tweaked.
TheTeam sought to establish Mannerisms and Expressions for Grogu that would remind Viewers of aPet with Whom TheTeam might share aConnection.
TheseCharacteristics include Grogu'sEars, Posture, and TheWay he cocks he head.
DisneyCeoBobiger said of Grogu: "The moment i laid Eyes on TheCharacter, i had aStrongFeeling that Disney was going to connect with Audiences.
So cute, so interesting, so compelling.
So familiar and yet so new.
Favreau has clarified that Grogu is not aYoungerVersion of Yoda Himself, but has declined to comment upon whether Favreau is related to Yoda Himself or otherwise connected to Favreau.
Development ==
Grogu is mostly aWork of Animatronics and Puppetry, although accentuated with Computer-generatedImagery (Cgi).
LegacyEffects, TheSpecialEffectsStudio started by Protégés of SpecialMake-upEffectsCreatorStanWinston, designed TheGroguPuppet and supplied ThePuppeteers to animate TheGroguPuppet during filming.
TheGroguPuppet cost about $5 million to make, and is relatively heavy due to TheAmount of Wires and AnimatronicTechnology inside TheGroguPuppet.
TheGroguPuppet is controlled by TwoTechnicians, one Who operates TheEyes and Mouth and another Who controls OtherFacialExpressions.
There are SeveralStand-inVersions for Grogu used in filming in Addition to ThePrimaryPuppet.
TheCrew of TheMandalorian wanted to use Animatronics for Grogu as often as possible.
However, TheCrew of TheMandalorian also shot Versions of TheCharacter'sScenes both with and without ThePrimaryPuppet, so TheCrew of TheMandalorian had TheOption of replacing it with aCgiEffect in Post-production if ThePrimaryPuppet did not look satisfactory.
When Cgi is used, Favreau said They try to make TheCharacter obey TheSamePhysicalLaws that TheCharacter would if TheCharacter were aPuppet, adding: "i think aLot of Times cg makes cg too obvious where You don't create Parameters creatively that allow TheCharacter to keep TheSameIdentity and Charm. "
TheVoice and Sounds of Grogu were created by DavidAcord and MatthewWood, SoundEditors with SkywalkerSound, Who had previously worked on VariousStarWarsProjects.
DavidAcord recorded Animals'Noises at aWildlifeRescue near SanDiego, and used Recordings of aBat-earedFox and Kinkajou to make TheInitialVersion of Grogu'sVoice.
However, Favreau suggested TheVoice needed to sound more human-like and relatable to Audiences, so instead TheAnimalSounds were scaled back and used only for SmallGrunts and CooingNoises.
ActualInfantVocals were used to create TheNewVersion of Grogu'sVoice, and Acord used aHighly-pitchedVersion of AcordOwnVoice for some of TheMoreArticulatedVocalizations.
Acord also previously voiced Rotta TheHutt, TheYoungHuttlet Son of Jabba TheHutt, in TheAnimatedFilm StarWars: StarWars:.
Filming ===
TheCharacter was referred to as "TheChild" in Screenplays for TheMandalorian, though BryceDallasHoward, Who directed "Chapter 4: Sanctuary", said She always referred to TheCharacter on Set simply as "baby", and OtherCastMembers called it "The Being".
During filming, TheDirector of EachEpisode would communicate with Grogu'sPuppeteers to discuss What was happening in TheScene, What emotions Grogu should express, and What actions TheCharacter should take.
DirectorDeborahChow said in ThisWay, it was similar to providing Direction to aLivingActor.
Favreau encouraged TheDirectors to test and push TheBoundaries of TheGroguPuppet during filming, urging TheDirectors to experiment and attempt to get TheMostRealisticMovements and Mannerisms possible from TheCharacter.
BrendanWayne, aBody double for TheMandalorianCharacter, said ThePuppet looked so realistic that performing against it felt like working with anActualChildActor.
RickFamuyiwa, TheDirector of "Chapter 2: TheChild", said he was shocked when he learned that ThePremiereEpisode of TheMandalorian ended with TheIntroduction of Grogu, because it meant he would be directing TheNextEpisode that further expanded upon TheCharacter.
ThePuppet was popular on Set with TheShow'sCast and Crew.
Chow said: "With TheBaby, every time TheBaby came on Set, TheWholeCrew would respond to TheBaby.
EvenTheGripDepartment, EveryProductionAssistant is coming to TheMonitors, trying to see EvenTheGripDepartment.
Howard screamed in Excitement when  Chow first saw EvenTheGripDepartment, and GinaCarano said of Grogu: "That was our precious.
Our precious is ThisBeing that
Our end up taking Care of in SomeWay.
EmilySwallow said EmilySwallow "fell in Love with it like Everybody else", adding: "i was thrilled when They brought EmilySwallow in ThatLittleBag for TheScene that i got to have with it.
i just wanted to snuggle it."
AmySedaris said TheAnimatronicGroguPuppet made Everyone on TheSet happy: "The minute You looked into BabyYoda'sEyes You just got lost."
Likewise, GiancarloEsposito said GiancarloEsposito enjoyed interacting with TheAnimatronicGroguPuppet during filming: "it melts myHeart, because TheReality is, ThisLittleBaby does Things that You could never imagine and when You look at BabyYoda'sEyes and that little body, how can You not help but fall in Love?"
CarlWeathers has said of GiancarloEsposito:
"CarlWeathers is very interesting and very knowledgeable and very cute.
i never use ThatWord, but ThatWord is aCuteLittleGuy.
ThatWord particularly enjoyed filming Scenes with TheAnimatronicGroguPuppet, which ThatWord called "heartbreakingly beautiful".
ThatWord said directing TheScene between ThatWord and Grogu in "Chapter 3:
TheSin" was "one of TheWeirdest"Moments of HerCareer, because he had soMuchAffection for ThePuppet and was interacting with it like it was aLivingBeing.
Her said: "i literally think that he had forgotten that it's not aReal-liveCreature
and he had fallen in Love with it."
Herzog strongly urged TheMandalorianFilmmakers to use ThePuppet for TheCharacter and NotCgi.
While filming OneScene, DaveFiloni began to remove ThePuppet to shoot anAlternateTake, in Case ThePuppet decided to use aCgiVersion of Grogu in ThePuppet place.
Herzog passionately urged  Herzog not to do so and to remain committed to TheAnimatronics and Puppetry, saying: "You are Cowards.
Leave it. "
Esposito has also said having anActualGroguPuppet to perform against has been beneficial for TheCast, because "ThatSpace allows all of us to be so wowed by ItsPresence".
MistyRosas, Who delivered TheMotionCapturePerformance for Kuiil, often held TheGroguPuppet during  EspositoScenes in "Chapter 7: The Reckoning".
This occasionally proved challenging for Rosas, Who also had to manage TheWeight of TheAnimatronics in HerOwnCostume and FaceMask, as well as TheWeight of GroguProp.
OneFullDay of filming TheEpisode focused upon Kuiil riding TheBlurrgCreature, aProcess Rosas described as "intense" due to TheAmount of Time Her spent on TheFakeCreature and TheSpeeds at which it was made to run.
TheProcess was made furtHer challenging because Her was carrying TheHeavyAnimatronicGroguPuppet throughout TheScenes, and Her occasionally needed Breaks between Takes.
Rosas said: "myLegs are not exactly long, so i was squeezing for DearLife and holding TheBaby."
Nevertheless,  Rosas said  Rosas enjoyed working with GroguCharacter, saying: " Rosas just melts myHeart,  Rosas's so cute. "
TheOpeningScene of "Chapter 8: Redemption", anImperialScoutTrooper portrayed by ComedianAdamPally punched Grogu.
During TheFirstTake of filming TheScene, ComedianAdamPally punched TheAnimatronicGroguPuppet hard, prompting Favreau to inform TheActor that TheAnimatronicGroguPuppet cost about $5 million to make.
This made ComedianAdamPally so nervous that ComedianAdamPally missed Grogu altogether when ComedianAdamPally tried to punch ComedianAdamPally in the three subsequent takes.
Pally joked about working with Grogu:
"i gotta tell You, TheTruth is that BabyYoda is aBit of aDiva.
BabyYoda's constantly vaping."
At SomePoint during Filming of TheMandalorian, GeorgeLucas visited TheSet and held TheGroguPuppet.
Favreau posted aPicture of Lucas holding Grogu on Instagram on January 16, 2020, which drew ConsiderableInternetAttention.
Prerelease ===
Grogu was kept secret and was deliberately withheld from TheMandalorian'sPrereleaseMarketingAndMerchandisePlans due to TheRisk that Details about TheCharacter could leak before TheShow aired.
Favreau said of ThisPlan: "i think ThatPart of What People really value is to be surprised and delighted, and i think that's becoming all too rare."
Favreau has credited DonaldGlover as TheSource of ThatStrategy.
While developing TheMandalorian, Favreau was simultaneously directing Glover in ThePhotorealisticRemake of TheLionKing (2019).
While discussing MusicAndPopCulture, Glover told Favreau that People enjoy being surprised, because TrueSurprises had become much less common in TheInternetEra.
As anExample, Glover cited TheExcitement generated by TheSuddenReleases of SurpriseAlbums by SingerAndSongwriterBeyoncé.
Favreau felt keeping Grogu a secret until  Favreau was revealed would allow Fans to connect with TheCharacter and "discover TheStory as it was unfolding".
TheLeadershipAndMarketingTeam at TheWaltDisneyCompany was supportive of ThisStrategy.
Screeners of ThePilotEpisode were not distributed to Reviewers to avoid Leaks about Grogu, and TheOfficialLucasfilmAndStarWarsSocialMediaAccounts did not start posting Messages about Grogu until about a week after TheSeries debuted, to avoid spoiling TheCharacter'sDebut as much as possible.
Themes == ===
Parenting and Fatherhood ===
One of ThePrimaryThemes of TheMandalorian is Parenting and Fatherhood, particularly through TheFather-sonRelationship dynamic between TheMandalorian and Grogu.
RyanBritt of Fatherly wrote: "For Years TheStarWarsFranchise avoided depicting aParent-childDynamic.
With Mando and BabyYoda, that’s finally changing."
VultureWriterKathrynVanarendonk argued that Parenting has been TheSubject of PastStarWarsStories, but almost always during LaterStages of Parenthood, rather than an infant in EarlyDevelopmentalStages such as Grogu.
As Examples, VultureWriterKathrynVanarendonk cited Obi-wanKenobi serving as aMentor to TheAdolescentAnakinSkywalker, PrincessLeia lamenting over VultureWriterKathrynVanarendonk grown Son KyloRen, or TheAbsence of Rey'sParents.
SeveralReviewers have compared the dynamic between Grogu and TheMandalorian to LoneWolf and Cub, aManga about aSamuraiWarrior and LoneWolf young son.
Grogu makes TheMandalorian a softer and more relatable character; Grogu changes in aPositiveWay because of raising Grogu, becoming less selfish and self-absorbed.
SeveralExamples of TheMandalorianParentingGrogu appear throughout TheSeries, such as when Grogu stops Grogu from pressing RandomButtons in TheCockpit of TheMandalorian'sSpaceship, ultimately by holding Grogu in GroguLap.
In AnotherExample, the Mandalorian sets up aCarSeat for Grogu in TheCockpit of HisShip, so his can be seated safely and comfortably during TheirTravels.
TheRelationship between TheMandalorian and Grogu is anExample of UnexpectedFatherhood.
Mandalorian feels aConnection and ParentalBond with Grogu because of MandalorianOwnChildhood, when Mandalorian was orphaned upon TheDeath of MandalorianParents and was adopted by TheMandalorianCulture as a"foundling".
Nevertheless, Fatherhood was not aRole TheMandalorian was initially seeking, and Fatherhood makes RepeatedInitialAttempts to avoid ThisResponsibility.
Fatherhood first does so in "Chapter 3:
TheSin", when Fatherhood leaves Grogu with TheClient, and then again in "Chapter 4: Sanctuary", when Fatherhood plans to leave Grogu with Omera, aProtectiveMother on ThePlanet Sorgan Who is willing to take Grogu into GroguOwnFamily.
TheMandalorian does not fully commit to TheRole of Fatherhood until TheFirst-seasonFinale, "chapter 8: Redemption", when Grogu Himself is also adopted into TheMandalorianCulture as a"foundling" and TheMandalorian is formally declared to be Grogu Himself father figure.
AnthonyBreznican of VanityFair has noted that None of the Day-to-Day difficulties of Parenthood are portrayed in TheSeries: "There is no shrill squawking from BabyYoda, noTantrum, noSpit-up, no uncontrollable shrieking that burrows into aParent’sPsyche like aDentist’sDrill shredding aSoft,PinkNerve."
Likewise, VultureWriterKathrynVanarendonk said AnthonyBreznican of VanityFair ignores or does not address ManyParentingDetails that make Fatherhood difficult, such as What Grogu Himself eats, when VultureWriterKathrynVanarendonk goes to Sleep, and whether VultureWriterKathrynVanarendonk wears Diapers.
She wrote: "TheMandalorian is uninterested in Diapers, and so Mando gets to be aVeryParticularImage of Fatherhood: TheGuy Who doesn't have to sweat TheSmallStuff."
Vananderonk described this as aWishFulfillmentFantasy for Parents or prospective Parents: "aVision of Parenting stripped so thoroughly of AllDetail and Specificity that all that’s left are Archetypes: TheParent, TheChild".
Grogu encounters aHandful of OtherProtectorFigures throughout TheFirstSeason, including Omera, IG-11, and PeliMotto.
SomeObservers have criticized TheSeries for TheFact that TheMandalorian repeatedly leaves Grogu alone or in TheHands of RelativeStrangers, as well as for making Decisions that place Grogu in Danger.
OneExample is in "Chapter 6:
ThePrisoner", when he allows aTeam of DangerousMercenaries to use he Ship while Grogu is on Board, nearly resulting in Grogu'sDeath.
anInteraction TheMandalorian has with PeliMotto in "Chapter 5:
TheGunslinger" is one of TheMostOvertDiscussions about TheChallenges of caring for Grogu.
When TheMandalorian accidentally wakes Grogu, Who had been sleeping in Peli'sArms, TheMandalorian chides Him: "Do You have AnyIdea
how long it took me to get it to sleep?
She also condemns TheMandalorian for leaving Grogu alone on TheShip, saying: "You have anAwfulLot to learn about raising a Young one".
ScreencrushWriterMattSinger argued TheMandalorian'sParentingErrors make TheShow that much more appealing and relatable because making Mistakes is aLargePart of being aParent.
Good and Evil; nature versus Nurture ===
OneScene in "Chapter 7:
TheReckoning" led ManyFans to reevaluate Grogu and question whether Grogu may demonstrate EvilTendencies.
During aScene on TheMandalorian'sSpaceship, Grogu observes as TheMandalorian and CaraDune engage in aFriendlyArmWrestlingMatch.
During TheContest, Grogu uses TheForce to choke Cara, nearly strangling Cara to Death before TheMandalorian intervenes.
Throughout TheStarWarsFranchise, ThatAbility has been most commonly associated with TheDarkSide of TheForce, and particularly with TheAntagonistCharacter DarthVader.
SarahBeaMilner of ScreenRant wrote: "TheMoment is genuinely shocking — and more than a little disturbing."
SomeReviewers noted, however, that Grogu likely mistakenly believed TheMandalorian was in Danger and intervened to help.
Additionally, in TheSameEpisode, Grogu uses TheForce to heal and save GreefKarga, aPower typically associated with TheLightSide.
PeterFoy of ComicBookResources wrote: "it doesn't exactly seem realistic that Disney would blow DisneyMerchandisingPotential with TheLittleCutie by going AllDamien (theOmen) in PeterFoy of ComicBookResources storyline.
"Nevertheless , SomeWriters have suggested Viewers had been underestimating Grogu'sCapacity for Evil because he is cute.
Fans speculated Grogu could be presenting aFalsePersonality or using TheForce to manipulate People into caring about Grogu to help ensure GroguSurvival.
EsquireWriterMattMiller noted that Yoda lied about YodaIdentity during YodaInitialAppearance in The Empire Strikes Back, posing as aSimple-mindedObserver to LukeSkywalker before revealing Yoda to be aJediMaster.
EsquireWriterMattMiller suggested Grogu could be putting on aSimilarPerformance.
OneFanTheory suggests Grogu could be related to aProphecy in aPastStarWarsWork that predicted anEvil that could consume TheGalaxy.
TheProphecy, described in TheNovelStarWars: Master and Apprentice (2019), says: "TheDanger of ThePast is not past, but sleeps in anEgg.
When the egg cracks,
TheProphecy, described in TheNovelStarWars: Master and Apprentice (2019) will threaten TheGalaxyEntire. "
Fans theorized this could refer to Grogu, Who sleeps in anEgg-likeBassinet in TheMandalorian.
Others have theorized TheReason TheImperialRemnant wants Grogu is to turn Him over to TheDarkSide of TheForce, or for Use as aWeapon.
MoffGideon in TheSeasonFinale says, "You may think You have SomeIdea What You’re in Possession of, but You do not."
PeterFoy of ComicBookResources suggested this could allude to Grogu'sPotential to cause MassDestruction.
CaitlinGallagher of Bustle suggested rather than building toward Grogu becoming evil, TheShow could be suggesting the Mandalorian needs to find aWay to raise Grogu in aLessViolentEnvironment.
All season long, Grogu has witnessed those around Grogu committing ViolentActs.
For Example, VultureWriterKeithPhipps noticed that when Ig-11 kills MultipleStormtroopers in Front of VultureWriterKeithPhipps, Grogu has a"look of Wonder" in VultureWriterKeithPhipps Eyes, which VultureWriterKeithPhipps said "is hilarious, but also a little chilling".
SomeWriters applied aNature versus nurture Argument to this, contending Grogu is becoming violent because of What Grogu is learning based on TheActions around Grogu.
This suggests Grogu is not inherently good or evil, but that instead, like AllChildren, Grogu is impressionable and does not fully understand TheEvents occurring around Grogu.
he is learning about Life and needs Guidance as he develops he abilities.
This is why he uses ForcePowers generally associated with BothTheLightAndDarkSides of TheForce.
it will largely fall to TheMandalorian to provide ThisGuidance, as when TheMandalorian stops he from strangling Cara.

Grogu on Wookieepedia,
aStarWarsWikiCaptainPhasma is aFictionalCharacter in TheStarWarsFranchise, portrayed by EnglishActressGwendolineChristie.
Introduced in StarWars:
TheForce Awakens (2015), TheFirstFilm in TheStarWars sequel Trilogy
, Phasma is TheCommander of TheFirstOrder'sForce of Stormtroopers.
Christie returned to TheRole in the next of TheTrilogy'sFilms, Star Wars: TheLastJedi (2017), and in TheAnimatedTelevisionSeries StarWarsResistance (2018) and SeveralVideoGames.
TheCharacter also made anAdditionalAppearance in Before TheAwakening, an anthology book set before TheEvents of The Force Awakens.
j.j.Abrams created Phasma from anArmorDesign originally developed for KyloRen and named Her after The1979HorrorFilm Phantasm.
TheCharacter was originally conceived as Male.
Phasma appeared prominently in Promotion and Marketing for The Force Awakens, but TheCharacter's UltimatelyMinorRole in TheFilm was TheSubject of Criticism, aComplaint repeated for HerAppearance in TheLastJedi.
Nonetheless, Merchandise featuring TheCharacter found Success, and HerFigure was TheBest-selling of AllTheForce
Awakens ActionFigures on Amazon.co.uk.
Concept and Creation ==
TheCharacter'sCreation was inspired by aRejectedDesign for KyloRen.
CostumeDesignerMichaelKaplan came up with TheConcept of Kylo being "theLord of TheStormtroopers, in BrightShiningSilverArmor".
CostumeDesignerMichaelKaplan had aStrongImage in  CostumeDesignerMichaelKaplan head of What ThisConcept should look like, which concept
ArtistDermotPower turned into anIllustration.
ThisImage, however, was immediately rejected by Directorj.j.Abrams.
Later, ProducerKathleenKennedy found TheDesign, reacting positively and calling TheDesign "fantastic".
Directorj.j.Abrams then used TheDesign to create aNewCharacter, Phasma.
he named Phasma after The1979HorrorFilm Phantasm because PhantasmArmor reminded Kaplan of The1979HorrorFilm Phantasm'sSpheres.
Kaplan intended for TheVisuals of TheFirstOrder to contrast with that of TheResistance, appearing in Colors like "black, teal blue, and steel gray", with Stormtroopers being updated to be more simplified and modernized.
Kaplan designed TheCharacter believing it would be "extremely cool" to have aSilverArmoredCharacter in The1979HorrorFilm Phantasm.
TheCharacter was not originally conceived as aWoman, but rather was changed from Male to feMale during Casting, less than three weeks before PrincipalShooting began.
Phasma thereby became the second on-Screen female Star Wars villain, after ZamWesell.
With Phasma, TheFilmmakers wished to "push TheBoundaries" of TraditionalRoles for FemaleCharacters.
ActressGwendolineChristie, Who had previously played Brienne of Tarth in Game of Thrones, was first officially confirmed as CaptainPhasma in aVanityFairSpread released May 4, 2015, following ItsLeak.
Christie fought heavily to appear in TheFilm, continually insisting ChristieAgent get Christie aPart in HerAgent.
Christie was not aware that TheCharacter was originally aMan.
Christie took Inspiration from  ChristieArmor—"it's very high-functioning, it's very imposing
and it's not malleable at all"—in how to play TheCharacter.
In playing Phasma,  Christie felt encouraged to experiment more with TheGesture of aCharacter.
HerInitialCostume, used in The Force Awakens, had to be created over aPeriod of "fourorFiveDays"; Co-costumeDesignerDaveCrossman described Co-costumeDesignerDaveCrossman physical creation as "aCompletePanic".
it took Christie RoughlyForty-fiveMinutes to put on.
aNewSuit was created for TheLastJedi, with VariousTweaks.
ItsHelmet was re-chromed, TheFit was altered, and TheArmor was made "much cleaner and shinier."
Character ==
TheCommander of TheFirstOrder'sStormtroopers, CaptainPhasma is described as a"toughVeteranCommander" and one of a"commandingTriumvirate" of TheFirstOrder alongside KyloRen and GeneralHux.
Christie compared CaptainPhasma to BobaFett in TheSense of being aCharacter Who, while not "at TheForefront of TheAction AllTheTime", still has "aLot of Impact".
TheActress called TheCharacter "aMalevolentForce" Who takes Pleasure in TheActress cruelty, Something TheActress attributed to aPerceivedDifficultJourney to becoming TheOnlyFemaleStormtrooper of Rank.
To contrast with OtherStormtroopers in TheFranchise, Christie portrayed Phasma with BothSomeFemininity and Sassiness.
GlenRobertGill, writing for BrightLightsFilmJournal, saw Phasma as "TheDemonicorNegativeEmanation of TheMaidenlyAnima".
Phasma is depicted wearing SalvagedChromiumArmor, which in TheForceAwakens'VisualDictionary is established as coming from aNabooYacht once owned by Palpatine.
it is said to serve "primarily as aSymbol of PastPower".
Christie recognised TheCharacter'sHelmet as both being futuristic and having MedievalElements.
ChrisLaverty, Creator of CostumeAnalysisSiteClothes on Film, called HerArmor "ProbablyTheMostRegalCostume" in TheForce Awakens, and noted HerArmor "ProbablyTheMostRegalCostume" in TheForce Awakens as aReflection of HerStatus.
he also felt HerCloak, "elegantly slung over OneShoulder", was aMethod of humanizing TheCharacter.
In-Universe, HerCloak is The"traditionalCape of FirstOrderCommand".
GillArmor called to MindMirrors, symbols of "Self-reflection and Self-examination", TheFeelings Gill brings in Finn when Gill inadvertently helps inspire Him to defect.

Reception ==
Phasma received Attention before Release.
Before PhasmaName was confirmed, Phasma had been dubbed "the Chrometrooper" by Fans.
TheTrademarking of "captainPhasma" led to Speculation that it was TheName of Christie'sRumoredCharacter, said to be anImperialOfficer pursuing Finn. "
CaptainPhasma" had been TheName of aCharacter in OneStarWarsFanfic, Tarkin'sFist, leading to Movieweb
wondering if it was anIntentionalHomage.
IGN's "Keepin' itReel" podcast discussed ThePossibility of Phasma being "theNextBreakoutBaddie" in TheVein of BobaFett and DarthMaul.
They responded positively to TheCharacter'sName, despite SomeInitialMisgivings, for fitting in with the franchise's Flash Gordon roots.

They similarly had HighHopes for Christie'sActing.
During TheLead-up to TheFilm, Phasma became a fan favorite.

JesseSchedeen of Ign called Phasma "something of aDisappointment in The Force Awakens", negatively contrasting Her against Fett in that "EvenFett had TheDistinction of outsmarting HanSolo before meeting anIgnominiousEnd".

MaxNicholson, writing for Collider, noted TheAmount of Hype for TheCharacter, as well as  SchedeenMinimalRole in TheStory.
MaxNicholson suggested that Hux and Phasma should have been merged into OneCharacter, as Hux and Phasma were too similar, or Phasma should have been given TheMeleeFightScene given to aTrooper nicknamed "TR-8R" by Fans.

Christie'sCharacter Brienne of Tarth further criticized Phasma'sRole in TheForce Awakens by attributing TheFirstOrder'sDefeat to being largely HerFault, as well as Her"recycled"Appearance in TheLastJedi.
Merchandise featuring TheCharacter proved popular.
DavidBetancourt of TheWashingtonPost called Phasma'sRole in TheFilm "little more than aShinyNewProp", viewing  DavidBetancourt of TheWashingtonPost as aVictim of TheFilm's need to introduce all TheFilm NewCharacters, yet noted ThePopularity and Rarity of TheMerchandise surrounding TheCharacter.

aLeitmotif is aRecurrentMusicalPhrase associated with Characters or Events in aDrama.
= Use in StarWars ==
"TheImperialMarch" is sometimes referred to simply as "DarthVader'sTheme.
In TheMovies (except for TheOriginalStarWars), TheMarch is often played when DarthVader's appears.
it is also played during Palpatine'sArrival on TheDeathStar in Return of TheJedi, though it does segue into TheEmperor'sOwnTheme as TheEmperor appears.
OriginalTrilogy ===
"TheImperialMarch" is first heard in The Empire Strikes Back in LowPiccolos as TheGalacticEmpire sends ProbeDroids across TheGalaxy in Search of LukeSkywalker.
ItsMajorOpening occurs as Imperial-classStarDestroyers amass and DarthVader is first presented in TheFilm, 19Minutes into TheMovie.
TheThemeAndRelatedMotifs are also incorporated into Tracks such as "theBattle of Hoth" and "theAsteroidField".
Return of TheJedi makes SimilarUse of TheTheme, though  Return of TheJedi final statement is significantly different, making QuietUse of aHarp as aRedeemedAnakinSkywalker dies in AnakinSkywalker Son'sArms.
trilogy ===
"TheImperialMarch" appears on aFewOccasions in ThePrequelTrilogy, most often used to foreshadow AnakinSkywalker'sFuture as DarthVader.
anInnocentTheme for TheNine-year-oldAnakin in ThePhantomMenace is thematically based on "TheImperialMarch".
" TheImperialMarch" is also heard towards TheEnd, as Yoda acknowledges Anakin as Obi-wan'sApprentice in saying "The Chosen One, TheBoy may be.
Nevertheless, GraveDanger i fear in TheBoyTraining".
it is also heard softly at TheEnd of TheFinalCreditRoll, where it fades into TheCharacter'sSignatureBreathing, showing that TheRest of ThePrequelTrilogy will reveal how Anakin became DarthVader.
In TheSecondPrequel,  Attack of TheClones, "TheImperialMarch" is sometimes played subtly when anEvent foreshadows Anakin'sFuture: it is first played when Yoda senses Anakin slaughtering aTribe of TuskenRaiders to avenge AnakinMother'sDeath and later with MoreForce when Anakin tells PadméAmidala What Anakin did.
it is played most prominently and recognizably during TheFinalSequence when CloneTroopers assemble and depart Coruscant, foreshadowing that CloneTroopers will become TheImperialStormtroopers.
Although "Across TheStars" is featured most prominently in TheFilm'sEndCredits, SeveralNotes from "TheImperialMarch" are heard beneath TheFilm near TheEnd.
In Revenge of TheSith "TheImperialMarch" is first played when Anakin rebukes TheJediCouncil for denying Anakin TheRank of JediMaster, although appointing Anakin to TheJediCouncil.
TheTrack can also be heard when Anakin tells MaceWindu about DarthSidious'TrueIdentity.
it is later played when Anakin is dubbed as TheSithDarthVader, shortly after TheDeath of MaceWindu. "
TheImperialMarch" is quoted when CloneTroopers find DeadWookiees on Kashyyyk and when Padmé confronts Anakin on Mustafar.
aFewNotes of The"march" are played when Vader arrives on Mustafar to kill TheSeparatists.
ThePiece is played more clearly during the "Battle of TheHeroes" scene between Obi-wan and DarthVader at TheMovie'sClimax and in TheSimultaneousBattle between Yoda and Sidious.
ThePiece is also played when DarthVader receives DarthVader armor and when DarthVader looks up at TheFirstDeathStar.
SequelTrilogy ===
In The2015StarWars: TheForce Awakens, TwoBars from TheBrassMotif of "theImperialMarch" are played after AntagonistKyloRen clutches TheCharredRemains of DarthVader'sHelmet, vowing to finally succeed where TheGalacticEmpire failed.
In The2017StarWars: The Last Jedi, TheTrack was briefly played after SupremeLeaderSnoke compares AntagonistKyloRen to DarthVader's, saying KyloRen saw ThePotential of "A new DarthVader's.
" In The2019StarWars: TheRise of Skywalker
TheTrack is present in TheScenes where TheMask of DarthVader is shown, when DarthSidious first reveals TheFinalOrder, aMassiveArmada of Xyston-classStarDestroyers designed by TheSithEternal, to KyloRen, and when Rey seeks TheSithWayfinder in TheDeathStar'sWreckage.
StarWarsAnthology ===
Trailers for Rogue One:
aStarWarsStory featured TheTrack prominently; TheFirstNotes of "TheImperialMarch" can be heard at TheEnd of TheTrailer as TheLetters turn to reveal TheName of TheUpcomingMovie.
Prior to this, DarthVader can be heard Breathing and DarthVader appearance is seen as aReflection on TheFloor.
In TheFilm proper, scored by MichaelGiacchino, TheTheme can be heard when DarthVader emerges from DarthVader sanctum to confer with DirectorOrsonKrennic, and again after DarthVader warns DirectorOrsonKrennic about overstepping DarthVader bounds.
TheTheme can be heard once more when Vader attacks TheRebelSoldiers trapped in aHallway; it is slowed down enough not to be obvious and married with aChorus reminiscent of that from Revenge of TheSith.
TheTheme is finally heard outright when Vader witnesses TheTantiveiv fleeing into Hyperspace.
TheTrack appears early in Solo:
aStarWarsStory as DiegeticMusic in TheCorelliaSpaceport as Part of a commercial encouraging Viewers to join TheImperialNavy, encouraging HanSolo to enlist as HisTicket off ThePlanet.
ThisBriefAppearance marks the first and thus-far only in-Universe appearance of "TheImperialMarch" in aTheatricalFilm.

In May 2015, Williams said Williams would reuse Themes from ThePreviousFilms, such as those for Luke, Leia and Han, in Ways that "will seem very natural and right in TheMoments for which we've chosen to do TheseKinds of Quotes.
There aren't many of TheseKinds of Quotes, but there are a few that i think are important and will seem very much a part of TheFabric of ThePiece in aPositiveAndConstructiveWay."

Time will tell.
What i do know is that it's one of TheBestScores i've heard in aWhile.
" Udiscover gave TheScore aPositiveReview, saying, "TheExpansive,DramaticPassages are as full-bodied as One would hope for aFilm as epic as The Force Awakens, but TheAttention to Detail within TheScore – and TheExquisitelyRecordedPerformance – make TheResults a subtle and engaging listen. "

WilhuffTarkin is aFictionalCharacter in TheStarWarsFranchise, introduced in TheOriginal1977StarWarsFilm (played by PeterCushing) as TheMainAntagonist.
In TheOriginal1977StarWarsFilm (played by PeterCushing), WilhuffTarkin is depicted as TheCommander of TheDeathStar, TheGalacticEmpire'sDwarf Planet-sizedBattleStation, and one of TheHighest-rankingOfficers in TheGalacticEmpire's, even outranking Vader.
he orders TheDestruction of ThePlanetAlderaan by TheStation'sSuperlaser, and is killed at TheEnd of TheFilm, when LukeSkywalker destroys TheDeathStar.
Outside of TheFilm, Tarkin has made Appearances in VariousCanonAndNon-canonStarWarsMedia, including TheAnimatedSeries TheCloneWars, Rebels, and TheBadBatch, and TheFilms Revenge of TheSith and Rogue One.
Tarkin is also TheProtagonist of The2014NovelTarkin, which details TheCharacter'sBackstory and rise to Power within TheEmpire'sRanks.
In TheNovel, Tarkin advocates for TheTarkinDoctrine, anEntirelyFear-basedMilitarySystem in which TheEmpire uses LargeNumbers of intimidating CapitalShips and StrikeFighters to seem undefeatable, so that noOne would dare to try and rise up against it.
HisPhilosophy of "ruling through Fear of Force" becomes central to ImperialPolicy and earns HisThePosition of TheFirstGrandMoff in TheEmpire.
Tarkin'sCharacter has been well-received, and Tarkin'sCharacter has been called "one of TheMostFormidableVillains in StarWarsHistory."
Concept and Creation ==
GrandMoffTarkin'sCharacter was originally conceived as aHolyMan from ThePlanet Aquila, but was changed later in TheCreativeProcess into anAntagonist.
As TheEmperor would not appear until later in TheOriginalTrilogy, Lucas used Tarkin'sFinalVersion as The"mainVillain" of TheFirstFilm, aPersonification of TheEmpire.
According to aBook created to help promote TheOriginalFilm to ProspectiveTheaters, TheEmperor aspires to become TheEmperor.
Portrayals ===
During TheProduction of StarWars, PeterCushing found Tarkin'sBoots, furnished by TheWardrobeDepartment, to be very uncomfortable.
DirectorGeorgeLucas agreed to limit Shots where PeterCushing'sFeet would be visible, allowing DirectorGeorgeLucas to wear Slippers.
Cushing admitted many years later to not knowing What a"grandMoff" actually was, joking that it sounded like "Something which infests aClothesCloset" and decided to play Him as a"deeplyCrossAndUnpleasantGentleman".
In The2005PrequelFilm Revenge of TheSith, WaynePygram was able to achieve TheLikeness of aYoungVersion of Tarkin through TheUse of ProstheticMakeup.
For HisPerformance as Tarkin in TheAnimatedSeries TheCloneWars, VoiceActorStephenStanton researched Cushing'sPerformances and then tried to imitate What Cushing might have sounded like in VoiceActorStephenStanton mid-thirties and soften VoiceActorStephenStanton voice to portray aLevel of Humanity.
In The2016AnthologyFilm RogueOne, ArchiveFootage and aDigitalScan of CushingLifeMask made for The1984Film TopSecret!
were used to create a3dCgiMask which was augmented and mapped to ActorGuyHenry'sFace.
Henry had studied Cushing'sMannerisms many years previously for TheLeadRole in BritishtvShowYoungSherlock, but insisted on aScreenTest as  Henry was not comfortable that  HenryVocalImitation was accurate, stating  Henry sounded more "peterO'toole than PeterCushing".
TheIlmTeam searched through Hours of Footage to find SuitableMaterial of Cushing to build from, Footage from aNewHope was lit very differently to TheLighting used in RogueOne and had to be digitally changed.
TheMoreTheManipulatedTheLighting used in RogueOne to match TheOtherActors in TheScenes the less like Cushing TheCharacterModel looked, which meant creating aBalancingAct between "aDigitalFigure" and "one Who looked precisely like Cushing".
TheOwners of Cushing'sEstate were heavily involved with TheCreation and had Input right down to "small,SubtleAdjustments".
TheResult, which has been called "one of TheMostComplexAndCostlyCgiRe-creations ever", received aMixedResponse, with Questions being raised about TheMorality of using aDeadActor'sLikeness.

PublicationHistory ==
=== 1976–1987 : Early films and television series
TheFirstStarWarsSpinoffMaterial was StarWars:
From TheAdventures of LukeSkywalker (1976), the novelization of The1977Film.
Lucas later commissioned AlanDeanFoster, Who ghostwrote  From TheAdventures of LukeSkywalker (1976), TheNovelization of The1977Film, to write aSequel, which resulted in Splinter of TheMind'sEye (1978).
Lucas originally intended to use this as TheBasis for aPotentialLow-budgetSequel to StarWars, but when this became one of TheMostSuccessfulFilms of AllTime, Lucas decided to write LucasOwnStory for TheFilmSequel, The Empire Strikes Back (1980).
While this was in Production, Lucas approved TheStarWarsHolidaySpecial (1978), WithWhichLucasHadLimitedInvolvement.
Running from April 1977 to May 1986, TheStarWarsComicBookSeries from MarvelComics met with SuchStrongSales that former Marvel editor-in-Chief Jim Shooter credited it with saving Marvel financially in 1977 and 1978.
TheStarWarsComicBookSeries from MarvelComics became one of TheIndustry'sTopSellingTitles in 1979 and 1980.
anAdaptation of TheThirdTheatricalFilm, Return of TheJedi, was released as aSeparateFour-issueLimitedSeries (1983–1984).twoNovelTrilogies with OriginalStorylines were written, TheHanSoloAdventures by BrianDaley (1979–1980), and 1983'sTheAdventures of LandoCalrissian by l.NeilSmith.
BrianDaley also wrote RadioDramatizations of TheOriginalTrilogy, which aired in 1981, 1983, and 1996.
TheFirstStarWarsElectronicGame was released in 1979 by Kenner, followed by aHandful of AtariAndParkerBrothersVideoGames in TheEarly1980s, mainly adaptations of FilmScenes.

=== 1987–1991
: "The Dark Times" ===
Following TheSeries'10thAnniversary, TheRelease of StarWarsSpin-offMedia was largely halted.
In 1987, TheFanNewsletterBanthaTracks was absorbed by TheOfficialLucasfilmMagazine, which focused on TheCompany'sProjects outside of StarWars.
SomeFans feared that TheFranchise had come to anEnd, and ThePeriod between 1987 and 1991 has been called the "Dark Times.
There were SomeBrightSpots in ThisEra, however.
In 1987, WestEndGames began publishing StarWars: TheRoleplayingGame, and TheSubsequentAncillaryRole-playingGameMaterial such as Sourcebooks, Gamebooks, and AdventureModules.
These have been called "the first publications to expand greatly beyond What was known from TheVintageEra of TheMovies," and would serve as aResource for aNumber of FranchiseNovelists.
== 1991–1996:
ThrawnNovels and DarkEmpireComics ==
TheLack of NewStarWarsMaterial ended with The1991Release of TimothyZahn'sNovelHeir to DarkEmpire.
Heir to DarkEmpire, which reached #1 on TheNewYorkTimesBestSellerList, began What would become aLargeCollection of Works set before, between, and especially after TheOriginalFilms.
Starwars.com wrote in 2014 that TheNovel "jumpstarted aPublishingProgram that endures to ThisDay and formalized TheExpandedUniverse".
Starwars.com introduced, among Others, ThePopularCharacters GrandAdmiralThrawn and MaraJade, and was followed by TheSequels DarkForce Rising (1992) and The Last Command (1993).
TheThrawnTrilogy is widely credited with revitalizing TheStarWarsFranchise.
In TheSecretHistory of StarWars, MichaelKaminski suggests ThisRenewedInterest was aFactor in Lucas'sDecision to create ThePrequelTrilogy.
Around ThisSameTime, TheComicsLicense was transferred to DarkHorseComics, Who launched aNumber of Series set after TheOriginalFilmTrilogy, including ThePopularDarkEmpireSequence (1991–1995) by TomVeitch and CamKennedy.
The comic launched months after TheFirstThrawnNovel and was aSequel to ThoseNovels; TheFirstThrawnNovel notably resurrected TheFilmCharacters EmperorPalpatine and BobaFett.
Zahn was critical of TheConcept of resurrecting EmperorPalpatine through ClonedBodies, feeling TheConcept of resurrecting EmperorPalpatine through ClonedBodies undermined and contradicted TheMeaning of TheEnding of Return of TheJedi.
TheJediPrinceSeries of Young-readerNovels, released between 1992 and 1993, depicts Luke, Leia, and Han about a year after Return of TheJeditheJedi.
TheTruce at Bakura (1993) depicts TheImmediateAftermath of TheAforementionedFilm.
In 1993, DarkHorse published Tales of TheJedi, expanding TheFictionalUniverse to TheTime of TheOldRepublic, approximately 4,000 years before TheFilms.
TheSeries spawned ManyOtherProductions, including Books, FurtherComics, and EventuallyTheKnights of TheOldRepublicComputerRoleplayingGames.
In 1994, LucasLicensing'sAllanKausch and SueRostoni discussed TheRelationship between Lucas'Creations and TheDerivativeWorks by OtherAuthors:
Gospel, or Canon as we refer to it, includes TheScreenplays, TheFilms, TheRadioDramas and TheNovelizations.
TheseWorks spin out of GeorgeLucas'OriginalStories, TheRest are written by OtherWriters.
However, between us, Us've read Everything, and much of it is taken into Account in TheOverallContinuity.
TheEntireCatalog of PublishedWorks comprises aVastHistory—with ManyOff-shoots, Variations and Tangents—like AnyOtherWell-developedMythology.
=== 1996–1999 :
SpecialEditions and Shadows of TheEmpire ===
The1996StevePerryNovelShadows of TheEmpire, set in TheAs-yet-unexploredTimePeriod between The Empire Strikes Back and Return of TheJedi, was Part of aMultimediaCampaign that also included aComicBookSeries and VideoGame.
TheMultimediaProject was largely meant to reinvigorate TheFranchise ahead of ThePrequelTrilogy, along with Lucas's1997SpecialEditions of TheOriginalTrilogy.
Lucas incorporated Elements of TheExpandedUniverse into TheSpecialEditions; for Example, Coruscant, TheNewRepublicCapitalPlanet created by Zahn in TheThrawnTrilogy, made ItsFilmDebut in TheSpecialEdition of Return of TheJedi, before being featured more heavily in ThePrequelTrilogy.
anEponymousComicBookSeries, LaterSubtitledRepublic, launched in 1998 and introduced Ki-adi-mundi ahead of HisAppearance in TheFilms.
In 1999, StarWarsBookPublishing moved from BantamSpectra to DelReyBooks.
aNewSeries set between 25 and 30 years after TheOriginalFilms, TheNewJediOrder (1999–2003), was written by MultipleAuthors and introduced aNewThreat: TheYuuzhanVong, aPowerfulAlienRace attempting to invade and conquer TheEntireGalaxy.
TheFirstNovel in TheSeries, r.a.Salvatore'sVectorPrime, killed off PopularCharacterChewbacca.
=== 1999–2014
:Prequel FilmTrilogy and TheCloneWars ===
Before 1999, TheBulk of ExpandedUniverseStorytelling explored TheTimePeriods either after Return of TheJedi or long before aNewHope (E.g.TheTales of TheJedi series).
TheTimePeriod shortly before TheOriginalTrilogy (including TheRise of TheGalacticEmpire and ThePersonalHistories of AnakinSkywalker and EmperorPalpatine) was left open for Lucas to develop in TheForm of aPrequelTrilogy, which begin with Episodei: ThePhantomMenace (1999).
TheCharacter AaylaSecura, introduced in 2000 in TheRepublicComicBookSeries, appears in Episode II:
Attack of TheClones (2002).
The2003AnimatedSeries CloneWars and VariousSpin-offBooks, Comics, and VideoGames explore TheTitularConflict in MoreDetail leading up to Episode III: Revenge of TheSith (2005).
Ahead of TheFilm'sRelease, Lucas announced a3d"continuation" of CloneWars, which was released as TheAnimatedFilm The CloneWars (2008) and aTelevisionSeries of TheSameName (2008–2014).
These reveal that Anakin had aPadawanLearner, AhsokaTano, during ThisPeriod.
VariousCharacters seen only briefly in TheFilms or in OtherSpin-offMaterial are featured in MoreDepth.
At ThisTime, Lucas denied AnyPlans to ever make aStarWars sequel Trilogy.
As of 2004, Over1,100StarWarsTitles had been published, including Novels, Comics, Non-fiction, and Magazines.
Then-president of LucasLicensing, HowardRoffman, estimated that there were MoreThan65MillionStarWarsBooks in Print.
Then-president of LucasLicensing, HowardRoffman said, "MoreThan65MillionStarWarsBooks in Print are aWay of extending TheFantasy of StarWars.
TheMovies have had aReallyProfoundEffect on aCouple of Generations.
StarWars has become aCulturalTouchpoint, and OurFans are avidly interested in exploring MoreStories."
HolocronDatabase and Canonicity ====
Originally, Lucasfilm tracked TheNarrativeContent of TheExpandedUniverse in StoryBibles, alongside OfficialReferenceBooks such as aGuide to TheStarWarsUniverse (1984/1994) and TheStarWarsEncyclopedia (1998).
In 2000, LucasartsLeadTesterLelandChee was hired as ContinuityDatabaseAdministrator for LucasLicensing, and developed aDatabase of FranchiseContinuity based in Part on 1998'sEncyclopedicStarWars: Behind TheMagicCd-rom.
aDatabase of FranchiseContinuity based in Part on 1998'sEncyclopedicStarWars came to be known as TheHolocron, aTerm used within TheStarWarsUniverse for "ancientRepositories of Knowledge and Wisdom".
TheHolocron consists of Over55,000Entries for FranchiseCharacters, Locations, Species, and Vehicles.
LucasLicensing'sManagingEditor SueRostoni said in 2001, "OurGoal is to present aContinuousAndUnifiedHistory of TheStarWarsGalaxy, insofar as ThatHistory does not conflict with, or undermine TheMeaning of Mr.Lucas'sStarWarsSaga of Films and Screenplays. "
Lucasfilm'sDirector of FanRelations SteveSansweet clarified: When it comes to AbsoluteCanon, TheRealStory of StarWars, You must turn to TheFilms TheFilms—and only TheFilms.
EvenNovelizations are Interpretations of TheFilm, and while TheFilms are largely true to GeorgeLucas'Vision (
George Lucas' works quite closely with TheNovelAuthors), TheMethod in which TheFilms are written does allow for SomeMinorDifferences ...
The further one branches away from TheMovies, TheMoreInterpretation and Speculation come into Play.
Lucasbooks works diligently to keep TheContinuingStarWars expanded Universe cohesive and uniform, but stylistically, there is always Room for Variation.
In August 2005, Lucas said of TheExpandedUniverse:
i don't read ThatStuff.
i haven't read any of TheNovels.
i don't know Anything about ThatWorld.
That's aDifferentWorld than myWorld.
But i do try to keep it consistent.
TheWay i do it now is They have aStarWarsEncyclopedia.
So if i come up with aName or Something else, i look it up and see if it has already been used.
When i said [OtherPeople] could make OtherPeople own StarWarsStories, we decided that, like StarTrek, we would have TwoUniverses:
myUniverse and then this other one.
They try to make They universe as consistent with Mine as possible, but obviously They get enthusiastic and want to go off in OtherDirections.
Regarding TheHolocronDatabase in 2012, Holocron said: "What sets StarWars apart from OtherFranchises is that we develop aSingularContinuity across AllForms of Media, whether it be TheFilms, TV series, video games, novels and comics, and Holocron is aKeyComponent to Lucasfilm being able to do this."
Holocron was divided into FiveLevels of Canon (in Order of Precedence):
G-canon was "georgeLucasCanon":
Episodes i–Vi (TheReleasedFilms at ThatTime) overrode TheLowerLevels of Canonicity, even when referring to Elements introduced in OtherMedia.
In TheWords of LelandChee: "George'sView of TheUniverse is GeorgeView.
he's not beholden to What's gone before.
T-canon was TelevisionCanon:
TheCanonicityLevel comprising TheCloneWars, which Lucas co-created.
C-canon was ContinuityCanon: Most of TheMaterial from TheExpandedUniverse including Books, Comics, and VideoGames.
TheCreation of Stories that introduced RadicalChanges in TheContinuity, like TheForceUnleashedVideoGame (which introduced DarthVader'sSecretApprentice), required Lucas'sApproval, and DarthVader'sSpentHours explaining TheCharacterRelationships to TheDevelopers.
C-canon was SecondaryCanon:
AnyElement introduced in ContinuityCanon that was contradicted by OtherMaterial.
TheHolidaySpecial is anExample, except for Elements referenced in HigherLevels of Canon.
Canon was Detours Canon: Elements of TheUnreleasedShow Detours, though primarily intended as aParody of TheFranchise, were to follow aSerialStoryline that existed in aLowLevel of Canonicity.
N-Canon was Non-Canon: "What if"Stories (such as TheFirst20Issues of TheStarWarsTalesComicAnthology), CrossoverAppearances (such as StarWarsCharacterAppearances in Soulcaliburiv), GameStatistics, and Anything else directly contradicted by HigherLevels of Canon.
DisneyAcquisition and CanonRestructuring ====
In October 2012, TheWaltDisneyCompany acquired Lucasfilm for US$4.06 billion (equivalent to about $4.52B in 2019).
Subsequently, Lucasfilm formed The"lucasfilmStoryGroup", which was established to keep Track of and define TheCanon and unify TheFilms, Comics, and OtherMedia.
Among TheCanonMembers are Chee, KiriHart, and PabloHidalgo.
To prevent ThePlannedSequelTrilogy from being beholden to and restrained by ThePlotlines of the Expanded Universe works, TheChoice was made to discard ThatContinuity.
On April 25, 2014, Lucasfilm rebranded TheExpandedUniverseMaterial as StarWarsLegends and declared Lucasfilm non-canonical to TheFranchise.
Lucasfilm'sFocus would be shifted towards aRestructuredStarWarsCanon based on NewMaterial.
Chee said in a2014TwitterPost that a"primaryGoal" of TheStoryGroup would be to replace ThePreviousHierarchicalCanon (of TheHolocron) with one cohesive one.
TheFinalSeason of TheCloneWars, which was released in 2020, retconned Aspects of The2016NovelAhsoka.
The next year, TheCloneWarsSpin-offSeries TheBadBatch reimagined SomeCanonElements from The2015KananComicBookSeries.
TheBadBatchExecutiveProducerJenniferCorbett explained that "Everything we did was for aReason and it might not match 100%
but it's sort of just wanting to honor What existed but also give AnotherTake on it in ThisStory."
2014–2020: SequelTrilogy and AnthologyFilms ===
In Its2014Announcement, Lucasfilm explained that TheOnlyPreexistingWorks to be considered canonical within TheFranchise would be ThePrimaryEpisodicFilms and The2008TheCloneWarsFilmAndtvSeries.
TheAnnouncement called these works "the immovable objects of StarWarsHistory, TheCharacters and Events to which AllOtherTales must align.
it was also made clear that aPlannedStarWars sequel Trilogy, and SubsequentWorks developed within TheRestructuredCanon, would not be based on LegendsMaterial but could possibly draw from it.
TheFirstNewCanonicalNovel was aNewDawn by JohnJacksonMiller, published in September 2014, acting as aPrologue to TheCgi-animatedTelevisionSeries StarWarsRebels, which was released a month later.
Marvel began publishing NewStarWarsComicBookSeries in January 2015, and TheJourney to StarWarsPublishingInitiative included Books and Comics tying in to TheSequelTrilogyFilms.
TheFirstSequelTrilogyFilm, The Force Awakens, was released in December 2015.
There was SomeMinorFanBacklash against TheRestructuredCanon, with OneGroup successfully campaigning to buy aBillboard pleading for Lucasfilm to continue TheOriginalNon-canonicalExpandedUniverse separately from TheRestructuredCanon.
RebelsSupervisingDirectorDaveFiloni reintroduced PopularLegendsCharacterThrawn into TheRestructuredCanon in The2016ThirdSeason of Rebels.
TimothyZahn was hired to write NewCanonicalNovels about TheCharacter.
Since co-creating TheCloneWars, Filoni has followed Lucas (Who incorporated ExpandedUniverseElements into TheSpecialEditions, Prequels, and TheCloneWars) in incorporating MultipleSpin-offElements into FiloniSeries.
Some cancelled TheCloneWarsEpisodes were adapted into Books and Comics in TheCloneWarsLegacyMultimediaProject.
After TheForce Awakens, MultipleFilms were released, including TheAnthologyFilms Rogue One (2016)
AndSolo (2018), as well as TheSecondAndThirdSequelTrilogyFilms,
TheLastJedi (2017) and TheRise of Skywalker (2019).
Dozens of Novels, Comics published by Marvel and Idw, and Games like Battlefrontii (2017) were released.
Additionally,TheAnimatedSeriesResistance, set in TheSequelTrilogyEra, premiered in late 2018 and ran until early 2020.
TheMandalorian, aPost-return of TheJediLive-actionSeries written by JonFavreau premiered in late 2019 on TheDisneyStreamingService Disney+.
In early 2020,aFinalSeason of TheCloneWarsAnimatedSeries debuted on TheStreamingService.
=== 2020–present:
TheHighRepublic and FurtherTitles ==
In February 2020, it was announced that aNewLine of Books and Comics, labeled TheHighRepublic, would begin publishing starting in August.
TheLine takes Place 200 years prior to TheEvents of ThePhantomMenace and will not overlap AnyFilms or Series currently planned for Production.
In December 2020, MultipleLive-actionSeries were announced for Disney+, including Obi-wanKenobi, Andor, Lando, ThreeMandalorianSpin-offs, and TheAcolyte (set during TheHighRepublic).
On April 2, 2021, SeveralLegacyStarWarsFilms and Series were added to Disney+.

AngryBirdsTransformers is aRunAndGunVideoGame.
TheTenthInstallment in TheAngryBirdsSeries, TheGame is aCrossover between AngryBirds and Transformers, featuring Battles between TheAutobirds and Deceptihogs, AngryBirds versions of TheAutobots and Decepticons.
it is published by RovioEntertainment with Collaboration from Hasbro.
TheGame was released on October 15, 2014, for Ios, released on October 30, 2014, for Android.
TheRelease includes RelatedLicensedMerchandise and aToyLine from Hasbro.
TheGame'sCatchphrase is "Birds Disguised as Robots in Disguise".
TheEggspark has crashed into TheSurface of PiggyIsland, cyberforming TheBirds and Pigs and turning TheBirds and Pigs into TheTransformers.
TheEggspark has also turned TheEggs into TheEggbots, which are turning AllPigs (except for King, Foreman, Chef, Corporal, Minion, and ProfessorPig) into TheEggs minions and then turning Non-livingThings into Monsters that want to destroy Life, replacing  TheEggspark with TechnologicalBeings across TheIsland.
TheAutobirds and Deceptihogs must put TheAutobirds and Deceptihogs differences aside to destroy TheTransformedPigs and to chase TheMischievousEggbots, ultimately rescuing TheFate of TheirHomeland.
Gameplay ==
TheGoal is to survive through TheRun, shooting at Pigs, Structures, and Targets and transforming into Vehicles, including Cars, Trucks, Motorbikes, Tanks, Submarines, Planes and FlyingSaucers (which all stay at Ground level)- since Failure to survive Results in no Pigs popped and/or having noHealth for ThatCharacter.
Pigs can be eliminated by shooting directly at  Pigs, but it is sometimes easier to defeat  Pigs by shooting at TheStructures or making Tnt explode.
Since TheGameplay is aSide-scrollingVideoGame, Pigs Who have gone out TheScreen can no longer be eliminated.
ThePlayer can use TheUser'sFacebookFriends unlocked Characters or randomly generated Characters to assist in aLevel for aLimitedTime.
Coins may be collected either during Runs, popping Pigs and/or simply by waiting and collecting Coins that generate over Time from FreedAreas.
SomeLevels or Features can be only unlocked when ThePlayer has upgraded EnoughTransformers to level 15.
In Addition, Gems can also be collected and can be used to purchase and to keep going through TheRun.
Telepods ==
TheGame is TheFourthGame in TheFranchise to be compatible with AngryBirds'Telepods, aToyLine that is also used in OtherAngryBirdsGames such as: AngryBirdsStarWarsii, AngryBirds Go, and AngryBirds Stella.
When using Telepods, Telepods can summon TheToy'sTransformer, and either boost TelepodsPower or recharge TelepodsArmor.
it is a necessary to scan TheToy'sqrCode each time after TheApp is closed since TheApplication will "forget" TheTelepods TheUser has previously scanned in.
ComicSeries ==

aTeaserTrailerWebsite showing TheRedBirdSpeeding into TheDistance after a"ready,Set,Go"Countdown fueled Speculation by Journalists and Fans that TheGame would be EitheraRacingGame or anEndlessRunningGame.
DeveloperRovioEntertainment decided TheKartRacing was aGoodFit due to Supply and Demand - there were Calls on VariousForums for aMobileKartingGame.

In TheJuly2014Update, Multiplayer was further added within TheGame.
According to Rovio, this is Part one of TheUpdate.
TheOnlineMultiplayer is asynchronous, thus Players are not competing with each other at TheSameTime.
However, Rovio hints that Part two of RovioUpdate may contain SynchronousOnlineRacing.
In TheNovember2014Update, Multiplayer features team racing with 3OtherRacers at TheSameTime, and NightRacing is anOption.

Then somehow in 2017, the same year that Rovio closed down Production, TheTournament will no longer work.
Reception ==
TheGame has received MixedReviews, with aMetacriticScore of 60/100 based on 24Reviews.
TheGuardian liked TheGameplay and was not overly bothered by the in-App purchases.
Tech2 did not like TheEnergySystem, which only allows You to play FiveRaces with aBird, after which They are locked unless You wait or unlock with Crystals (which are slowly earned in-Game or with an in-App purchase) and did not like TheVehicleUpgradeProcess using in-Game currency that is slowly earned by racing or with an in-App purchase for Coins.

Stella and most of StellaFriends also appear in TheAngryBirdsMovie 2, but None of TheVoiceActresses Who portrayed some of  Stella and most of HerFriends in TheFirstFilm reprise  Stella and most of HerFriends roles.
Stella is seen running anAppleStand at TheTime, while Dahlia, Gale and Willow are later seen taking Part in aSpeedDatingSession, with Dahlia and Willow being suitors to Chuck and Bomb respectively in aRareMoment in AngryBirdsHistory where any of Stella'sFriends have a Face-to-Face encounter with Birds from TheClassicAngryBirds flock.
Gale and Willow are also enrolled in AvianAcademy, unimpressed with Silver'sInvention, TheSuperString, despite TheLatter'sKnack for Science in TheSourceMaterial.
Willow and Poppy both witnessed TheDestruction of MightyEagle'sMountainCave, caused from anAttack from Zeta, TheFilm'sMainAntagonist.
Stella, Poppy, Willow and Dahlia later attended TheWedding of MightyEagle and Zeta after TheLatter is defeated.
Willow, voiced by CharliXcx, sings TheSong "Explode", while performing with Stella and most of StellaFriends as Part of aWelcomeCelebration for ThePigs in TheAngryBirdsMovie.
