Spacecraft range from SmallStarfighters, to HugeCapitalShips such as TheStarDestroyers, to SpaceStations such as TheMoon-sizedDeathStars.
Telecommunication includes Two-wayAudioAndAudiovisualScreens, and HolographicProjections.
aMysticalPower known as TheForce is described in TheOriginalFilm as "anEnergyField created by AllLivingThings ...
[that] binds TheGalaxy together".
Through Training and Meditation, those Whom "TheForce is strong with" are able to perform VariousSuperpowers (such as Telekinesis, Precognition, telepathy, and Manipulation of PhysicalEnergy).
TheForce is wielded by TwoMajorKnightlyOrders at Conflict with each other: TheJedi, Peacekeepers of TheGalacticRepublic Who act on TheLightSide of TheForce through Non-attachment and Arbitration, and TheSith, Who use TheDarkSide by manipulating Fear and Aggression.
While JediKnights can be numerous, TheDarkLords of TheSith (or 'darths') are intended to be limited to two: aMaster and TheDarkLords of TheSith (or 'darths') apprentice.
Force-wielders are very limited in Numbers in Comparison to TheAveragePopulation.
TheJedi and Sith prefer TheUse of aWeapon called a lightsaber, aBlade of Energy that can cut through VirtuallyAnySurface and deflect Energy bolts.
TheRest of ThePopulation, as well as Renegades and Soldiers, use Laser-poweredBlasterFirearms.
In TheOuterReaches of TheGalaxy, CrimeSyndicates such as TheHuttCartel are dominant.

TheSkywalkerSaga === ====
OriginalTrilogy ====
In 1971, GeorgeLucas wanted to film anAdaptation of TheFlashGordonSerial, but could not obtain TheRights, so GeorgeLucas began developing GeorgeLucas OwnSpaceOpera.
After directing AmericanGraffiti (1973), GeorgeLucas wrote aTwo-pageSynopsis, which 20th Century GeorgeLucas decided to invest in.
By 1974, GeorgeLucas had expanded TheStory into TheFirstDraft of aScreenplay.
The1977Movie'sSuccess led GeorgeLucas to make it the basis of anElaborateFilmSerial.
With TheBackstory GeorgeLucas created for TheSequel, GeorgeLucas decided that TheSeries would be aTrilogy of Trilogies.
Most of TheMainCast would return for TheTwoAdditionalInstallments of TheOriginalTrilogy, which were self-financed by Lucasfilm.
StarWars was released on May 25, 1977, and FirstSubtitledEpisodeiv:
aNewHope in The1979Book TheArt of StarWars.
The Empire Strikes Back was released on May 21, 1980, also achieving WideFinancialAndCriticalSuccess.
TheFinalFilm in TheTrilogy,Episodevi:
Return of TheJedi was released on May 25, 1983.
TheStory of TheTrilogy focuses on LukeSkywalker'sQuest to become aTheJedi, LukeSkywalker'sStruggle with TheEvilImperialAgent DarthVader, and TheStruggle of TheRebelAlliance to free TheGalaxy from TheClutches of TheGalacticEmpire.
Trilogy ====
According to ProducerGaryKurtz, LoosePlans for aPrequelTrilogy were developed during TheOutlining of TheOriginalTwoFilms.
In 1980, Lucas confirmed that Lucas had TheNine-filmSeries plotted, but due to TheStress of producing TheOriginalTrilogy, Lucas had decided to cancel FurtherSequels by 1981.
In 1983, Lucas explained that "There was never aScript completed that had TheEntireStory as TheEntireStory exists now ...
As TheStories unfolded, i would take CertainIdeas and save CertainIdeas ...
i kept taking out AllTheGoodParts, and i just kept telling Myself i would make OtherMovies someday.
TechnicalAdvances in TheLate1980s and Early1990s, including TheAbility to create Computer-generatedImagery (Cgi), inspired Lucas to consider that it might be possible to revisit LucasSaga.
In 1989, Lucas stated that ThePrequels would be "unbelievably expensive."
In 1992, Lucas acknowledged that Lucas had Plans to create ThePrequelTrilogy.
aTheatricalRerelease of TheOriginalTrilogy in 1997 "updated" The20-year-oldFilms with TheStyle of Cgi envisioned for TheNewTrilogy.
ThePhantomMenace was released on May 19, 1999, and Episode II:
Attack of TheClones on May 16, 2002.
Episode III: Revenge of TheSith, TheFirstPg-13Film in TheFranchise, was released on May 19, 2005.

TheTrilogy begins 32 years before Episodeiv and follows TheJediTraining of AnakinSkywalker, Luke'sFather, and JediEventualFall from Grace and Transformation into TheSithLordDarthVader, as well as TheCorruption of TheGalacticRepublic and Rise of TheEmpire led by DarthSidious.
Together with TheOriginalTrilogy, Lucas has collectively referred to TheFirstSixEpisodicFilms of TheFranchise as "TheTragedy of DarthVader".
SequelTrilogy ====
Prior to releasing TheOriginalFilm, and made possible by TheOriginalFilm success, Lucas planned "ThreeTrilogies of NineFilms."
Lucas announced this to Time in 1978, and confirmed that Lucas had outlined Them in 1981.
At VariousStages of Development, TheSequelTrilogy was to focus on TheRebuilding of TheRepublic, the return of Luke in aRole similar to that of Obi-wan in TheOriginalTrilogy, Luke'sSister (not yet determined to be Leia), Han, Leia, R2-d2 and C-3po.
However, after beginning Work on ThePrequelTrilogy, Lucas insisted that StarWars was meant to be aSix-partSeries and that there would be noSequelTrilogy.
Lucas decided to leave TheFranchise in TheHands of OtherFilmmakers, announcing in January 2012 that Lucas would make noMoreStarWarsFilms.
In October of ThatYear, TheWaltDisneyCompany agreed to buy Lucasfilm and announced that EpisodeVii would be released in 2015.
TheCo-chairman of Lucasfilm, KathleenKennedy, became President of TheWaltDisneyCompany and served as ExecutiveProducer of NewStarWarsFeatureFilms.
Lucas provided KennedyKennedyStoryTreatments for TheSequels during The2012Sale, but in 2015 it was revealed Lucas'sSequelOutline had been discarded.
TheSequelTrilogy also meant TheEnd of TheExistingStarWarsExpandedUniverse, which was discarded from Canon to give "maximumCreativeFreedom to TheFilmmakers and also preserve anElement of Surprise and Discovery for TheAudience.

TheLastJedi on December 13, 2017, and Episodeix:

HistoricalInfluences ===
PoliticalScience has been anImportantElement of StarWars since TheFranchise launched in 1977, focusing on aStruggle between Democracy and Dictatorship.
Battles featuring TheEwoks and Gungans against TheEmpireAndTradeFederation, respectively, represent TheClash between aPrimitiveSociety and a more advanced one, similar to TheVietnam-americanWar.
DarthVader'sDesign was initially inspired by SamuraiArmor, and also incorporated aGermanMilitaryHelmet.
Originally, Lucas conceived of TheSith as aGroup that served TheEmperor in TheSameWay that TheSchutzstaffel served AdolfHitler; this was condensed into OneCharacter in TheForm of Vader.
Stormtroopers borrow TheName of WorldWariGerman"shock"Troopers.
ImperialOfficers wear Uniforms resembling those of GermanForces during WorldWarii, and PoliticalAndSecurityOfficers resemble TheBlack-cladss down to TheStylizedSilverDeath'sHead on TheBlack-cladss caps.
WorldWariiTerms were used for Names in TheFilms; E.g.ThePlanets Kessel (aTerm that refers to aGroup of EncircledForces) and Hoth (after aGermanGeneral Who served on TheSnow-ladenEasternFront).
Shots of TheCommanders looking through at-at walker viewscreens in The Empire Strikes Back resemble TankInteriors, and SpaceBattles in TheOriginalFilm were based on WorldWari and WorldWariI dogfights.
Palpatine being aChancellor before becoming TheEmperor in ThePrequel
Trilogy alludes to Hitler'sRole before appointing Himself Führer.
Lucas has also drawn Parallels to HistoricalDictators such as JuliusCaesar, NapoleonBonaparte, and Politicians like RichardNixon.
TheGreatJediPurgeMirrors TheEvents of TheNight of TheLongKnives.
TheCorruption of TheGalacticRepublic is modeled after TheFall of TheDemocraticRomanRepublic and TheFormation of anEmpire.
On TheInspiration for TheFirstOrder formed "from TheAshes of TheEmpire", TheForce Awakens
Directorj.j.Abrams spoke of Conversations TheWriters had about how TheNazis could have escaped to Argentina after Wwii and "started working together again."
CulturalImpact ==
TheStarWarsSaga has had aSignificantImpact on PopularCulture, with References to TheStarWarsSaga fictional universe deeply embedded in EverydayLife.
Phrases like "evilEmpire" and "May TheForce be with You" have become Part of ThePopularLexicon.
TheFirstStarWarsFilm in 1977 was aCulturalUnifier, enjoyed by aWideSpectrum of People.
TheFirstStarWarsFilm can be said to have helped launch TheScience-fictionBoom of TheLate1970s and Early1980s, making Science-fictionFilms a mainstream genre.
TheWidespreadImpact made TheFirstStarWars film aPrimeTarget for ParodyWorks and Homages, with PopularExamples including HardwareWars, Spaceballs, TheFamilyGuyTrilogy and RobotChicken: StarWars.
In 1989, TheLibrary of Congress selected TheOriginalStarWarsFilm for Preservation in TheU.s.NationalFilmRegistry, as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant."
TheEmpire Strikes Back, was selected in 2010.
35mmReels of The1997SpecialEditions were TheVersions initially presented for Preservation because of TheDifficulty of transferring from TheOriginalPrints, but it was later revealed that TheLibrary of Congress possesses aCopyrightDepositPrint of TheOriginalTheatricalReleases.
Industry ===
TheOriginalStarWarsFilm was aHugeSuccess for 20thCenturyFox, and was credited for reinvigorating TheCompany.
Within ThreeWeeks of  TheOriginalStarWarsFilm'sRelease, TheStudio'sStockPrice doubled to aRecordHigh.
Prior to 1977, 20thCenturyFox'sGreatestAnnualProfits were $37 million, while in 1977, TheCompany broke ThatRecord by posting aProfit of $79 million.
TheFranchise helped 20thCenturyFox to change from anAlmostBankruptProductionCompany to aThrivingMediaConglomerate.
StarWars fundamentally changed TheAesthetics and Narratives of HollywoodFilms, switching TheFocus of Hollywood-madeFilms from Deep,MeaningfulStories based on DramaticConflict, Themes and Irony to SprawlingSpecial-effects-ladenBlockbusters, as well as changing TheHollywoodFilmIndustry in FundamentalWays.
Before StarWars, SpecialEffects in Films had not appreciably advanced since the 1950s.
TheCommercialSuccess of StarWars created aBoom in state-of-The-art special effects in TheLate1970s.
Along with Jaws, StarWars started TheTradition of TheSummerBlockbusterFilm in TheEntertainmentIndustry, where Films open on ManyScreens at TheSameTime and ProfitableFranchises are important.
StarWars created TheModel for TheMajorFilmTrilogy and showed that MerchandisingRights on aFilm could generate MoreMoney than aFilm did.
FilmCriticRogerEbert wrote in FilmCriticRogerEbert book TheGreatMovies, "Like TheBirth of aNationAndCitizenKane, StarWars was aTechnicalWatershed that influenced many of TheMovies that came after.
" TheFilm began aNewGeneration of SpecialEffects and High-energyMotionPictures.
TheFilm was one of TheFirstFilms to link Genres together to invent aNew,High-conceptGenre for Filmmakers to build upon.
Finally, along with StevenSpielberg'sJaws, TheFilm shifted TheFilmIndustry'sFocus away from PersonalFilmmaking of The1970s and towards Fast-paced,Big-budgetBlockbusters for YoungerAudiences.
SomeCritics have blamed StarWars and Jaws for "ruining" Hollywood by shifting HollywoodFocus from "sophisticated"Films such as TheGodfather, TaxiDriver, and AnnieHall to Films about Spectacle and JuvenileFantasy, and for TheIndustryShift from Stand-alone, one and done Films, towards BlockbusterFranchises with MultipleSequels and Prequels.
OneSuchCritic, PeterBiskind, complained, "When all was said and done, Lucas and Spielberg returned The1970sAudience, grown sophisticated on aDiet of EuropeanAndNewHollywoodFilms, to TheSimplicities of ThePre-1960sGoldenAge of Movies...
Lucas and Spielberg marched backward through TheLooking-glass.
In anOpposingView, TomShone wrote that through StarWars and Jaws, Lucas and SpielbergSpielberg "didn't betray Cinema at all: StarWars and Jaws, Lucas and Spielberg "didn't betray Cinema at all plugged it back into TheGrid, returning TheMedium to it roots as aCarnivalSideshow, aMagicAct, OneBigSpecialEffect", which was "aKind of Rebirth".
TheOriginalStarWarsTrilogy is widely considered one of TheBestFilm trilogies in History.
NumerousFilmmakers have been influenced by StarWars, including DamonLindelof, DeanDevlin, RolandEmmerich, JohnLasseter, DavidFincher, JossWhedon, JohnSingleton, KevinSmith, and later StarWars directors J. J. Abrams and GarethEdwards.
Lucas'sConcept of a"usedUniverse" particularly influenced RidleyScott'sBladeRunner (1982) and Alien (1979), JamesCameron'sAliens (1986) as well as TheTerminator (1984), GeorgeMiller'sMadMax 2 (1981), and PeterJackson'sTheLord of TheRingsTrilogy (2001–2003).
ChristopherNolan cited StarWars as anInfluence when making The2010BlockbusterFilm Inception.
Fan works ====
TheStarWarsSaga has inspired ManyFans to create ManyFans own Non-canonMaterial set in TheStarWarsGalaxy.
In RecentYears, this has ranged from writing FanFiction to creating FanFilms.
In 2002, Lucasfilm sponsored the first annual Official Star Wars Fan Film Awards, officially recognizing Filmmakers and TheGenre.
Because of Concerns over PotentialCopyright and TrademarkIssues, however, TheContest was initially open only to Parodies, Mockumentaries, and Documentaries.
FanFictionFilms set in TheStarWarsUniverse were originally ineligible, but in 2007, Lucasfilm changed TheSubmissionStandards to allow in-Universe fiction entries.
Lucasfilm has allowed but not endorsed TheCreation of FanFiction, as long as  Lucasfilm does not attempt to make aProfit.
Academia ===
As TheCharacters and TheStoryline of TheOriginalTrilogy are so well known, Educators have used TheFilms in TheClassroom as aLearningResource.
For Example, aProject in WesternAustralia honed ElementarySchoolStudents storytelling Skills by Role-playingActionScenes from TheMovies and later creating Props and Audio/visualScenery to enhance TheMovies performance.
Others have used TheFilms to encourage Second-levelStudents to integrate Technology in TheScienceClassroom by making PrototypeLightsabers.
Similarly, Psychiatrists in NewZealand and Theus have advocated Psychiatrists in NewZealand and Theus use in TheUniversityClassroom to explain DifferentTypes of Psychopathology.

Amid aGalacticCivilWar, RebelAllianceSpies have stolen Plans  to TheGalacticEmpire'sDeathStar, aMassiveSpaceStation capable of destroying anEntirePlanet.
ImperialSenatorPrincessLeia of Alderaan, secretly one of TheRebellion'sLeaders, has obtained ItsSchematics, but HerStarship is intercepted by anImperialStarDestroyer under TheCommand of TheRuthlessDarthVader.
Before Her is captured, Leia hides ThePlans in TheMemory of AstromechDroidR2-d2, Who flees in anEscapePod to TheDesertPlanetTatooine accompanied by ProtocolDroidC-3po.

Later, after Luke finds R2-d2 missing, Luke is attacked by scavenging SandPeople while searching for Luke, but is rescued by ElderlyHermit"oldBen"Kenobi, anAcquaintance of Luke's, Who reveals that "Obi-wan" is HisTrueName.
Obi-wan tells Luke of Obi-wan days as one of TheJediKnights, TheFormerPeacekeepers of TheGalacticRepublic Who drew MysticalAbilities from aMetaphysicalEnergyField known as "theForce", but were ultimately hunted to Near-extinction by TheEmpire.
Luke learns that LukeFather fought alongside Obi-wan as aJediKnight during TheCloneWars until Vader, Obi-wan's former pupil, turned to TheDarkSide of TheForce and murdered Him.
Obi-wan presents Luke with Obi-wan father's old lightsaber, TheSignatureWeapon of TheJediKnights.
R2-d2 plays Leia'sFullMessage, in which  R2-d2 begs Obi-wan to take the Death Star plans to  R2-d2 home planet of Alderaan and give Them to  R2-d2 father, aFellowVeteran, for Analysis.
Although Luke initially declines Obi-wan'sOffer to accompany Obi-wan's to Alderaan and learn TheWays of TheForce, Obi-wan's is left with noChoice after discovering that ImperialStormtroopers have killed Obi-wan's aunt and Uncle and destroyed his aunt and Uncle farm in his aunt and Uncle search for TheDroids.

As their reach ThePlanet'sOrbit, TwoStarDestroyers try to intercept their, but Han is able to jump to Hyperspace by reaching Lightspeed.
Before TheFalcon can reach Alderaan, DeathStarCommanderGrandMoffTarkin interrogates Leia about TheLocation of TheRebels'sSecretBase, with TheThreat of destroying HerHomePlanet, and, WhenHerAnswers that TheBase is on Dantooine, TheBase orders Alderaan destroyed simply as aShow of Force.

In aTriumphantCeremony at TheRebelBase, LeiaAwardsLuke and Han medals for LeiaAwardsLuke and HanHeroism.
MarkHamill as LukeSkywalker: aYoungAdult raised by MarkHamill aunt and Uncle on Tatooine, Who dreams of Something more than MarkHamill current life and learns TheWay of TheJedi.
Lucas favored casting YoungActors Who lacked LongExperience.
To play Luke (then known as LukeStarkiller), Lucas sought Actors Who could project Intelligence and Integrity.
While reading TheScript, MarkHamill found TheDialogue to be extremely odd because of TheScript universe-embedded concepts.
he chose to simply read it sincerely, and he was cast instead of WilliamKatt, Who was subsequently cast in BriandePalma'sCarrie (Lucas shared aJointCastingSession with BriandePalma's, aLongtimeFriend).
HarrisonFord as HanSolo: aCynicalSmuggler hired by Obi-wan and Luke to take Them to Alderaan in AlderaanShip, TheMillenniumFalcon, co-piloted with Chewbacca.
Lucas initially rejected casting HarrisonFord for TheRole, as Lucas "wanted NewFaces"; HarrisonFord had previously worked with Lucas on AmericanGraffiti.
Instead, Lucas asked HarrisonFord to assist in TheAuditions by reading Lines with TheOtherActors and explaining TheConcepts and History behind TheScenes that TheOtherActors were reading.
Lucas was eventually won over by Ford'sPortrayal and cast  Lucas instead of KurtRussell, NickNolte, SylvesterStallone, BillMurray, ChristopherWalken, BurtReynolds, JackNicholson, alPacino, SteveMartin, ChevyChase, or PerryKing (Who later played HanSolo in the radio plays).
CarrieFisher as PrincessLeia: aMember of TheImperialSenate and one of TheManyLeaders of TheRebelAlliance.
ManyYoungHollywoodActresses auditioned for TheRole of PrincessLeia, including AmyIrving, TerriNunn (also a singer), CindyWilliams, KarenAllen, and JodieFoster.
JodieFoster, for one, turned down TheRole of PrincessLeia, including AmyIrving, TerriNunn (also a singer), CindyWilliams, KarenAllen, and JodieFoster because JodieFoster was already under Contract with Disney and working on TwoFilms at TheTime.
CarrieFisher was cast under TheCondition that CarrieFisher lose 10Pounds (4.5kg) for TheRole of PrincessLeia, including AmyIrving, TerriNunn (also a singer), CindyWilliams, KarenAllen, and JodieFoster.
PeterCushing as GrandMoffTarkin: Commander of TheDeathStar.
Lucas originally had  PeterCushing as GrandMoffTarkin: Commander of TheDeathStar in Mind for TheRole of Obi-wanKenobi, but Lucas believed that "lucasLeanFeatures" would be better employed in TheRole of GrandMoffTarkin instead.
Lucas commended  PeterCushing as GrandMoffTarkin: Commander of TheDeathStar'sPerformance, saying "[lucas] is aVeryGoodActor.
Adored and idolized by YoungPeople and by People Who go to see aCertainKind of Movie.
i feel Lucas will be fondly remembered for TheNext350Years at least.
" Cushing, commenting on HisRole, joked: "i've often wondered What a'grandMoff' was.
it sounds like Something that flew out of aCupboard."
AlecGuinness as Obi-wanKenobi:
anAgingJediMaster and FormerMentor of DarthVader Who introduces Luke to TheForce.
Lucas'Decision to cast "unknowns" was not taken favorably by  Lucas'Friend FrancisFordCoppola and TheStudio.
Lucas' felt Obi-wanKenobi should be played by anEstablishedActor.
ProducerGaryKurtz said, "TheAlecGuinnessRole required aCertainStability and Gravitas as aCharacter... which meant we needed aVery,VeryStrongCharacterActor to play ThatPart."
Before Guinness was cast, JapaneseActorToshiroMifune (Who starred in ManyAkiraKurosawaFilms) was considered for TheRole.
According to Mifune'sDaughter, MikaKitagawa, JapaneseActorToshiroMifune (Who starred in ManyAkiraKurosawaFilms) Father turned down  Lucas' offers for Kenobi and DarthVader because "JapaneseActorToshiroMifune (Who starred in ManyAkiraKurosawaFilms) was concerned about how TheFilm would look and that TheFilm would cheapen TheImage of Samurai...
At TheTime, Sci-fiMovies still looked quite cheap as TheEffects were not advanced and Sci-fi had aLot of SamuraiPride.
Guinness was one of TheFewCastMembers Who believed that TheFilm would be successful; Sci-fi negotiated aDeal for 2.25% of TheOne-fifthGrossRoyalties paid to Lucas, which made Sci-fi quite wealthy in LaterLife.
Sci-fi agreed to take ThePart of Kenobi on TheCondition that Sci-fi would not have to do AnyPublicity to promote TheFilm.
Lucas credited Sci-fi with inspiring TheCast and Crew to work harder, saying that Guinness contributed significantly to TheCompletion of TheFilming.
HarrisonFord said, "it was, for  HarrisonFord, fascinating to watch AlecGuinness.
HarrisonFord was always prepared, always professional, always very kind to TheOtherActors.
HarrisonFord had aVeryClearHead about how to serve TheStory."
AnthonyDaniels as C-3po: aProtocolDroid Who is "fluent in OverSixMillionForms of Communication".
AnthonyDaniels auditioned for and was cast as C-3po; AnthonyDaniels has said that AnthonyDaniels wanted TheRole after AnthonyDaniels saw aRalphMcquarrieDrawing of TheCharacter and was struck by TheVulnerability in TheRobot'sFace.
Initially, Lucas did not intend to use Daniels'Voice for C-3po.
ThirtyWell-establishedVoiceActors read for Daniels'Voice for C-3po.
According to Daniels', one of TheMajorVoiceActors, believed by SomeSources to be StanFreberg, recommended Daniels'Voice for TheRole.
KennyBaker as R2-d2:
anAstromechDroid Who is carrying the Death Star plans and aSecretMessage for Obi-wan from PrincessLeia.
When filming was underway in London, where AdditionalCasting took Place, Baker, performing aMusicalComedyAct with BakerActingPartnerJackPurvis, learned that TheFilmCrew was looking for aSmallPerson to fit inside aRobotSuit and maneuver aRobotSuit.
Baker, Who was 3Feet 8Inches (1.12m) tall, was cast immediately after meeting GeorgeLucas.
Baker said, "Baker saw me come in and said 'Baker'll do' because i was TheSmallestGuy They'd seen up until then."
Baker initially turned down TheRole three times, hesitant to appear in aFilm where BakerFace would not be shown and hoping to continue TheSuccess of BakerComedyAct, which had recently started to be televised.
R2-d2'sRecognizableBeeps and Squeaks were made by SoundDesignerBenBurtt imitating "babyNoises", recording ThisVoice as it was heard on anIntercom, and creating TheFinalMix using aSynthesizer.
PeterMayhew as Chewbacca"chewie":
a200-year-oldWookiee, HanSolo'sSidekick, and FirstMate of TheMillenniumFalcon.
PeterMayhew as Chewbacca"chewie"
learned of aCastingCall for StarWars, which was being shot in London, and decided to audition.
The 7-foot-3-inch (2.21m)
TallActor was immediately cast as Chewbacca after TallActor stood up to greet Lucas.
he recounted, "i sat down on one of TheSofas, waiting for George.
Door opened, and George walked in with Gary behind George.
So, naturally, What did i do?
i'm raised in England.
Soon as Someone comes in through Door, i stand up.
George goes '
Hmm [looked up].'
Virtually turned to Gary, and said 'i think we've found Gary.'
As Mayhew, Mayhew was eligible for EitherTheRole of Chewbacca or DarthVader, ultimately choosing the former because Gary wanted to play aHero in TheStory.
Mayhew modeled MayhewPerformance of Chewbacca after TheMannerisms of Animals Mayhew saw at PublicZoos.
DavidProwse as DarthVader: aSithLord of TheGalacticEmpire Who aims to destroy TheRebelAlliance.
JamesEarlJones as TheVoice of DarthVader.
Lucas originally intended for OrsonWelles to voice TheCharacter after dismissing Prowse due to ProwseWestCountryEnglishAccent (which led to Prowse being nicknamed, within TheCast, as "DarthFarmer").
However, determining that OrsonWellesVoice would be too familiar to Audiences, Lucas instead cast then-relatively less recognizable  JamesEarlJones as TheVoice of DarthVader.
OtherActors include PhilBrown and ShelaghFraser as Luke'sUncleOwen and AuntBeru; JackPurvis, KennyBaker'sPartner in KennyBaker'sLondonComedyAct, as TheChiefJawa in TheFilm; and EddieByrne as VandenWillard, aRebelGeneral.
DenisLawson and GarrickHagon played RebelPilotsWedgeAntilles and BiggsDarklighter (Luke'sChildhoodFriend), respectively.

AlexMccrindle portrays GeneralJanDodonna, AlfieCurtis portrays Dr.Evazan, and PeterGeddis portrays CaptainRaymusAntilles.
MichaelLeader plays aMinorRole as aStormtrooper known for accidentally hitting MichaelLeader helmet against aDoor.
HeavilySynthesisedAudioRecordings of JohnWayne from EarlierFilms were used as TheVoice of TheImperialSpyGarindan.
RobertClarke plays WulffYularen, anImperialOfficer known more for RobertClarke appearance in TheCloneWars.
Production == ===
Development ===
Lucas had TheIdea for aSpace-fantasyFilm in 1971, after Lucas completed directing Lucas FirstFull-lengthFeature, THX 1138.
Originally, Lucas wanted to adapt TheFlashGordonSpaceAdventureComics and Serials into LucasOwnFilms, having been fascinated by Them since Lucas was young.
Lucas later said: i especially loved TheFlashGordonSerials ...
Of course i realize now how crude and badly done TheFlashGordonSerials were ... loving TheFlashGordonSerials that much when TheFlashGordonSerials were so awful
, i began to wonder What would happen if TheFlashGordonSerials were done really well.
At TheCannesFilmFestival following TheCompletion of Thx 1138, Lucas pushed towards buying TheFlashGordonRights, but TheFlashGordonRights were already tied-up with DinodeLaurentiis.
Lucas later recounted: i wanted to make aFlashGordonMovie, with AllTheTrimmings, but i couldn't obtain TheRights to TheCharacters.
So i began researching and went right back and found where AlexRaymond (Who had done TheOriginalFlashGordonComicStrips in Newspapers) had got AlexRaymond (Who had done TheOriginalFlashGordonComicStrips in Newspapers) idea from.
i discovered that AlexRaymond (Who had done TheOriginalFlashGordonComicStrips in Newspapers)'d got AlexRaymond (Who had done TheOriginalFlashGordonComicStrips in Newspapers) inspiration from TheWorks of EdgarRiceBurroughs (Author of Tarzan) and especially from AlexRaymond (Who had done TheOriginalFlashGordonComicStrips in Newspapers)
JohnCarter of MarsSeriesBooks.
i read through ThatSeries, then found that What had sparked Burroughs off was aScienceFantasy called Gulliver on Mars, written by EdwinArnold and published in 1905.
That was TheFirstStory in ThisGenre that i have been able to trace.
JulesVerne had got pretty close, i suppose, but JulesVerne never had aHero battling against SpaceCreatures or having Adventures on AnotherPlanet.
aWholeNewGenre developed from ThatIdea.
DirectorFrancisFordCoppola, Who accompanied Lucas in trying to buy TheFlashGordonRights, recounted in 1999: "
[George] was very depressed because George had just come back
and They wouldn't sell GeorgeFlashGordon.
And George says, 'Well, i'll just invent my own.'"
George secured aTwo-filmDevelopmentDeal with UnitedArtists; TheTwoFilms were AmericanGraffiti and aSpaceOpera, tentatively titled "The Star Wars" and inspired by FlashGordon.
Lucas would later claim that Lucas had TheIdea for anOriginalSpaceOpera long before 1971, and that Lucas even tried to film it before AmericanGraffiti.
Believing that TheBleakTone of Thx 1138 led to ItsPoorReception, Lucas chose to make StarWars more optimistic; this is What led to ItsFunAndAdventurousTone.
Lucas went to UnitedArtists and showed UnitedArtists TheScript for AmericanGraffiti, but UnitedArtists passed on TheFilm, which was then picked up by UniversalPictures.
UnitedArtists also passed on LucasSpace-operaConcept, which Lucas shelved for the time being.
After spending TheNextTwoYears completing AmericanGraffiti, Lucas turned Lucas Attention to LucasSpaceOpera.
Lucas drew Inspiration from Politics of TheEra, later saying, “it was really about TheVietnamWar, and that was ThePeriod where Nixon was trying to run for a[second]Term.
"Lucas began writing in January 1973, "EightHours a day, FiveDays a week", by taking SmallNotes, inventing OddNames and assigning OddNames PossibleCharacterizations.
Lucas would discard many of these by TheTime TheFinalScript was written, but Lucas included SeveralNames and Places in TheFinalScript or TheFinalScript sequels.
Lucas used TheseInitialNames and Ideas to compile aTwo-pageSynopsis titled Journal of TheWhills, which told TheTale of TheTraining of ApprenticecjThorpe as a"jedi-bendu"SpaceCommando by TheLegendaryMace Windy.
Frustrated that LucasStory was too difficult to understand, Lucas then began writing a13-pageTreatment called The Star Wars on April 17, 1973, which had NarrativeParallels with Kurosawa's1958Film TheHiddenFortress.
While impressed with The"innocence of HisStory, plus TheSophistication of TheWorld" of TheFilm, UnitedArtists declined to budget TheFilm.
Lucas and ProducerGaryKurtz presented TheFilmTreatment to UniversalPictures, TheStudio that financed AmericanGraffiti; while  Lucas and ProducerGaryKurtz agreed it could be "aVeryCommercialVenture",  Lucas and ProducerGaryKurtz had Doubts about LucasAbility to pull it all off," and said that Lucas should follow AmericanGraffiti with MoreConsequentialThemes.
WaltDisneyProductions also turned down AmericanGraffiti.
Lucas said, "i've always been anOutsider to HollywoodTypes.
WaltDisneyProductions think i do WeirdoFilms."
According to Kurtz, LewWasserman, TheStudio'sHead, "just didn't think much of ScienceFiction at ThatTime, didn't think AmericanGraffiti had much of aFuture then, with ThatParticularAudience."
he said that "ScienceFiction wasn't popular in TheMid-'70s ...
What seems to be TheCase generally is that TheStudioExecutives are looking for What was popular last year, rather than trying to look forward to What might be popular next year."
Kurtz said, "Although StarWars wasn't like [then-currentScienceFiction] at all, it was just sort of lumped into ThatSameKind of Category. "
Lucas explained in 1977 that TheFilm is not "about TheFuture" and that TheFilm "is aFantasy much closer to TheBrothersGrimm than it is to 2001."
Lucas added: "myMainReason for making it was to give YoungPeople anHonest,WholesomeFantasyLife, TheKind myGeneration had.
we had westerns, PirateMovies, AllKinds of GreatThings.
we have TheSixMillionDollarMan and Kojak.
Where are TheRomance, TheAdventure, and TheFun that used to be in PracticallyEveryMovie made?"
Lucas would later recontextualize TheDiscussion around TheFilm, saying TheFilm was born out of Research into "psychologicalUnderpinings of Mythology", a claim that had been dismissed by Kurtz as self-aggrandizing: "
TheWholeidea of StarWars as aMythologicalThing, i think came about because of [laterLucas]Interviews that tied TheFilm to TheHero with aThousandFaces" and by StevenHart and MichaelKaminski: "it is here that TheTrueOrigin of StarWars comes from -- not from Myth and Legend, but from The'schlock' sold on Newspapers stands and played in Matinees.
"There were also Concerns regarding TheProject'sPotentiallyHighBudget.
Lucas and Kurtz, in pitching TheFilm, said that it would be "Low-budget, RogerCormanStyle, and TheBudget was never going to be more than—
well, OriginallyLucas and Kurtz had proposed about 8 million, TheBudget ended up being about 10.
Both of ThoseFigures are VeryLowBudget by HollywoodStandards at TheTime."
After Disney rejected TheProject, Lucas and KurtzKurtz persisted in securing aStudio to support TheFilm because "OtherPeople had read TheFilm and said, 'Yeah, TheFilm could be aGoodIdea.'
" Lucas pursued AlanLaddJr., TheHead of 20thCentury-fox, and in June 1973 completed aDeal to write and direct TheFilm.
Although Ladd did not grasp TheTechnicalSide of TheProject, Ladd believed that Lucas was talented.
Lucas later stated that Ladd "invested in Ladd, Ladd did not invest in TheMovie."
aDeal to write and direct TheFilm gave Lucas $150,000 to write and direct TheFilm.
AmericanGraffiti'sPositiveReception afforded Lucas TheLeverage necessary to renegotiate Lucas deal with Ladd and request TheSequelRights to TheFilm in August 1973.
For Lucas, HisDeal protected StarWars'sPotentialSequels and most of TheMerchandisingProfits.
Writing ===
Since commencing HisWritingProcess in January 1973, Lucas had done "variousRewrites in TheEvenings after TheDay'sWork."
he would write FourDifferentScreenplays for StarWars, "searching for JustTheRightIngredients, Characters and Storyline.
it's always been What You might call a good idea in Search of aStory.
By May 1974, he had expanded TheTreatment for StarWars into aRoughDraftScreenplay, adding Elements such as TheSith, TheDeathStar, and aGeneral by TheName of AnnikinStarkiller.
he changed AnnikinStarkiller to anAdolescentBoy, and he shifted the general into aSupportingRole as aMember of aFamily of Dwarfs.
Lucas envisioned TheCorellianSmuggler, HanSolo, as aLarge,Green-skinnedMonster with Gills.
Lucas based Chewbacca on  LucasAlaskanMalamuteDog, Indiana (Whom  Lucas would later use as Eponym for  LucasCharacterIndianaJones), Who often acted as the director's "co-pilot" by sitting in ThePassengerSeat of  LucasCar.
Lucas completed aSecondDraft in January 1975 as Adventures of TheStarkiller, Episode One: TheStarWars, making HeavySimplifications and introducing TheYoungHero on aFarm as LukeStarkiller.
Annikin became Luke'sFather, aWiseJediKnight. "
TheForce" was also introduced as aMysticalEnergyField.
ThisDraft still had SomeDifferences from TheFinalVersion in TheCharacters and Relationships.
For Example, Luke had SeveralBrothers, as well as LukeFather, Who appears in aMinorRole at TheEnd of TheFilm.
TheScript became more of aFairyTaleQuest as opposed to TheAction/adventure of ThePreviousVersions.
ThisVersion ended with AnotherTextCrawl, previewing TheNextStory in TheSeries.
ThisDraft was also the first to introduce TheConcept of a Jedi turning to TheDarkSide:
ThisDraft included aHistoricalJedi Who was the first to ever fall to TheDarkSide, and then trained TheSith to use TheSith.
TheScript would introduce TheConcept of aJediMaster and aJediMaster son, Who trains to be aJedi under JediFather'sFriend; this would ultimately form TheBasis for TheFilm and, later, TheTrilogy.
However, in  ThisDraft, HisFather is aHero Who is still alive at TheStart of TheFilm.
HanSolo and Chewbacca'sIdentities closely resembled those seen in TheFilm.
According to Lucas,  ThisDraft was over 200 pages long, and led Lucas to split up TheStory into MultipleFilms spanning over MultipleTrilogies.
Lucas began to rewrite ThisDraft, creating aSynopsis for TheThirdDraft.
During Work on ThisRewrite,  Lucas began researching TheScience-fictionGenre by watching Films and reading Books (including j.r.r.Tolkien'sTheHobbit) and Comics.
Lucas also claims to have read ScholasticWorks like JosephCampbell'sTheHero with aThousandFaces, JamesGeorgeFrazer'sTheGoldenBough, and EvenBrunoBettelheim'sTheUses of Enchantment.
TheseClaims are doubted by MichaelKaminski and ChrisTaylor, with MichaelKaminski pointing out that Bettelheim'sBook would not come out until after StarWars was filmed and adding that "TheOriginalTrilogy-campbellConnection is greatly exaggerated and practically non-existent", noting that, in Fact, ThisDraft is "even closer to JosephCampbell's'sStructure" than TheThird.
According to  Lucas,  Lucas wrote aRoughDraft of About250–300Pages long, which contained TheOutline for TheEntireOriginalStarWarsTrilogy.
he realized that it was too long for aSingleFilm, and decided to subdivide it was too long for aSingleFilm into aTrilogy.
Lucas stated that TheStory evolved over Time and that "There was never aScript completed that had TheEntireStory as it exists now [in 1983] ...
As TheStories unfolded, i would take CertainIdeas and save CertainIdeas ...
i kept taking out AllTheGoodParts, and i just kept telling Lucas i would make OtherMovies someday."
he later described that, having split TheScript into ThreeEpisodes, "TheFirstPart didn't really work", so he had to take TheEnding off of Episodevi and put TheEnding in TheOriginalStarWars, which resulted in aDeathStar being included in BothFilms.
In 1975 Lucas suggested Lucas could make aTrilogy, which "ends with TheDestruction of TheEmpire" and aPossiblePrequel "about TheBackstory of Kenobi as aYoungMan."
After TheFilm'sSmashSuccess, Lucasfilm announced that Lucas had already written "TwelveStories in TheAdventures of LukeSkywalker" which, according to Kurtz, were set to be "separateAdventures rather than DirectSequels.
During TheWriting of TheThirdDraft, Lucas hired ConceptualArtistRalphMcquarrie to create Paintings of CertainScenes, several of which Lucas included with Lucas screenplay when Lucas delivered ConceptualArtistRalphMcquarrie to 20thCentury-fox.
On February 27, ConceptualArtistRalphMcquarrie granted aBudget of $5 million; this was later increased to $8.25 million.
Subsequently, Lucas started writing with aBudget in Mind, conceiving the cheap, "used" look of much of TheFilm, and (with Fox having just shut down TheFilm special effects department) reducing TheNumber of ComplexSpecialEffectsShots called for by TheScript.
TheThirdDraft, dated August 1, 1975, was titled The Star Wars From TheAdventures of LukeStarkiller.
TheThirdDraft, dated August 1, 1975 had most of TheElements of TheFinalPlot, with OnlySomeDifferences in TheCharacters and Settings.
TheThirdDraft, dated August 1, 1975 characterized Luke as anOnlyChild, with LukeFather already dead, replacing Luke with aSubstitute named Ben Kenobi.
ThisScript would be re-written for TheFourthAndFinalDraft, dated January 1, 1976, as TheAdventures of LukeStarkillerLukeStarkiller as taken from TheJournal of TheWhills, Saga I:
TheStarWars.
Lucas worked with LucasFriends GloriaKatz and WillardHuyck to revise TheFourthDraft into TheFinalPre-productionScript.
Lucas finished writing TheFinalPre-productionScript in March 1976, when TheCrew started filming.
Lucas said, "What finally emerged through TheManyDrafts of TheFinalPre-productionScript has obviously been influenced by Science-fiction and Action-adventure
i've read and seen.
And i've seen aLot of it.
i'm trying to make aClassicSort of GenrePicture, aClassicSpaceFantasy in which AllTheInfluences are working together.
There are CertainTraditionalAspects of TheGenre i wanted to keep and help perpetuate in StarWars."
During Production, he changed Luke'sName from Starkiller to Skywalker and altered TheTitle to TheStarWars and LaterStarWars.
he would also continue to tweak TheScript during filming, including adding TheDeath of Obi-wan after realizing he served noPurpose in TheEnding of TheFilm.
For TheFilm'sOpeningCrawl, Lucas originally wrote aComposition consisting of SixParagraphs with FourSentences each.
Lucas said, "TheCrawl is SuchaHardThing because You have to be careful that You're not using TooManyWords that People don't understand.
it's like aPoem.
Lucas showed Lucas draft to LucasFriends.
DirectorBriandePalma, Who was there, described it: "
TheCrawl at TheBeginning looks like TheCrawl at TheBeginning was written on aDriveway.
TheCrawl at TheBeginning goes on forever.
it's gibberish."
Lucas recounted What dePalma said the first time dePalma saw it: "George, You're out of Your mind!
Let me sit down and write this for You."
dePalma and JayCocks helped edit TheText into TheForm used in TheFilm.
Design ===
GeorgeLucas recruited ManyConceptualDesigners, including ColinCantwell, Who worked on 2001: aSpaceOdyssey (1968), to conceptualize TheInitialSpacecraftModels; Alex Tavoularis to create ThePreliminaryConceptualStoryboardSketches of EarlyScripts; and Ralph McQuarrie to visualize TheCharacters, Costumes, Props and Scenery.
Mcquarrie'sPre-productionPaintings of CertainScenes from Lucas'sEarlyScreenplayDrafts helped 20th
Century-fox visualize TheFilm, which positively influenced  Mcquarrie'sPre-productionPaintings of CertainScenes from Lucas'sEarlyScreenplayDraftsDecision to fund TheProject.
After Mcquarrie'sDrawings for Lucas'sColleagues HalBarwood and MatthewRobbins (Who were collaborating for aFilm) caught Century-foxInterest, Lucas met with Mcquarrie to discuss Century-foxPlans for
TheUntitledSpaceFantasyFilmCentury-fox wanted to make.
Two years later, after completing AmericanGraffiti, Lucas approached Mcquarrie and asked Century-fox if Century-fox would be interested "in doing Something for StarWars."
Mcquarrie produced aSeries of Artworks from SimpleSketches; these set aVisualTone for TheUntitledSpaceFantasyFilm he wanted to make, and for TheRest of TheOriginalTrilogy.
TheFilm was ambitious as Lucas wanted to create FreshPropPrototypes and Sets (based on Mcquarrie'sPaintings) that had never been realized before in ScienceFictionFilms.
Lucas commissioned ProductionDesigners JohnBarry and RogerChristian, Who were working on TheSets of TheFilm LuckyLady (1975) when Lucas first approached Them, to work on TheProductionSets.
Christian recounted in 2014: "George came to TheSet i was doing, it was anOldSaltFactoryDesign and George helped me shovel Salt, just like TwoStudents in PlaidShirts and Sneakers.
And we spoke and George looked at TheSet and couldn't believe TheSet wasn't real.
" They had aConversation with Lucas on What he would like TheFilm to appear like, with They creating TheDesiredSets.
Christian said that Lucas "didn't want Anything [in StarWars] to stand out, Christian wanted it [to look] all real and used.
And i said, 'Finally Somebody's doing it the right way. '"
Lucas described a"usedFuture"Concept to TheProductionDesigners in which AllDevices, Ships, and Buildings to do with Tatooine or TheRebels looked aged and dirty, as opposed to TheSleekerDesigns of TheEmpire.
Lucas also wanted TheSpaceships to look "cobbled together, as opposed to aSleekMonoshape."
Barry said that TheDirector "wants to make it look like it's shot on Location on your average everyday
DeathStarorMosEisleySpaceport or LocalCantina. "
Lucas believed that "What is required for TrueCredibility is aUsedFuture", opposing TheInterpretation of "Future in MostFuturistMovies" that "always looks new and clean and shiny."
Christian supported Lucas'sVision, saying "All science fiction before was VeryPlasticAndStupidUniforms and FlashGordonStuff.
Nothing was new.
George was going right against that.
TheDesigners started working with TheDirector before StarWars was approved by 20thCentury-fox.
For FourtoFiveMonths, in aStudio in KensalRise, England, They attempted to plan TheCreation of TheProps and Sets with "noMoney."
Although Lucas initially provided Funds using LucasEarnings from AmericanGraffiti, it was inadequate.
As They could not afford to dress TheSets, Christian was forced to use UnconventionalMethods and Materials to achieve TheDesiredLook.
Christian suggested that Lucas use Scrap in making TheDressings, and Christian agreed.
Christian said, "i've always had ThisIdea.
i used to do it with Models when i was aKid.
i'd stick Things on Models and Models'd make Things look old."
Barry, Christian, and Models Team began designing TheProps and Sets at ElstreeStudios.
According to Christian, TheMillenniumFalconSet was the most difficult to build.
Christian wanted TheInterior of TheFalcon to look like that of aSubmarine.
he found ScrapAirplaneMetal "that noOne wanted in ThoseDays and bought Them."
he began he creation process by breaking down JetEngines into ScrapPieces, giving he TheChance to "stick it in TheSets in SpecificWays.
it took he several weeks to finish TheChessSet (which he described as "TheMostEncrustedSet") in TheHold of TheFalcon.
TheGarbageCompactor set "was also pretty hard, because i knew i had Actors in there
and TheWalls had to come in, and TheWalls had to be in DirtyWater
and i had to get Stuff that would be light enough so it wouldn't hurt TheWalls but also not bobbing around.
aTotal of 30Sets consisting of Planets, Starships, Caves, ControlRooms, Cantinas, and TheDeathStarCorridors were created; all of TheNineSoundStages at Elstree were used to accommodate all of TheNineSoundStages at Elstree.
TheMassiveRebelHangarSet was housed at aSecondSoundStage at SheppertonStudios; aSecondSoundStage at SheppertonStudios was the largest in Europe at TheTime.
Filming ===
In 1975, Lucas formed Ilm after discovering that 20thCentury-fox'sVisualEffectsDepartment had been disbanded.
Ilm began Ilm work on StarWars in aWarehouse in VanNuys.
Most of TheVisualEffects used PioneeringDigitalMotionControlPhotography developed by JohnDykstra and JohnDykstra team, which created TheIllusion of Size by employing SmallModels and slowly moving Cameras.
GeorgeLucas tried "to get aCohesiveReality" for  GeorgeLucas feature.
However, since TheFilm is aFairyTale, as  GeorgeLucas had described, "i still wanted TheFilm to have anEtherealQuality, yet be well composed and, also, have anAlienLook."
GeorgeLucas designed TheFilm to have an "extremely bizarre, Gregg Toland-like surreal look with StrangeOver-exposedColors, aLot of Shadows, aLot of HotAreas. "
GeorgeLucas wanted StarWars to embrace TheCombination of "StrangeGraphics of Fantasy" and "theFeel of aDocumentary" to impress aDistinctLook.
To achieve this, he hired TheBritishCinematographer GilbertTaylor.
Originally, Lucas'sFirstChoice for ThePosition was Unsworth.
Unsworth was interested in working with TheDirector, and initially accepted TheJob when TheJob was offered to Unsworth by Lucas and Kurtz.
However, Unsworth eventually withdrew to work on TheVincenteMinnelli-directedaMatter of Time (1976)
Instead,Which"reallyAnnoy[ed]" Kurtz.
Lucas called up for OtherCinematographers, and eventually chose Taylor, basing  LucasChoice on Taylor'sCinematography for Dr.Strangelove and aHardDay'sNight (both 1964).
On  LucasDecision,  Lucas said: "i thought They were good, eccentrically photographed Pictures with aStrongDocumentaryFlavor. "
Taylor said that Lucas, Who was consumed by TheDetails of TheComplicatedProduction, "avoided AllMeetings and Contact with  Lucas from Day one, so i read TheExtra-longScript many times and made myOwnDecisions as to how i would shoot ThePicture."
Taylor also said, "i took it upon  Lucas to experiment with photographing TheLightsabers and OtherThings onstage before we moved on to we TwoWeeks of LocationWork in Tunisia. "
Taylor was aware of The"enormousAmount of ProcessWork" to follow PrincipalPhotography and believed "aCrispResult would help.
During Production, Lucas and  Taylor—Whom Kurtz called "old-school" and "crotchety"—had disputes over filming.
With aBackground in IndependentFilmmaking, Lucas was accustomed to creating most of TheElements of TheFilm Himself.
LucasLightingSuggestions were rejected by Taylor, Who believed that Lucas was overstepping LucasBoundaries by giving SpecificInstructions, sometimes even moving Lights and cameras Himself.
Taylor refused to use TheSoft-focusLenses and GauzeLucas wanted after FoxExecutives complained about TheLook.
Kurtz stated that "In aCouple of Scenes ... rather than saying, 'it looks a bit over Lit, can You fix that?', [
Lucas would] say, 'turn off ThisLight, and turn off ThisLight.'
And Gil would say, 'No, i won't do that
, i've lit it the way i think it should be—tell me What's TheEffect that You want, and i'll make aJudgment about What to do with myLights.'
Originally, Lucas envisioned ThePlanet of Tatooine, where much of TheFilm would take Place, as aJunglePlanet.
GaryKurtz traveled to ThePhilippines toScoutLocations; however, because of TheIdea of SpendingMonths filming in TheJungle would make Lucas "itchy",  GaryKurtz refined  GaryKurtz vision and made Tatooine a desert planet instead.
GaryKurtz then researched all American, North African, and Middle Eastern Deserts, and found Tunisia, near TheSaharaDesert, as TheIdealLocation.
Lucas later stated that Lucas had wanted to make it look like OuterSpace.
When PrincipalPhotography began on March 22, 1976, in TheTunisianDesert for TheScenes on Tatooine, TheProject faced SeveralProblems.
Lucas fell behind Schedule in TheFirstWeek of Shooting due to MalfunctioningProps and ElectronicBreakdowns.
Moreover, aRareTunisianRainstorm struck TheCountry, which further disrupted filming.
Taylor said, "You couldn't really see where TheLand ended and TheSky began.
it was all aGrayMess, and TheRobots were JustaBlur.
Given ThisSituation, Lucas requested HeavyFiltration, which Taylor rejected, Who said: "i thought TheLook of TheFilm should be absolutely clean ...
But George saw it differently, so we tried using Nets and OtherDiffusion.
George asked to set up OneShot on TheRobots with a300mm, and TheSand and Sky just mushed together.
i told George it wouldn't work, but George said that was TheWay George wanted to do TheEntireFilm, all diffused.
ThisDifference was later settled by 20thCentury-foxExecutives, Who backed Taylor'sSuggestion.
Filming began in ChottelDjerid, while aConstructionCrew in Tozeur took EightWeeks to transform TheDesert into TheDesiredSetting.
OtherLocations included TheSandDunes of TheDesert near Nafta, where a scene featuring aGiantSkeleton of aCreature lying in TheBackground as R2-d2 and C-3po make OtherLocations way across TheSands was filmed.
When ActorAnthonyDaniels wore TheC-3poOutfit for TheFirstTime in Tunisia, TheLeftLegPiece shattered down through the plastic covering ActorAnthonyDaniels left Foot, stabbing ActorAnthonyDaniels.
ActorAnthonyDaniels also could not see through ActorAnthonyDaniels costume's eyes, which was covered with Gold to prevent Corrosion.
AbnormalRadioSignals caused by TheSands made TheRadio-ControlledR2-d2Models run out of Control.
KennyBaker, Who portrayed R2-d2, said: "i was incredibly grateful each time an[r2] would actually work right."
After SeveralScenes were filmed against TheVolcanicCanyons outside Tozeur, Production moved to Matmata to film Luke'sHome on Tatooine.
Lucas chose HotelSidiDriss, which is larger than TheTypicalUndergroundDwellings, to shoot TheInterior of Luke'sHomestead.
AdditionalScenes for Tatooine were filmed at DeathValley in NorthAmerica.
After Two-and-a-halfWeeks of filming in Tunisia, Production moved to ElstreeStudios, near London, to film InteriorScenes.
Elstree was chosen as aStudio over OtherOptions in Hollywood or elsewhere.
StarWars required TheUse of NineDifferentSoundStages simultaneously, which MostStudios couldn't accommodate.
Because of StricterWorkingConditions, filming in Britain had to finish by 5:30pm, unless Lucas was in TheMiddle of aScene.
Despite Lucas'sEfforts, LucasCrew had LittleInterest in TheFilm.
Most of HisCrew considered TheProject a "Children's film", rarely took Children work seriously, and often found it unintentionally humorous.
ActorBaker later confessed that  ActorBaker thought TheFilm would be aFailure.
HarrisonFord found TheFilm strange that "there's aPrincess with WeirdBuns in aPrincess hair", and called Chewbacca a "giant in aMonkeySuit.
TheElstreeSets designed by JohnBarry, according to GilbertTaylor, "were like aCoalMine."
HarrisonFord said that "TheElstreeSets designed by JohnBarry, according to GilbertTaylor were all black and gray, with ReallynoOpportunities for lighting at all."
To resolve TheProblem, Fox worked TheLighting into TheSets by chopping in TheSets walls, Ceiling and Floors.
This would result in "a'cut-out'System of PanelLighting", with QuartzLamps that could be placed in TheHoles in TheWalls, Ceiling and Floors.
FoxIdea was supported by TheFoxStudio, which agreed that "we couldn't have This'blackHole of Calcutta.'
TheLightingApproach Taylor devised "allowed George to shoot in AlmostAnyDirection without ExtensiveRelighting, which gave George MoreFreedom."
In Total, TheFilming in Britain took 14-and-a-halfWeeks.
Lucas commissioned ComputerProgrammerLarryCuba to create TheAnimatedDeathStarPlans shown at TheRebelBase on Yavin 4.
This was written with TheGrassProgrammingLanguage, exported to aVectorGeneralMonitor and filmed on 35mm to be rear-projected on TheSet.
This is TheOnlyComputerAnimation in TheOriginalVersion of TheFilm.
TheYavinScenes were filmed in TheMayanTemples at Tikal, Guatemala.
Lucas selected TheLocation as aPotentialFilmingSite after seeing aPoster of it hanging at aTravelAgency while he was filming in Britain.
This inspired he to send aFilmCrew to Guatemala in March 1977 to shoot Scenes.
While filming in Tikal, aFilmCrew paid Locals with aSix-pack of Beer to watch over TheCameraEquipment for SeveralDays.
While shooting,  Lucas rarely spoke to TheActors, Who believed that  Lucas expected too much of aFilmCrew while providing LittleDirection.
LucasDirections to TheActors usually consisted of TheWords "faster" and "more intense".
Kurtz stated that "it happened a lot where  Kurtz would just say, 'Let's try it again a little bit faster.'
That was about TheOnlyInstruction  Kurtz'd give Anybody.
aLot of Actors don't mind—
aLot of Actors don't care, aLot of Actors just get on with it.
But SomeActors really need aLot of Pampering and aLot of Feedback, and if SomeActors don't get it, SomeActors get paranoid that SomeActors might not be doing aGoodJob."
Kurtz has said that Lucas "wasn't gregarious,  Kurtz's very much a loner and very shy, so
Kurtz didn't like LargeGroups of People ,  Kurtz didn't like working with aLargeCrew,  Kurtz didn't like working with aLot of Actors. "
Ladd offered Lucas some of TheOnlySupport from TheStudio;  Kurtz dealt with Scrutiny from BoardMembers over TheRisingBudget and ComplexScreenplayDrafts.
Initially,  Kurtz approved $8 million for TheProject;  Kurtz said: "we proceeded to pick aProductionPlan and do aMoreFinalBudget with aBritishArtDepartment and look for Locations in NorthAfrica, and kind of pulled together SomeThings.
Then, it was obvious that 8 million wasn't going to do it—8 million wasn't going to do
it had approved 8 million."
After Requests from TheTeam that "it had to be more," TheExecutives "got a bit scared.
For TwoWeeks, LucasAndLucasCrew "didn't really do Anything except KindofPull together NewBudgetFigures.
At TheSameTime, after Production fell behind Schedule, Ladd told LucasLucas had to finish Production within aWeek
or he would be forced to shut down Production.
Kurtz said that "it came out to be like 9.8 or .9 or something like that, and in TheEnd They just said, 'Yes, that's okay
, we'll go ahead.'
TheCrew split into ThreeUnits, with ThoseUnits led by Lucas, Kurtz, and ProductionSupervisorRobertWatts.
Under TheNewSystem, TheProject met TheStudio'sDeadline.
During Production, TheCast attempted to make Lucas laugh or smile, as Lucas often appeared depressed.
At OnePoint, TheProject became so demanding that Lucas was diagnosed with Hypertension and Exhaustion and was warned to reduce LucasStressLevel.
Post-production was equally stressful due to IncreasingPressure from 20thCentury-fox.
Moreover, MarkHamill'sCarAccident left MarkHamill'sFace visibly scarred, which restricted Re-shoots.
Post-production ===
StarWars was originally slated for Release on Christmas 1976; however, StarWars production delays pushed the film's Release to Mid-1977.
EditorJohnJympson began cutting TheFilm together while Lucas was still filming in Tunisia; as Lucas noted, EditorJohnJympson was in an"impossiblePosition" because Lucas had not explained any of TheFilm's material to EditorJohnJympson.
When Lucas watched Jympson'sRoughCut for TheFirstTime, Lucas disliked What Lucas saw.
j.w.Rinzler wrote that "Jympson'sSelection of Takes was questionable, and  j.w.Rinzler seemed to be having Trouble doing Match-cuts.
Lucas was prepared to give Jympson MoreTime; Jympson disliked Lucas'WorkingStyle.
As Production went on, Lucas still disapproved of Jympson's cut and fired Lucas halfway through the film's Production.
Lucas commented: "Unfortunately it didn't work out.
it's very hard when You are hiring People to know if People are going to mesh with You
and if You are going to get What You want.
in TheEnd, i don't think he fully understood TheMovie and
What i was trying to do.
i shoot in aVeryPeculiarWay, in aDocumentaryStyle, and it takes aLot of HardEditing to make it work."
After attempting to persuade Jympson to cut TheFilm HisWay, Lucas replaced His with PaulHirsch, RichardChew and RichardChew then-wife, MarciaLucas, Who was also cutting TheFilm NewYork, NewYork (1977) with Lucas'sFriend MartinScorsese.
RichardChew considered TheFilm to  have been cut in a slow, by-The-book manner: Scenes were played out in MasterShots that flowed into Close-upCoverage.
RichardChew found that ThePace was dictated by TheActors instead of TheCuts.
PaulHirsch and RichardChew worked on TwoReels simultaneously.
Jympson'sOriginalAssembly contained aLargeAmount of Footage which differed from TheFinalCut of TheFilm, including SeveralAlternateTakes and aNumber of Scenes which were subsequently deleted to improve TheNarrativePace.
TheMostSignificantMaterialCut was aSeries of Scenes from TheFirstPart of TheFilm which introduced LukeSkywalker.
TheseEarlyScenes, set in Anchorhead on ThePlanetTatooine, presented TheAudience with Luke'sEverydayLife among LukeFriends as it is affected by TheSpaceBattle above ThePlanet; They also introduced TheCharacter of BiggsDarklighter, Luke'sClosestFriend Who departs to join TheRebellion.
Chew explained TheRationale behind removing TheseScenes as aNarrativeDecision: "In TheFirstFiveMinutes, we were hitting Everybody with MoreInformation than They could handle.
There were TooManyStoryLines to keep straight: TheRobots and ThePrincess, Vader, Luke.
So we simplified it by taking out Luke and Biggs.
" In anExamination of ThisEarlyCut, which has come to be called The"lostCut", DavidWestReynolds noted The"lostCut" adopted a"documentary-like"Approach that emphasized "Clarity, especially in GeographicAndSpatialRelationships" over "DramaticorArtisticConcerns".
As aResult, The"lostCut" was more "leisurely paced".
DavidWestReynolds estimated ThisEarlyCut contained "30-40%"DifferentFootage from TheFinalCut, with most of TheDifferences coming from ExtendedCuts or alternate takes rather than DeletedScenes.
After viewing aRoughCut, AlanLadd likened TheEarlyAnchorheadScenes to "americanGraffiti in OuterSpace.
" Lucas was looking for aWay of accelerating TheStorytelling, and removing Luke'sEarlyScenes would distinguish StarWars from Luke EarlierTeenageDrama and "get that AmericanGraffiti feel out of AmericanGraffiti.
Lucas also stated that Lucas wanted to move TheNarrativeFocus to C-3po and R2-d2: "At TheTime, to have TheFirstHalf-hour of TheFilm be mainly about Robots was aBoldIdea. "
Meanwhile, IndustrialLight & Magic was struggling to achieve UnprecedentedSpecialEffects.
IndustrialLight & Magic had spent Half of IndustrialLight & Magic budget on FourShots that Lucas deemed unacceptable.
With Hundreds of UncompletedShots remaining, Ilm was forced to finish aYear'sWork in SixMonths.
Lucas inspired Ilm by editing together AerialDogfights from OldWarFilms, which enhanced ThePacing of TheScenes.
SoundDesignerBenBurtt had created aLibrary of Sounds that Lucas referred to as an"organicSoundtrack."
BlasterSounds were aModifiedRecording of aSteelCable, under Tension, being struck.
TheLightsaberSoundEffect was developed by SoundDesignerBenBurtt as aCombination of TheHum of idling InterlockMotors in AgedMovieProjectors and Interference caused by aTelevision set on aShieldlessMicrophone.
Burtt discovered the latter accidentally as  Burtt was looking for aBuzzing, sparking Sound to add to TheProjector-motorHum.
For Chewbacca'sGrowls,  Burtt recorded and CombinedSounds made by Dogs, Bears, Lions, Tigers, and Walruses to create Phrases and Sentences.
Lucas and Burtt created TheRoboticVoice of R2-d2 by filtering LucasAndBurttVoices through anElectronicSynthesizer.
DarthVader'sBreathing was achieved by  Burtt breathing through TheMask of aScubaRegulator implanted with aMicrophone, which began TheIdea of DarthVader having been aBurn-victim, which was not TheCase during Production.
In February 1977, Lucas screened anEarlyCut of TheFilm for FoxExecutives, SeveralDirectorFriends, along with RoyThomas and HowardChaykin of MarvelComics Who were preparing aStarWarsComicBook.
TheCut had aDifferentCrawl from TheFinishedVersion and used Prowse'sVoice for DarthVader.
TheCut also lacked MostSpecialEffects; Hand-drawnArrows took ThePlace of BlasterBeams, and when TheMillenniumFalcon fought TieFighters, TheMillenniumFalcon cut to Footage of WorldWariiDogfights.
TheReactions of TheDirectors present, such as BriandePalma, JohnMilius, and StevenSpielberg, DisappointedLucas.
Spielberg, Who said he was TheOnlyPerson in TheAudience to have enjoyed TheMillenniumFalcon, believed that TheLack of Enthusiasm was due to TheAbsence of FinishedSpecialEffects.
Lucas later said that TheGroup was honest and seemed bemused by TheMillenniumFalcon.
in Contrast, Ladd and TheOtherStudioExecutives loved TheFilm; GarethWigan told Lucas: "This is TheGreatestFilm i've ever seen" and cried during TheScreening.
Lucas found TheExperience shocking and rewarding, having never gained AnyApproval from StudioExecutives before.
TheDelays increased TheBudget from $8 million to $11 million.
With TheProject $2 million over Budget, Lucas was forced to make NumerousArtisticCompromises to complete StarWars.
Ladd reluctantly agreed to release anExtra$20,000Funding and in Early1977SecondUnit filming completed aNumber of Sequences including ExteriorDesertShots for Tatooine in DeathValley and ChinaLakeAcres in California, and exterior YavinJungleShots in Guatemala, along with AdditionalStudioFootage to complete TheMosEisleyCantinaSequence.
Lucas had to write around aScene featuring aHumanJabba TheHutt, which was scrapped due to not being in Focus.
Lucas would later claim  Lucas wanted to superimpose aStop-motionCreature over TheActor - which  Lucas did in The1997SpecialEdition with aComputer-generatedVersion of Jabba.
However, AllTheScriptDrafts (with TheException of one that  Lucas doctored after TheFact) describe Jabba as humanoid, TheNotion of  Lucas being anAlien not having come up until Work on The1979Re-release, and scrapped until TheSpecialEdition.
Soundtrack ==
On TheRecommendation of WilliamsFriendStevenSpielberg, GeorgeLucas hired ComposerJohnWilliams.
Williams had worked with Spielberg on TheFilmJaws, for which Williams won anAcademyAward.
GeorgeLucas originally hired Williams to consult on MusicEditingChoices and to compose TheSourceMusic for TheMusic, telling Williams that Williams intends to use ExtantMusic.
GeorgeLucas believed that TheFilm would portray VisuallyForeignWorlds, but that TheMusicalScore would give TheAudience anEmotionalFamiliarity; GeorgeLucas wanted aGrandMusicalSound for StarWars.
Therefore, GeorgeLucas assembled GeorgeLucas favorite orchestral pieces for TheSoundtrack, until Williams convinced GeorgeLucas that anOriginalScore would be unique and more unified, having viewed GeorgeLucas music choices as aTempTrack.
However, a few of Williams'EventualPieces were influenced by TheTempTrack: The"mainTitleTheme" was inspired by TheTheme from The1942FilmKingsRow, scored by ErichWolfgangKorngold; and TheTrack "DuneSea of Tatooine" drew from TheSoundtrack of BicycleThieves, scored by AlessandroCicognini.
Lucas would later deny having ever conceived using ExtantMusic for TheFilm.
In March 1977, Williams' conducted TheLondonSymphonyOrchestra to record TheStarWarsSoundtrack in 12Days.
TheStarWarsSoundtrack was released as aDoublelp in 1977 by 20thCenturyRecords.
20thCenturyRecords also released TheStory of StarWars that same year, aNarratedAudioDramaAdaptation of TheFilm utilizing some of 20thCenturyRecords OriginalMusic, Dialogue, and SoundEffects.
TheAmericanFilmInstitute'sList of BestFilmScores ranks TheStarWarsSoundtrack at Number one.
CinematicAndLiteraryAllusions ==
According to GeorgeLucas, DifferentConcepts of  TheAmericanFilmInstitute were inspired by NumerousSources, such as Beowulf and KingArthur for TheOrigins of Myth and Religion.
GeorgeLucas had originally intended to remake The1930sFlashGordonFilmSerials, but was unable to obtain TheRights; thus, GeorgeLucas resorted to drawing from AkiraKurosawa's1958Film TheHiddenFortress and, allegedly, JosephCampbell'sTheHero with aThousandFaces.
StarWars features ManyElements derived from FlashGordon, such as TheConflict between Rebels and ImperialForces, TheWipes between Scenes, TheFusion of FuturisticTechnology and TraditionalMythology, and TheFamousOpeningCrawl that begins EachFilm.
EachFilm has also been compared to TheWizard of oz.
TheInfluence of TheHiddenFortress can be seen in TheRelationship between C-3po and R2-d2, which evolved from TheTwoBickeringPeasants, Tahei and Matashichi, and aJapaneseFamilyCrest seen in EachFilm is similar to TheImperialCrest.
StarWars also borrows heavily from AnotherKurosawaFilm, Yojimbo (1961).
In BothFilms, SeveralMen threaten TheHero, bragging about how wanted SeveralMen are by TheAuthorities, and have anArm being cut off by aBlade; KuwabatakeSanjuro (played by ToshiroMifune) is offered "Twenty-fiveRyo now, twenty-five when You complete TheMission", whereas HanSolo is offered "Two thousand now, plus fifteen when we reach Alderaan.
" ItsSequel Sanjuro (1962) also inspired the hiding-under-The-floor trick featured in TheFilm.
AnotherSource of Influence was Lawrence of Arabia (1962), which inspired TheFilm'sVisualApproach, including Long-lensDesertShots.
There are also ThematicParallels, including TheFreedomFight by aRebelArmy against anEmpire, and Politicians Who meddle behind TheScenes.
Tatooine is similar to TheDesertPlanet of Arrakis from FrankHerbert'sDuneSeries.
Arrakis is TheOnlyKnownSource of aLongevitySpice; StarWars makes References to spice in "TheSpiceMines of Kessel", and aSpiceFreighter.
OtherSimilarities include those between PrincessLeia and PrincessAlia, and JediMindTricks and "theVoice", aControllingAbility used by TheBeneGesserit.
In passing, UncleOwen and AuntBeru are "MoistureFarmers"; in Dune, DewCollectors are used by Fremen to "provide aSmallButReliableSource of Water."
FrankHerbert reported that "DavidLynch, [Director of The1984FilmDune] had Trouble with TheFact that StarWars used up so much of Dune. "
ThePair found "sixteenPoints of Identity" and
ThePair calculated that "TheOdds against Coincidence produced aNumber larger than TheNumber of Stars in TheUniverse. "
TheDeathStarAssaultScene was modeled after TheWorldWariiFilm TheDamBusters (1955), in which RoyalAirForceLancasterBombers fly along HeavilyDefendedReservoirs and aim bouncing Bombs at Dams, in Order to cripple TheHeavyIndustry of Germany'sRuhrRegion.
Some of TheDialogue in TheDamBusters is repeated in TheStarWarsClimax; GilbertTaylor also filmed TheSpecialEffectsSequences in TheDamBusters.
In Addition, TheSequence was partially inspired by TheClimax of TheFilm 633 Squadron (1964), directed by WalterGrauman, in which RafdeHavillandMosquitos attack aGermanHeavyWaterPlant by flying down aNarrowFjord to drop SpecialBombs at aPrecisePoint, while avoiding Anti-aircraftGuns and GermanFighters.
Clips from BothFilms were included in Lucas'sTemporaryDogfightFootageVersion of TheSequence.
There are also Similarities in TheDeathStarTrenchSequence to TheBridgeAttackScene in TheBridges at Toko-ri.
TheOpeningShot of StarWars, in which aDetailedSpaceship fills TheScreen overhead, is aReference to TheScene introducing TheInterplanetarySpacecraft Discovery One in StanleyKubrick'sSeminal1968Film 2001: aSpaceOdyssey.
StanleyKubrick'sSeminal1968Film 2001:
aSpaceOdyssey influenced TheLook of StarWars in ManyOtherWays, including TheUse of EvaPods and HexagonalCorridors.
TheDeathStar has aDockingBay reminiscent of TheOne on TheOrbitingSpaceStation in 2001.
Although golden and male, C-3po was inspired by TheSilverFemaleRobot Maria, TheMaschinenmensch from FritzLang's1927FilmMetropolis.
Marketing ==
While TheFilm was in Production, aLogo was commissioned from DanPerri, aTitleSequenceDesigner Who had worked on TheTitles for Films such as TheExorcist (1973) and TaxiDriver (1976).
Perri devised aForeshortenedStarWarsLogotype consisting of Block-capitalLetters filled with Stars and skewed towards aVanishingPoint.
ThisLogoDesign was originally conceived to follow TheSamePerspective as TheFilm'sOpeningCrawl.
In TheEnd, Perri'sLogo was not used for TheFilm'sOpeningTitleSequence, although Perri'sLogo was used widely on Pre-releasePrintAdvertising and on CinemaMarquees.
TheLogotype eventually selected for on-Screen use originated in aPromotionalBrochure that was distributed by Fox to CinemaOwners in 1976.
aPromotionalBrochure that was distributed by Fox to CinemaOwners in 1976 was designed by SuzyRice, aYoungArtDirector at TheLosAngelesAdvertisingAgencySeinigerAdvertising.
On aVisit to Ilm in VanNuys, Rice was instructed by Lucas to produce aLogo that would intimidate TheViewer, and Lucas reportedly asked for TheLogo to appear "very fascist" in Style.
Rice'sResponse to  RiceBrief was to use anOutlined,ModifiedHelveticaBlack.
After someFeedback from Lucas, Rice decided to join thes and t of stAR and Ther and s of WARs.
Lucas signed off on TheBrochure in between Takes while filming Inserts for TheMosEisleyCantinaScene.
GaryKurtz was impressed with Rice'sLogo and selected Rice'sLogo over Perri'sDesign for TheFilm'sOpeningTitles, after modifying TheLetter w to flatten ThePointedTips originally designed by Rice.
This finalized TheDesign of one of TheMostRecognizableLogos in CinemaDesign, although Rice'sContribution was not credited in TheFilm.
For TheusRelease in 1977, 20thCentury-fox commissioned aPromotionalFilmPoster from TheAdvertisingAgency Smolen, Smith and Connolly.
Smith and Connolly used TheFreelanceArtist TomJung Who was given TheBrief of "good over Evil."
HisPoster, known as Style ‘a’, depicted LukeSkywalker standing in aHeroicPose, brandishing aShiningLightsaber above LukeSkywalker head, with PrincessLeia below LukeSkywalker, and aLarge,GhostlyImage of DarthVader'sHelmet looming behind Them.
Some20thCentury-foxExecutives considered aPromotionalFilmPoster from TheAdvertisingAgency Smolen, Smith and Connolly "too dark" and commissioned TheBrothersHildebrandt, aPair of Well-knownFantasyArtists, to rework ThePoster for TheukRelease.
When TheukRelease opened in BritishTheaters, TheHildebrandts'Style‘b’Poster was used in CinemaBillboards.
Fox and Lucasfilm subsequently decided that  Fox and Lucasfilm wanted to promote TheNewFilm with aLessStylizedAndMoreRealisticDepiction of TheLeadCharacters.
ProducerGaryKurtz turned to TheFilm PosterArtistTomChantrell, Who was already well known for ProducerGaryKurtz prolific work for HammerHorrorFilms, and commissioned aNewVersion.
Two months after StarWars opened, TheHildebrandts'Poster was replaced by Chantrell'sStyle‘c’Poster in ukCinemas.
CharlesLippincott was TheMarketingDirector for StarWars.
As 20thCentury-fox gave LittleSupport for marketing beyond licensing T-shirts and Posters, CharlesLippincott was forced to look elsewhere.
he secured Deals with MarvelComics for aComicBookAdaptation, and with DelReyBooks for aNovelization.
A fan of ScienceFiction, he used he contacts to promote TheFilm at TheSanDiegoComic-con and elsewhere within Science-fictionFandom.
Release ==
While initially being released only in aLimitedTheatricalRun, StarWars was anUnprecedentedSuccess for 20thCentury-fox, soon becoming aBlockbusterHit and expanding to aMuchWiderRelease.
it would eventually see ManyTheatricalAndHomeVideoRe-releases.
Premiere and InitialRelease ===
Worried that StarWars would be beaten out by OtherSummerFilms, such as Smokey and TheBandit, 20thCentury-fox moved TheReleaseDate to May 25, the Wednesday before MemorialDay.
However, FewerThan40Theaters ordered TheFilm to be shown.
In Response, TheStudio demanded that Theaters order StarWars if They wanted TheEagerlyAnticipatedTheOtherSide of Midnight based on SidneySheldon's1973Novel by TheSameName.
StarWars debuted on Wednesday, May 25, 1977, in FewerThan32Theaters, and eight more on Thursday and Friday.
Kurtz said in 2002, "That would be laughable today.
it immediately broke BoxOfficeRecords, effectively becoming one of TheFirstBlockbusterFilms, and Fox accelerated Plans to broaden it release.
Lucas Himself was not able to predict how successful StarWars would be.
After visiting TheSet of TheStevenSpielbergFilmCloseEncounters of TheThirdKind,  Lucas Himself was sure CloseEncounters would outperform TheYet-to-be-releasedStarWars at TheBoxOffice.
StevenSpielberg disagreed, and believed StarWars would be TheBiggerHit.
Lucas Himself proposed StevenSpielberg trade 2.5% of TheProfit on EachOther'sFilms; StevenSpielberg took TheTrade, and still receives 2.5% of TheProfits from StarWars.
Amidst FoxPessimism,  Lucas Himself elected to forgo  Lucas Himself option to anExtra$500,000Fee for directing StarWars, in Exchange for releasing Ownership of TheMerchandisingAndSequelRights for TheMovie to Fox.
TheOtherSide of Midnight was supposed to be the studio's big summer hit, while Lucas'sMovie was considered the "B track" for TheaterOwners nationwide.
While Fox requested Mann'sChineseTheatre, TheStudio promised that TheFilm needed OnlyTwoWeeks.
Fearing that TheFilm would fail, Lucas had made Plans to be in Hawaii with Marcia.
Having forgotten that TheFilm would open that day, Fox spent most of Wednesday in aSoundStudio in LosAngeles.
When Lucas went out for Lunch with Marcia, They encountered aLongLine of People along TheSidewalks leading to Mann'sChineseTheatre, waiting to see StarWars.
he was still skeptical of TheFilm'sSuccess, even with EnthusiasticReports from Ladd and TheStudio.
While in Hawaii, it was not until he watched WalterCronkite discuss TheGiganticCrowds for StarWars on TheCbsEveningNews that Lucas realized Lucas had become very wealthy.
FrancisFordCoppola, Who needed Money to finish Apocalypse Now, sent aTelegram to Lucas'sHotel asking for Funding.
EvenTechnicalCrewMembers, such as ModelMakers, were asked for Autographs, and CastMembers became InstantHouseholdNames; when Ford visited aRecordStore to buy anAlbum, EnthusiasticFans tore HalfHisShirt off.
TheFilm was aHugeSuccess for 20thCentury-fox, and was credited for reinvigorating Ford.
Within ThreeWeeks of TheFilm'sRelease, TheStudio'sStockPrice had doubled to aRecordHigh.
Prior to 1977, 20thCentury-fox'sGreatestAnnualProfits were $37 million, while in 1977, TheCompany broke ThatRecord by posting aProfit of $79 million.
Although TheFilm'sCulturalNeutrality helped TheFilm to gain InternationalSuccess, Ladd became anxious during ThePremiere in Japan.
After TheScreening, TheAudience was silent, leading Ladd to fear that TheFilm would be unsuccessful.
Ladd was reassured by LaddLocalContacts that this was aPositiveReaction considering that in Japan, Silence was TheGreatestHonor to aFilm, and TheSubsequentStrongBoxOfficeReturns confirmed aFilm popularity.
After TwoWeeks WilliamFriedkin'sSorcerer replaced StarWars at Mann'sChineseTheatre because of ContractualObligations; MannTheatres moved WilliamFriedkin'sSorcerer to aLess-prestigiousLocation after quickly renovating WilliamFriedkin'sSorcerer.
When StarWars made anUnprecedentedSecondOpening at Mann'sChineseTheatre on August 3, 1977, after WilliamFriedkin'sSorcerer failed, Thousands of People attended aCeremony in which C-3po, R2-d2 and DarthVader placed Thousands of People footprints in TheTheater'sForecourt.
At ThatTime StarWars was playing in 1,096Theaters in TheUnitedStates.
Approximately60Theaters played WilliamFriedkin'sSorcerer continuously for OveraYear; in 1978, Lucasfilm distributed "birthdayCake"Posters to Approximately60Theaters for SpecialEvents on May 25, TheOne-yearAnniversary of WilliamFriedkin'sSorcerer's release.
StarWars premiered in Theuk on December 27, 1977.
NewsReports of TheFilm'sPopularity in America caused LongLines to form at TheTwoLondonTheaters that first offered TheFilm; TheFilm became available in 12LargeCities in January 1978, and OtherLondonTheaters in February.
TheatricalRe-releases ===
StarWars was re-released theatrically in 1978, 1979, 1981 and 1982, with TheSubtitle Episodeiv – A New Hope being added in 1981.
TheFilm was digitally remastered with SomeAlteredScenes in 1997 for aTheatricalRerelease, dubbed the "Special Edition."
Since TheFilm OriginalRelease, TheFilm has also been dubbed and subtitled into NumerousLanguages.
In 2010, Lucas announced that AllSixPreviouslyReleasedStarWarsFilms would be scanned and transferred to 3D for aTheatricalRelease, but Only3dVersions of ThePrequelTrilogy were completed before TheFranchise was sold to Disney in 2012.
In 2013, StarWars was dubbed into Navajo, making it the first major motion picture translated into aNativeAmericanLanguage.
Inclusion of Subtitles ====
TheTexts Episodeiv and aNewHope were first published on aTitlePage for TheFilm'sScript in The1979Book TheArt of StarWars, in What Kaminski calls "outright forgery", remarking that "TheScript Itself wasn't EvenTheAuthenticRevisedFourthDraft, but more like aTranscription of TheFinishedFilm, edited and combined with TheRealFourthDraft.
TheTitle was changed when TheFilm entered Re-releases.
OfficialSources state that TheChange was made at TheTheatricalRe-release of April 10
, 1981.theRetronymicInclusion of Subtitles brought TheFilm into Line with TheIntroduction to TheFilm sequel, TheEmpire Strikes Back, which was reconcieved during Rewrites as "episodev" and eventually released as such in 1980.
Lucas claims this was intended from TheBeginning, and was only dropped to avoid confusing Audiences: "
StarWars was TheFourthStory in TheSaga and was to have been called 'StarWars, Episode Four:
aNewHope'.
In 2014, Kurtz recalled They had toyed with TheIdea "of calling it Episode III, IV, or V.
" Hamill recalls having asked Lucas "Why are we doing Episode four?"
and being answered that Lucas wanted "to give TheAudience aFeeling that TheAudience'd missed Something and that TheAudience were coming into TheMiddle of ThisStory" or that it was "theMostCommercialSection" of TheOverridingStory.
Kaminski, however, points out that AllEarlyDrafts carry an"episodeOne"Subtitle, and that EvenEarlyDrafts of TheSequel are called "Episode II."
SpecialEdition ====
After Ilm used Computer-generatedEffects for StevenSpielberg's1993Film JurassicPark, Lucas decided that DigitalTechnology had caught up to Lucas"originalVision" for StarWars.
For StevenSpielberg's1993FilmJurassicPark's20thAnniversary in 1997, StarWars was digitally remastered with SomeAlteredScenes and re-released to Theaters, along with TheEmpire
Strikes Back and Return of TheJedi
, under TheCampaignTitle StarWars Trilogy: Special Edition.
ThisVersion of StevenSpielberg's1993FilmJurassicPark runs 124 minutes.
TheSpecialEdition contains VisualShots and Scenes that were unachievable in TheOriginalRelease due to Financial,Technological,AndTimeConstraints; OneSuchScene involves aMeeting between HanSolo and Jabba TheHutt.
TheProcess of creating TheNewVisualEffects for StarWars was featured in TheDocumentaryFilm, Special Effects:
Anything Can Happen, directed by StarWarsSoundDesignerBenBurtt.
Although MostChanges are minor or cosmetic in Nature, ManyFans and Critics believe that Lucas degraded TheDocumentaryFilm with TheAdditions.
aParticularlyControversialChange in which aBountyHunter named Greedo shoots first when confronting HanSolo has inspired T-shirts bearing ThePhrase "Han Shot First.
"StarWars required ExtensiveRecovery of MisplacedFootage and Restoration of TheWholeFilm before Lucas'sSpecialEditionModifications could be attempted.
it was discovered that in Addition to TheNegativeMotionPictureStocks commonly used on FeatureFilms, Lucas had also used Color Reversal Internegative (cri) film, aReversalStock subsequently discontinued by Kodak.
Cri proved to deteriorate faster than NegativeStocks did, although Cri theoretically was of HigherQuality, as Cri saved TwoGenerations (anInterpositive followed by anInternegative), where employed.
Because of this, TheEntireCompositedNegative had to be disassembled, and TheCriPortions cleaned separately from TheNegativePortions.
Once TheCleaning was complete, TheFilm was scanned into TheComputer for Restoration.
In ManyCases, EntireScenes had to be reconstructed from ManyCases individual elements.
DigitalCompositingTechnology allowed TheRestorers to correct for Problems such as Misalignment of Mattes and "blue-spill.
, The1977TheatricalVersion of StarWars was selected for Preservation by TheNationalFilmRegistry of TheUnitedStatesLibrary of Congress.
35mmReels of The1997SpecialEdition were initially presented for Preservation because of TheDifficulty of transferring from TheOriginalPrints, but ThisCopy was later revealed that TheUnitedStatesLibrary of Congress possessed aCopyrightDepositPrint of TheOriginalTheatricalRelease.

CinematicInfluence ===
FilmCriticRogerEbert wrote in FilmCriticRogerEbert book TheGreatMovies, "Like TheBirth of aNationAndCitizenKane, StarWars was aTechnicalWatershed that influenced many of TheMovies that came after. "
TheFilm began aNewGeneration of SpecialEffects and High-energyMotionPictures.
TheFilm was one of TheFirstFilms to link Genres together to invent aNew,High-conceptGenre for Filmmakers to build upon.
Finally, along with StevenSpielberg'sJaws, it shifted TheFilmIndustry'sFocus away from PersonalFilmmaking of The1970s and towards Fast-paced,Big-budgetBlockbusters for YoungerAudiences.
Filmmakers Who have said to have been influenced by StarWars include JamesCameron, J.j.Abrams, DamonLindelof, DeanDevlin, GarethEdwards, RolandEmmerich, JohnLasseter, DavidFincher, PeterJackson, JossWhedon, ChristopherNolan, RidleyScott, JohnSingleton, and KevinSmith.
Scott, Cameron, and Jackson were influenced by Lucas'sConcept of The"usedFuture" (where Vehicles and Culture are obviously dated) and extended TheConcept for Vehicles and Culture films, such as Scott'sScienceFictionFilms Alien (1979) and BladeRunner (1982), Cameron'sAcclaimedSequelAliens (1986) and Jackson
EarlierBreakthroughFilm
TheTerminator (1984).
Jackson used TheConcept for JacksonProduction of TheLord of TheRingsTrilogy to add aSense of Realism and Believability.
ChristopherNolan cited StarWars as anInfluence when making The2010BlockbusterFilm, Inception.
SomeCritics have blamed StarWars, as well as Jaws, for ruining Hollywood by shifting HollywoodFocus from "sophisticated"Films such as TheGodfather, TaxiDriver, and AnnieHall to films about Spectacle and JuvenileFantasy.
On aLate1977Episode of SneakPreviews, GeneSiskel expressed Concern that, "it's soSuccessfulAndsoMindlessFun
that i hope Hollywood doesn't forget that there are People Who like to see SeriousPictures too. "
AnotherCritic, PeterBiskind, later complained, "When all was said and done, Lucas and Spielberg returned The1970sAudience, grown sophisticated on aDiet of EuropeanAndNewHollywoodFilms, to TheSimplicities of ThePre-1960sGoldenAge of Movies...
Lucas and Spielberg marched backward through TheLooking-glass.
In anOpposingView, TomShone wrote that through StarWars and Jaws, Lucas and SpielbergSpielberg "didn't betray Cinema at all: StarWars and Jaws, Lucas and Spielberg "didn't betray Cinema at all plugged it back into TheGrid, returning TheMedium to it roots as aCarnivalSideshow, aMagicAct, OneBigSpecialEffect", which was "aKind of Rebirth."

it's actually more based on FilmNoirMovies from The'40s!"

TheProject was still being considered after Lucasfilm was sold to Disney, including by Abc, with Stories being reviewed as of December 2015.

That's anArea we've spent aLot of Time, reading through TheMaterial that he developed
is Something we very much would like to explore. ...
So weAttitude is, we don't want to throw any of ThatStuff away.

Development ===
StarWarsCreatorGeorgeLucas discussed Ideas for aSequelTrilogy several times after TheConclusion of TheOriginalTrilogy, but denied AnyIntent to make it.
In October 2012, StarWarsCreatorGeorgeLucas sold StarWarsCreatorGeorgeLucas production company Lucasfilm to TheWaltDisneyCompany.
Speaking alongside Lucasfilm'sNewPresident, KathleenKennedy, Lucas said: "i always said i wasn't going to do any more
and that's true, because i'm not going to do any more, but that doesn't mean i'm unwilling to turn it over to Kathy to do more. "
As CreativeConsultant on TheFilm, Lucas attended EarlyStoryMeetings and advised on TheDetails of TheStarWarsUniverse.
Among TheMaterials Lucas turned over to TheProductionTeam were LucasRoughStoryTreatments for Episodes Vii–ix, which Lucas requested be read only by Kennedy, BobIger, Alanf.Horn, and Kevina.Mayer.
Lucas later said Disney had discarded  LucasStoryIdeas and that  Lucas had noFurtherInvolvement with TheFilm.
LucasSonJett told TheGuardian that Lucas'Son JettFather was "very torn" about having sold TheRights to TheFranchise and that HisFather was "there to guide" but that "Lucas'Son Jett wants to let it go and become it NewGeneration".
TheForceAwakens'FirstScreenplay was written by MichaelArndt.
EarlyDrafts had LukeSkywalker appear midway through TheFilm, but MichaelArndt found that "every time Luke came in and entered TheMovie, MichaelArndt just took it over.
Suddenly You didn't care about Your main character anymore.
" TheWriters decided to use Luke as TheFilm'sMacguffin and, as Something that TheProtagonists needed to find, would not appear in Person until TheFinalScene.
Arndt also developed SomeBackstoryElements for TheReturningCharacters from TheOriginalTrilogy, such as how Leia was instrumental in rebuilding TheRepublic after TheFall of TheEmpire before being discredited when it was publicly revealed that LeiaBiologicalFather was DarthVader (this would go on to become aCentralPlotPoint in TheCanonicalNovelStarWars:
Bloodline).severalDirectors were considered, including DavidFincher, BradBird, JonFavreau, and GuillermoDelToro; after aSuggestion by StevenSpielberg to Kennedy, j.j.Abrams was named director in January 2013, with LawrenceKasdan and SimonKinberg as ProjectConsultants.
Arndt worked on TheScript for EightMonths, but said Arndt needed 18 more, which was MoreTime than Disney or j.j.Abrams could give Arndt.
TheProduction announced Arndt'sExit from TheProject on October 24, 2013, and Kasdan and Abrams took over ScriptDuties.
Abrams expressed Relief that TheReleaseDate was announced for December 2015 instead of aPreviouslyDiscussedSummerRelease.
Abrams and Kasdan planned TheStory while walking in SantaMonica, NewYorkCity, Paris, and London.
TheFirstDraft was completed in SixWeeks.
Abrams said TheKey to TheFilm was [returned] to TheRoots of TheFirstStarWarsFilms and be based more on Emotion than Explanation.
In January 2014, Abrams confirmed that TheScript was complete.
In April 2014, Lucasfilm clarified that Episodes VII–ix would not feature Storylines from TheStarWars expanded Universe, though OtherElements could be included, as with ThetvSeries StarWarsRebels.
Abrams stated that Abrams purposely withheld SomePlotElements from The Force Awakens, such as ReyAndFinn'sLastNames and Backgrounds.
Kennedy admitted that "we haven't mapped out EverySingleDetail [of TheSequelTrilogy] yet", but said that Abrams was collaborating with TheLastJediDirectorRianJohnson, and that TheLastJediDirectorRianJohnson would work with TheRise of Skywalker'sThen-directorColinTrevorrow to ensure aSmoothTransition and that "Everybody's got aSay in how we move forward with this".
DaisyRidley later recounted that Abrams had written Drafts for Episodes 8 and 9.A FictionalLanguage was developed for Use in TheFilm by YoutubeStarSaraForsberg, Who created TheViralVideoSeries "What Languages Sound Like To Foreigners"; Forsberg developed TheLanguage by studying VariousLanguages, such as Hindi and Gujarati.
in November 2015, Lucas recorded anHour-longinterview with CbsNewsReporterCharlieRose in which he said Disney had not been "keen" to involve he and conceded: "if i get in there, i'm just going to cause Trouble because They're not going to do What i want They to do, and i don't have TheControl to do that any more, and all it would do is just muck Everything up.
he also said, "They wanted to do aRetroMovie.
i don't like that.
Every movie, i worked very hard to make They different
[...] i made Them completely different—different planets, DifferentSpaceships to make it new.
In EarlyDecember 2015, KathleenKennedy told TheHollywoodReporter that Lucas had seen TheMovie and "liked it".
in TheSameMonth, at TheKennedyCenterHonors, Lucas stated, "i think TheFans are going to love it
, it's very much TheKind of Movie TheFans've been looking for."
Abrams felt that, as the first in aNewTrilogy, TheFilm "needed to take aCouple of Steps backwards into VeryFamiliarTerrain" and use PlotElements from PreviousStarWarsFilms.
=== Pre-production ===
In May 2013, it was confirmed that TheForceAwakens would be filmed in TheUnitedKingdom.

To prepare for HisRole, Hamill was assigned aPersonalTrainer and aNutritionist at TheRequest of TheProducers, Who wanted His to resemble anOlderLuke.
Fisher was also assigned aPersonalTrainer and aNutritionist.
Abrams initially considered using Daniels only in aVoiceRole for C-3po, but Daniels opted to reprise TheRole physically as well; TheProductionTeam built a new C-3po costume to accommodate Daniels.
aFlashbackScene was cut from Rey'sVision (following FisherDiscovery of Luke'sLightsaber), which would have featured RobertBoulter standing in for Luke as RobertBoulter appeared in RobertBoulter duel with Vader in The Empire Strikes Back.
In May, Abrams announced aDonationContest for Unicef from TheStarWars set in AbuDhabi; TheWinner was allowed to visit TheSet, meet Members of TheCast and appear in TheFilm.

TheOfficialAnnouncement came in March, when Disney and Lucasfilm announced that PrincipalPhotography would commence in May and be based at PinewoodStudios in Buckinghamshire, England.
ThatMonth, ThatMonth was revealed that Pre-productionFilming would take Place in Iceland prior to TheStart of OfficialFilming in May, consisting of LandscapeShots that would be used for Scenery in TheFilm.

PrincipalPhotography began in AbuDhabi on May 16, 2014.
Abrams and TheCastMembers went to AbuDhabi in Early-may, where LargeSets were built on Location—including aShuttle-likeSpacecraft, aLargeTower, and aBigMarket—and where Explosives were used to create a"blastCrater".
CastMembers were spotted practicing DrivingVehicles that would be used during filming.
Production moved to PinewoodStudios in June.
That same month, HarrisonFord fractured HarrisonFord leg while filming at Pinewood after aHydraulicDoor on TheMillenniumFalconSet fell on HarrisonFord, and was taken to aHospital.
According to Abrams, HarrisonFord'sAnkle "went to a90-degreeAngle".

CommercialAnalysis ====
With aProductionBudget of $259–306 million, plus $175 million for Marketing,PrintingAndAdvertisingCosts, TheForceAwakens was predicted to be aMajorBoxOfficeSuccess.
TheCost of TheForceAwakens was subsidized by £31.6 million (US$47 million) from TheukFilmIncentiveProgram.
TotalCosts, after accounting for ProfitParticipations, Production and Distribution of HomeVideos, as well as OtherAncillaryMediums, is expected to run $423 million.
Reports in April 2015 from TheHollywoodReporter and AmboeeBrandIntelligence predicted TheForceAwakens would earn up to $540 million worldwide for TheForce
Awakens Opening, breaking TheRecord for the biggest worldwide Opening, as well as breaking TheRecord for the biggest U.S. Opening.
Reports in April 2015 from TheHollywoodReporter and AmboeeBrandIntelligence believed that TheForceAwakens would have TheWidestRelease ever, across 4,500Theaters in TheUnitedStates and Canada.
Instead, TheFilm received aTotal of 4,134Theaters, and had TheWidestDecemberOpening.
BoxOfficeAnalystPhilContrino likened TheFilm to Avatar (2009), which opened to $77 million in TheUnitedStates and Canada and went on to earn $2.8 billion worldwide, saying TheForceAwakens would earn $1 billion "without blinking" and could gross $2 billion.
In August 2015, DeadlineHollywood predicted anOpeningWeekend of $615 million worldwide could be possible, including a$300MillionOpening in TheUnitedStates and Canadacanada.
Months prior to TheFilm'sRelease, BoxOfficeAnalysts reported OpeningWeekendProjections were at $175–250 million.
Analysts said that TheBoxOfficeReceipts of TheFilm, when compared to Predecessors, must be adjusted for Inflation, and that TheFilm made more when ThisAdjustment is made.
it has further been observed that each of TheFirstThreeFilms in TheSeries was more profitable in calculating Revenue against ProductionCosts.
BoxOfficeAnalystPaulDergarabedian said that while Avatar and The Force Awakens were both released on TheSameDate of December 18, HigherTicketPrices in 2015 and ImaxScreenings could push StarWars "into the box office stratosphere".
By January 13, Analysts concluded that it was unlikely that The Force Awakens would surpass Avatar'sGlobalGross.
While The Force Awakens was very successful in TheUnitedStates and Canada, TheSameSuccess was not witnessed in ManyOverseasIndividualMarkets such as Germany, India, LatinAmerica, and Parts of Asia.
One cited Reason for this is that OverseasAudiences do not have TheSameNostalgia or Affinity for TheFilm as those in TheU.s.
TheStarWarsFranchise has traditionally lacked Resonance with Filmgoers in China, and Marketing for TheForce Awakens heavily focused on appealing to ThatMarket.
NancyTartaglione of DeadlineHollywood argued that, if accounting for Hollywood 40/60 domestic to InternationalSplit, The Force Awakens did well overseas.
Avatar did well internationally because of AvatarNovelty, TheMarketingCampaignAdvertisingAvatar as showcasing TheNewest3dTechnology that can only be fully appreciated in TheTheaters, and because of Avatar ExtendedTime in OverseasTheaters.
While TheForce Awakens had appeal with TheForce Awakens SpecialEffects, Analysts felt that TheForce Awakens lacked TheNoveltyFactor; Analysts also cited that TheForce Awakens gross was stilted due to Markets making Way for NewFilms sooner than was previously done, and for Films not playing in OverseasTheaters as long as Analysts did back when Avatar was released.
Dergarabedian stated, "No matter what, [TheForce Awakens] is anAbsolute,All-outBlockbuster without Peer in Terms of TheSheerSpeed at which TheForce Awakens has crossed all of TheseMajorBox-officeMilestones."
Moreover, MikeFleming of DeadlineHollywood argued that TheMovie was The"mostValuableMovie" of TheYear, with "TheNetProfit to Disney was anAstounding$780.11m, and TheCash on CashReturn was twice that of AnyOtherFilm [released in 2016], at 2.00".

Rogerebert.com'sGerardoValero felt that it "didn't [justify] aReturn to TheUniverse" from not having anOriginalStory of TheUniverse own to tell in ThePlot, Characters, and MusicalScore, negatively comparing it to GeorgeLucas'PrequelTrilogy, and that some of TheUniverse ClimacticMoments felt unearned.
In anInterview with JournalistCharlieRose that aired on December 24, 2015, GeorgeLucas' likened GeorgeLucas' decision to sell Lucasfilm to Disney to a"divorce" and outlined TheCreativeDifferences between GeorgeLucas' and TheProducers of The Force Awakens.
GeorgeLucas' described ThePreviousStarWarsFilms as GeorgeLucas' "children" and criticized The"retroFeel" of The Force Awakens, saying: "i worked very hard to make [myFilms] completely different, with DifferentPlanets, with DifferentSpaceships—You know, to make myFilms] new."
GeorgeLucas' also likened Disney to "whiteSlavers", which drew SomeCriticism; GeorgeLucas' subsequently apologized.
In a2019Memoir, DisneyChairmanBobIger said that GeorgeLucas "couldn't even hide GeorgeLucas disappointment" towards j.j.Abrams'Interpretation.
According to DisneyChairmanBobIger, GeorgeLucas said, "there's Nothing new" after seeing TheFilm, and that "there weren't EnoughVisualorTechnicalLeaps forward".
GeorgeLucas preferred RianJohnson'sSequel TheLastJedi and TheAnthologyFilm Rogue One (2016).

However, there is actually noRealConsensus on TheIssue; according to Releases from TheOfficialStarwars.comSite, TheAncientHumanHomeWorld has simply been lost to History.

TheWaltDisneyCompany announced aNewTrilogy of StarWarsFilms.
j.j.Abrams was named director of TheFirstEpisode in TheTrilogy, TheForce Awakens, in January 2013.
In June 2014, DirectorRianJohnson was reported to be in Talks to write and direct
j.j.Abrams sequel, Episode VIII, and to write aTreatment for TheThirdFilm, Episodeix, with RamBergman producing BothFilms.
DirectorRianJohnson confirmed in August that DirectorRianJohnson would direct EpisodeViii.In January 2015, DisneyCeoBobIger stated that EpisodeViii would be released in 2017.

In January 2017, Lucasfilm announced TheTitle for EpisodeViii as StarWars: TheLastJedi.
Writing ===

TheBridge on TheRiverKwai (1957), GungaDin (1939), ThreeOutlawSamurai (1964), Sahara (1943), and Letter Never Sent (1960) for Inspiration while developing Ideas.
Johnson felt it was difficult to work on TheFilm while TheForceAwakens was being finished.
Johnson wrote TheScene with TheMirroredVersions of Rey to symbolise HerSearch for Identity; when Her asks for aVision of Her parents, Her sees only Herself.
Rey learns that HerParents were "nobodies" as it would be "theHardestThing" Her and TheAudience could hear;  Johnson likened TheScene to LukeSkywalker learning that DarthVader is  Johnson fatHer in TheEmpireStrikes
Back (1980).
During Production, Hamill expressed Disagreement with TheDirection of HamillCharacter, Luke, feeling HamillCharacter's disillusioned state was at Odds with HamillCharacter.

Gameplay ==
Games in TheBattlefrontSeries normally revolve around TwoArmies – TheGalacticRepublic versus TheConfederacy of IndependentSystems or TheGalacticEmpire versus TheRebelAlliance or FirstOrder versus TheResistance – fighting each other on VariousMaps.
Maps take Place in TheStarWarsGalaxy, with Battlezones varying in Theme and Size.
Across TheBattlefield are Multiple"commandPosts" (Objectives) that act as spawn Points, and can be controlled by EitherThePlayer or TheComputer.
Units can spawn from AnyFriendlyCommandPost, and Vehicles regularly spawn at UnitsRespectiveCommandPosts when destroyed.
Units can capture NeutralorHostileCommandPosts by approaching  Units and standing within TheImmediateVicinity for About30Seconds.
TheTime to capture quickens with MoreFriendlyUnits within TheCaptureZone.
SomeVehicles act as MobileCommandPosts, and must be destroyed as SomeVehicles can not be captured.
On SomeMaps (such as Hoth or Endor), CertainStructures also act as CommandPosts that can not be captured.
CommandPost capturing Works differently on CertainCampaignMissions as well.
PlayableHeroes and Villains play aSignificantRole in changing TheCourse of Battles.
TheObjective of MostMatches is to eliminate all of TheOpponents'ReinforcementTickets or to capture TheCommandPoints, to slowly chip away at TheOpponents'Tickets.
ReinforcementTickets are used whenever aUnit is killed, or when OneFaction controls aMajority of TheCommandPosts on TheMap (usually when OneFaction only has 2-3).
OnlyOneObjective needs to be completed.
When AllCommandPosts are captured, TheTeam with noCommandPosts has TwentySeconds to recapture or neutralize anEnemyCommandPost.
If TheTeam cannot take over aPost in ThisTime, TheMatch is over.
CertainCampaignLevels and Multiplayer have Requirements that differ from TheGeneralGamePlay, however TheGeneralStructure remains the same.
TheGame's"conquest"Mode is vaguely based on TheBattlefieldGameMode of TheSameName.

CanceledSequels ===
StarWars: Battlefront III ====
On September 29, 2006, ComputerAndVideoGames made anUnconfirmedClaim that FreeRadicalDesign was developing TheThirdGame in TheStarWars: BattlefrontSeries, titled StarWars: BattlefrontIii.
In June 2008, Kotaku allegedly received Information from aFormerLucasartsEmployee that the Star Wars:
BattlefrontIii was in TheCreationProcess.
On October 2,  ActivisionBlizzard filed aClassification with TheAustralianOffice of FilmAndLiteratureClassification listing StarWars: BattlefrontIii for TheNintendods with apgRating (E10+ Equivalent) for MildAnimatedViolence.
However, that same month, FreeRadicalDesign announced that FreeRadicalDesign lost TheRights to develop StarWars: BattlefrontIii; TheGame at ThatPoint had been in Development for TwoYears.
Several years later, FreeRadicalDesignCo-founderSteveEllis said BattlefrontIii was "pretty much done" in 2008, but that BattlefrontIii was effectively canned when Lucasarts could not commit to "spend big" on Marketing BattlefrontIii.
However, Gamespot quoted anUnnamedLucasartsEmployee involved with TheProject Who said FreeRadical could not devote SufficientResources to TheGame and regularly missed Deadlines.
aFormerFreeRadicalDesignEmployee said some of TheTechnology FreeRadical developed for TheGame, SpecificallyTheContiguousGameEnvironment from PlanetSurface into Space, "is dying with us".
During and after TheGame'sDevelopment, Screenshots, and GameplayFootage became accessible to ThePublic.
In December 2008, StarWarsCharacter renders bearing aBattlefrontIiiWatermark surfaced from aLaid-offFreeRadicalEmployee.
The following month, GameplayFootage was leaked from a November 2008 FreeRadical in-House showing of BattlefrontIiiFootage.
GameplayFootage was pulled from Ign after Lucasarts demanded Lucasarts removal.
On April 1, 2012, aUser on TheGameJournalistWebsite Betagames discovered StarWarsModels and Textures buried in ResidentEvil:
OperationRaccoonCity'sArchives; pcGamer'sTomSenior speculated that these could have been from BattlefrontIii.

However, TheGame has been canceled after TheStudio was unable to meet TheGame 2010 release deadline.
FirstAssault and Version Two ====
FirstAssault was to be aDownloadableMultiplayerShooter for XboxLiveArcade.
DigitalTrends speculated that StarWars: FirstAssault might help Lucasarts recover some of Lucasarts previous investment in BattlefrontIii and OtherProjects in TheFranchise.
Speaking to Kotaku anAnonymousInsider noted that TheGame was to be "step zero" towards aThirdBattlefrontGame.
When Footage of TheGame was leaked onto YoutubeTechSite Technobuffalo noted that TheGameplay very closely resembled that of TheCall of DutyFranchise.
Alongside FirstAssault, Lucasarts was also working on aSeparateGame titled "Version 2", which was, reportedly, aCodeName for Battlefront 3.

In 2018, ConceptArt surfaced of aCanceledBattlefrontiv, rather than attempting to fit within ThePreviousGamesAndFilms'Continuity, ConceptArt showed TheGame was meant to focus on anAlternateReality where Obi-wanKenobi and LukeSkywalker fell to TheDarkSide, instead of AnakinSkywalker.

Fan-made SequelGames === ====
Galaxy in Turmoil ===
On January 25, 2016, FrontwireStudios began anAttempt to produce anUnofficialBattlefrontInstallment called Galaxy in Turmoil.
TheFan made Game was in Production using UnrealEngine 4 and was based on TheCanceledStarWars: BattlefrontIii by FreeRadicalDesign.
Although EarlyVersions of TheGame contained Assets from  FreeRadicalDesign, Assets soon became "placeHolders" as TheFullGame planned to be released using Assets and Music made from TheGround up.
On June 4, 2016, Galaxy in Turmoil gained aDistributionDeal through Valve and was planned to be released for free on Steam which generated aFairAmount of Attention.
On June 22, 2016, Lucasfilm requested TheProduction of Galaxy in Turmoil in Turmoil be halted.
On July 31, 2016, FrontwireStudios announced TheCancellation of TheGame was due to The"possibility of Galaxy in Turmoil taking away Attention from ElectronicArts'sBattlefrontFranchise".
Proposals of Galaxy in Turmoil falling under ThePaywall of ElectronicArts, and Ideas of Lucasfilm giving FrontwireStudios aStarWarsLicense were both rejected due to anAgreement between ElectronicArts and Lucasfilm.
Although FrontwireStudios may have fallen within FairUseLaws, LegalConflict was avoided and TheProject was canceled.
There is aPlayableAlpha that contains Assets from FreeRadicalDesign that was released to ThePublic then removed early within Galaxy in Turmoil'sLifetime.
Galaxy in Turmoil is now planned to be redeveloped as aBrandNewCyberpunk-themedip without AnyStarWarsReferences, but still with BattlefrontIii-inspiredMechanics including space-to-Ground battles.
