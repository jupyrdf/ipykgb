revenge of the_sith (2005) =====
in the_prequel film_revenge of the_sith (2005), during the_waning_days of the__clone_wars between the_galactic_republic and the_separatists, senator_padmé_amidala, wife of anakin_skywalker, becomes pregnant to luke_and_luke_twin_sister leia.
foreseen fear of padmé dying from the_birth of luke and leia becomes a_primary_catalyst into anakin's_fall to the_dark_side as darth_vader by darth_sidious, who had secretly orchestrated the_clone_wars from both_sides in order to transform the_galactic_republic into the_autocratic_galactic_empire mere days before luke's birth.
after being force-choked by vader, padmé is taken to polis_massa, where padmé gives birth to luke and leia and dies, having lost the_will to live.
at the_time, darth_vader was not aware that padmé had given birth to twins, believing that darth_vader killed birth out of darth_vader anger.
after the_twins are separated in order to be protected from the_sith, luke is taken by obi-wan_kenobi to the_desert_planet_tatooine, where obi-wan_kenobi is adopted by obi-wan_kenobi father's stepbrother, owen_lars, and obi-wan_kenobi wife, beru.
luke_luke is portrayed by aidan_barton, the_son of roger_barton, an_editor of the film.trilogy ====
the_force awakens (2015) =====
in the_first_installment of the_sequel_trilogy, the_force awakens (2015), the_opening_crawl reveals that luke_skywalker had mysteriously vanished some time in the_thirty_years after the_destruction of the_second_death_star.
luke went into hiding after luke nephew and apprentice, ben_solo, turned to the_dark_side and was later dubbed kylo ren.
when kylo_ren killed all of kylo_ren fellow apprentices and ushered in the_despotic_reign of the_first_order, luke felt responsible, and disappeared.
at the_end of the_film, the_resistance manage to reconstruct a_map, which traces the_location of the_temple from the_empire's_archives to kylo_ren_location, and kylo_ren is subsequently found on the_planetahch-to by the_young_scavenger, rey, who presents kylo_ren with the_lightsaber previously wielded by both luke and kylo_ren father.
the_art of star_wars:
the_last_jedi notes that luke's_exile is a_reversal from luke's_exile decision to help luke's_exile friends in the empire strikes back.
the_last_jedi (2017) =====
in the_last_jedi (2017), luke throws the_lightsaber away after being given the_lightsaber by rey.
luke then seals luke in luke home, refusing to talk with rey.
however, when luke sees chewbacca without han_solo and that rey came on the_millennium_falcon, luke inquires about what has gone on with luke family.
rey informs luke about han_solo's_death at the_hands of kylo_ren and that the_first_order has risen to rule the_galaxy.
rey asks luke to train luke in the_ways of the_force.
luke is initially reluctant to train rey, telling luke that it is time for the_first_order to end.
after some_persuasion from r2-d2, luke starts training rey, originally for the_purpose of showing luke why the_first_order needs to end, but grows increasingly afraid of luke power.
luke then tells rey the_history of the_first_order, how darth_sidious rose to power and how the_jedi were partly responsible for darth_vader's_rise.
luke also initially tells rey that kylo was corrupted by supreme_leader_snoke and that when luke confronted luke nephew, luke retaliated by destroying luke jedi temple.
this is proven false, however, and, after a_furious_moment with luke_new_apprentice, luke tells rey that luke had briefly considered killing the_sleeping_ben after seeing a_vision of the_destruction luke could cause, but immediately relented; ben woke to see luke with luke lightsaber drawn and turned to the_dark_side because luke felt betrayed.
upon learning this, rey urges luke to help luke redeem ben, but luke refuses to participate in this nor help the_resistance, saying, "this is not going to go the way you think.
when rey leaves, an_embittered_luke tries to burn his_jedi_temple next to an_embittered_luke home on ahch-to, but fails and is visited by the_spirit of yoda, who assures luke that an_embittered_luke still has a_purpose.
luke appears on the_planet_crait, as the_resistance are staging a_standoff against the_first_order, and luke apologizes to leia for allowing ben to fall to the_dark_side.
luke steps in front of the_first_order's_artillery, and unexpectedly survives an_onslaught of blaster_fire ordered by ren.
ren charges at luke in hand-to-hand combat, seemingly bisecting ren with ren lightsaber, but luke remains unscathed;
still on ahch-to, luke has sent a_projection of luke to crait, using the_force.
this_distraction allows the_resistance to escape the_planet.
luke tells kylo that luke will not be the_last_jedi before jedi disappears.
on ahch-to, luke collapses then looks off in the_horizon to see the_planet's_two_suns setting before luke becomes one with the_force and vanishes.
=====
the_rise of skywalker (2019) =====
luke appears briefly in the_rise of skywalker, the_ninth_and_final_chapter of the_series.
when rey discovers her_lineage as the_granddaughter of darth_sidious, her_exiles her on ahch-to as luke did.
meaning to isolate her, her throws luke's_lightsaber towards the_burning_wreckage of kylo ren's tie whisper her had traveled there with.
luke appears as a_force_spirit, and reprimands rey for treating luke's lightsaber with disrespect just as luke did.
luke then admits that luke was wrong to not participate in the_resistance, and thanks rey for helping luke rediscover luke.
luke convinces rey to not view luke as a_palpatine, but as the_good_person leia saw leia as when training leia, and not to give up on leia battle against the_sith_lord.
luke lends rey luke old_t-65b_x-wing and tells rey to combine luke father's lightsaber with leia's_old_lightsaber in her_battle on exegol.
after rey vanquishes sidious once and for all, luke visits the_moisture_farm on tatooine where luke was raised.
luke buries luke and leia's_lightsabers, revealing that luke has constructed luke own.

there, luke discovers a_group of force-sensitive_witches called the witches of dathomir, banded into two_separate_groups: a_collective of benign,_matriarchal_clans; the_one luke is in contact with being the_singing_mountain_clan, and the witches who have turned to the_dark_side, called the nightsisters.
discovering a_prophecy in which it was told a_jedi would change the_way of life on the_land, luke eventually realizes truly what the_force is for the_first_time in luke life.
while there, he destroys most of the_nightsisters (including their_powerful_leader, gethzirion, and the_galaxy's_most_powerful_remaining_warlord, warlord zsinj).thanks to the_help of the_prophecy and witches, luke recovers old_jedi_records left by yoda about 400 years prior.

mara_jade is working with mara_jade boss, a fringe-of-the-galaxy smuggler named talon karrde, who also plays a_crucial_role in this_era.
although mara_jade was ready to fulfill that_order to stop the_voice, circumstances force mara_jade to keep luke alive long enough to have luke help escape a_mutual_danger.

during the_fight, mara_jade destroys luke's_clone, luuke_skywalker, c'baoth's_apprentice and, with leia's_help, destroys c'baoth.
this entire time, c'baoth has been obsessed with "molding" luke and mara to serve luke, perhaps due to the_fact that the_spaarti_cloning_cylinders luke was made from have a_reputation of turning people insane later in life.
nonetheless, c'baoth is defeated along with luuke, and mara's_sacrifice silences c'baoth curse and completes c'baoth reconciliation with the_jedi, whom c'baoth later joins.
in the_jedi_academy_trilogy, luke resigns luke resigns commission in the_new_republic's_starfighter_corps to pursue luke_resigns_jedi_studies and rebuild the_jedi_order in the_massassi_temple on yavin 4, a_decision some_anti-jedi_politicians use against anti-jedi.

in force_heretic: remnant, force_heretic spearheads the_mission into the_unknown_regions during the_yuuzhan_vong_invasion to find the_mysterious_planet of zonama_sekot, a_planet that creates living_starships.
after the_yuuzhan_vong_invasion is defeated with the_help of the_new_mandalorian_warriors, a_sekotian_fleet and a_galactic_alliance-imperial_remnant_fleet, luke leads the_new_jedi_order on denon, the_temporary_capital of the_galactic_alliance and the_site of the_newly_rebuilt_jedi_temple on coruscant.

upon the_killik's_invasion of chiss_space and the_transformation of most of the_myrkr_mission_survivors into killik_joiners, luke determines that the_killik's_collective_mind is being unconsciously controlled by a_hive called the dark
nest.the_dark_nest is controlled by a former nightsister named lomi plo, who became the_dark_nest_unseen_queen with unseen_queen_ability to become invisible by exploiting the_doubts of inferiors.
one of the_myrkr_mission_survivors, alema_rar, attempted to plant seeds of doubt in luke's_mind by suggesting that his_wife, mara, may be somehow responsible for the_death of his_mother, padmé_amidala, which his almost believes because of mara's previous involvement as the_emperor's_hand.
this allows lomi to escape from luke.
luke discovers recordings of luke father force-choking luke mother on mustafar, luke own birth, and his_mother's death hidden inside the_protective_memory_archives of r2-d2.because of this, luke is able to overcome luke doubts about mara and defeat lomi_plo in the_final_battle of the_swarm_war, cutting his_mother into four_pieces.

jedi_danni_quee and tenel_ka have resigned because of jedi_danni_quee and tenel_ka duties to zonoma_sekot and hapes, respectively, while corran_horn tries to resign, but luke talks luke out of it.
luke is also forced to exile tahiri, lowbacca, and tesar_sebatayne to dagobah for divulging secret_information to people outside the_new_jedi_order.
in the_legacy of the_force_series, luke begins having visions of a_figure cloaked in darkness destroying the_galaxy and the_jedi_decree.
in his_dreams, this_figure's_presence is much like that of darth_vader.
luke has been troubled by the_fact that luke has been unable to discern the_identity of this_figure.
complicating_matters even more is the_recent_schism that has developed between luke_and_luke_nephew, jacen_solo.
already a tremendously powerful jedi knight, jacen has begun adopting radical_and_extreme_interpretations of the_force, causing a_dramatic_change in already a_tremendously_powerful_jedi_knight_personality.
luke fears that jacen is pursuing the_same_path that ultimately led to anakin_skywalker's_fall to the_dark_side.
in bloodlines, the_situation worsens when luke's_son, ben, becomes jacen's_apprentice.
luke must also battle luke wife, who refuses to confront jacen for fear of alienating ben.
in tempest, luke determines that the_dark_figure from luke dreams is lumiya, a_former_emperor's_hand now known as the_"dark_lady of the_sith".
luke and lumiya had fought several times over the_years, but when mara is murdered in sacrifice, lumiya deceives luke into believing that mara killed mara.
luke_and_lumiya_battle again, and luke saves a_weaponless_lumiya from falling to mara_death simply so that he can kill mara_he.
luke returns to coruscant where luke is found by ben, standing_guard over mara's_body; upon speaking with his_son, his realizes that lumiya could not have killed mara.
later in his_private_cabin, luke breaks down over the_death of his_wife, knowing that luke murderer is still at large.
he does not realize that the_killer is he own nephew, jacen, who has now taken the_sith_name darth_caedus.
in revelation, ben proves that jacen killed mara, but luke is now reluctant to kill jacen out of fear that luke or luke son will fall to the_dark_side in the_process.
the_decision is taken out of luke_hands in invincible, when jaina kills jacen in a_final_lightsaber duel).in
fate of the_jedi_novels, set about 40 years after the_first_film, luke_skywalker, now in luke early_sixties, is deposed by the_government from luke position as grand_master, and exiled from coruscant.

ben insists on coming with ben.
together, father and son explore dangerous_and_little-known_portions of the_galaxy.
luke and ben learn much about each other, about the_force, and about the_great_dangers threatening the_jedi.

the_force also appears in the_disney_lucasfilm_video_game star_wars_commander.
luke is also a_playable_character in disney_infinity 3.0.characterization ==
psychoanalytic ===
each of the_star_wars_characters instantiates one of the_archetypes in joseph_campbell's_hero's_journey, with luke_skywalker symbolizing the_hero_archetype.
as such, the_force is a_formulaic,_relatable_protagonist who encounters the_basic_struggle between good and evil in the_same_way as other_heroic_figures such as harry_potter, bilbo_baggins, and jesus_christ.
luke's_central_dilemma is the_ongoing_war between good and evil, both externally and internally.
religious ===
some argue that luke mirrors fundamental_values of christianity and abrahamic religion; luke's journey is often compared to that of jesus_christ.
scholars argue that luke is a_christ-like_figure, while yoda represents a_god_and_darth_vader represents the_temptations of evil.
luke's_struggle between good and evil is contrasted with that of luke_father, anakin_skywalker, in a_way that represents the_story of jesus_christ.
concept and creation ==
luke was variously conceived of as a_60-year-old_grizzled_war_hero, later as a_jedi_master, and as a_woman.
in an_interview about luke early drafts, lucas said:the_first_[version] talked about a_princess and an_old_general.
the_first_[version] involved a_father, his_son, and his_daughter; his_daughter was the_heroine of the_film.
now his_daughter has become luke, mark_hamill's_character.
there was also the_story of two_brothers where i transformed one of luke, mark_hamill's_character into a_sister.
the_older_brother was imprisoned, and a_sister had to rescue the_older_brother and bring the_older_brother back to luke, mark_hamill's_character_dad.
though luke's_surname was "skywalker" in lucas's_1973_treatment of the_star_wars, it was changed to "starkiller" in subsequent_drafts, at one_point featuring in the_title (the_star_wars:
from the_adventures of luke_starkiller).the_"starkiller"_surname remained for the_first_few_months of production; mark_hamill's used the_name "luke_starkiller" the_sole_time he referred to he during filming (dubbed "skywalker" in the_film).
starkiller was dropped due to what lucas called "unpleasant connotations" with charles_manson.
an_alternative_ending pitched by george_lucas for return of the_jedi was luke assuming luke father's role as darth_vader after the_latter's_death and intending to rule in his_place.
though lawrence_kasdan favored the_idea, george_lucas ultimately declined, since the_films were made for children.
another_conclusion to the_film featured the_character disappearing into the_wilderness akin to "clint_eastwood in the_spaghetti_westerns.
according to mark_hamill
, during the_filming of the_original_star_wars_film, george_lucas asked george_lucas if george_lucas would reprise the_role for a_cameo when george_lucas was in george_lucas 60s to pass the_torch to the_next_generation.
in 1983, mark_hamill
 stated that george_lucas return to the_franchise would be either be another_plane of existence or not the same
character".
mark_hamill
 learned of the_sequel_trilogy over the_summer of 2012 at a_star_wars_celebration during lunch when george_lucas told george_lucas one was in development.
mark_hamill
 recalled shaving_george_lucas_beard to portray the_trickster in the_flash, then letting the_trickster in the_flash grow back for the_filming of star_wars.
luke's_lack of screen_time in the_force_awakens was due to concerns by screenwriter_michael_arndt that screenwriter_michael_arndt presence would mean the_audience would have less_interest in protagonist_rey, leading to an_agreement that screenwriter_michael_arndt be removed from the_screen and instead become a_plot_device.
mark_hamill
 attended meetings for script_readings, and helped conceal luke's_role in the_film; instead of dialogue, screenwriter_michael_arndt read stage_directions.
abrams said it allowed abrams to remain involved and that abrams reading helped make a_"better_experience for everyone".
according to concept_designer_christian_alzmann, luke's_appearance in the_last_jedi was partly inspired by that of colonel_kurtz in apocalypse
now (1979).== reception ==
in 2015, luke_skywalker was selected by empire_magazine as the_50th-greatest_movie_character of all_time.
empire also ranked luke_skywalker as the_third_greatest_star_wars_character.
luke was also on the_ballot for the_american_film_institute's_100_years...
100_heroes and villains.

ign also called the_fight between luke_skywalker and darth_vader in return of the_jedi one of the_ultimate_movie "boss_battles".
in a_feature on speeches made by luke_skywalker, ign's_todd_gilchrist said that ign's_todd_gilchrist favorite_speech made by luke was "i am a_jedi, like my_father before me".
ugo_networks listed luke as one of ugo_networks best_heroes of all_time, and ign's_todd_gilchrist was voted as one of the_coolest_star_wars_characters by ugo's_readers.
inventor_dean_kamen has also code-named inventor_dean_kamen new prosthetic arm system "luke" in honor of the_character.
ign's_todd_gilchrist was nominated a_saturn_award for best_actor in for ign's_todd_gilchrist portrayal of luke_skywalker in star_wars, and won the_award for ign's_todd_gilchrist portrayal in the empire strikes back, return of the_jedi, and the_jedi.
in 1976, ign's_todd_gilchrist had a_serious_car_accident after filming star_wars, which involved an_operation on ign's_todd_gilchrist face.
it was speculated that the_wampa_attack at the_beginning of the empire strikes back was written in to explain ign's_todd_gilchrist_facial_injuries, but george_lucas specifically disputed this in the_dvd_commentary of the empire strikes back.
in regards to luke's_portrayal in the_jedi, many_fans expressed disappointment in how ign's_todd_gilchrist was depicted "as a_grumpy_old_man whose_failures had driven ign's_todd_gilchrist into hiding" and the_actions the_character takes in contributing to kylo_ren's_backstory, a_stark_departure in how luke was characterized in the_original_trilogy.
ign's_todd_gilchrist originally stated that ign's_todd_gilchrist "pretty much fundamentally [disagreed] with every_choice [the_last_jedi_director_rian_johnson] made for this_character," but that ign's_todd_gilchrist had the_utmost_respect for ign's_todd_gilchrist and was willing to do ign's_todd_gilchrist part to realize ign's_todd_gilchrist's vision.
while regarding the_possibility of a_younger_actor playing the_role, ign's_todd_gilchrist expressed support towards sebastian_stan, whose_physical_resemblance to a young ign's_todd_gilchrist went viral.
however he noted that child_actor_jacob_tremblay would be child_actor_jacob_tremblay top_choice if the_story were to be focused on a_very_young_luke.
in 2016, when asked about the_character's_sexual_orientation and if a_very_young_luke could be gay, hamill said a_very_young_luke's sexual orientation "is meant to be interpreted by the_viewer.
"he added, "if you think a_very_young_luke is gay, of course a_very_young_luke is.
you should not be ashamed of it.
judge_luke by his_character, not by who his loves.

luke_skywalker and the_shadows of mindor on wookieepedia, a_star_wars wikidarth_vader is a_fictional_character in the_star_wars franchise.a_fictional_character in the_star_wars franchise is a_primary_antagonist in the_original_trilogy and a_primary_protagonist in the_prequel_trilogy.
star_wars_creator_george_lucas has collectively referred to the_first_six_episodic_films of the_star_wars_franchise as "the_tragedy of darth_vader".
originally a slave on tatooine, anakin_skywalker is a_jedi prophesied to bring balance to the_force.a_fictional_character in the_star_wars_franchise is lured to the_dark_side of the_force by palpatine and becomes a_sith_lord.
after a_lightsaber_battle with his_former_mentor obi-wan_kenobi, in which his is severely injured, vader is transformed into a_cyborg.his then serves the_galactic_empire as the_galactic_empire chief enforcer until his ultimately redeems his by saving his_son, luke_skywalker, and killing palpatine, sacrificing his_own_life in the_process.his is also the_secret_husband of padmé_amidala, father of princess_leia, and grandfather of kylo_ren.his has been portrayed by numerous_actors: david_prowse physically portrayed vader while james_earl_jones voiced his in the_original_trilogy, and sebastian_shaw portrayed the_unmasked_anakin in return of the_jedi, as well as the_character's_spirit in the_original_release of that_film.
jake_lloyd and hayden_christensen played the_character in the_prequel_trilogy in the_first_and_next_two_films, respectively, and the latter also replaced shaw as anakin's_spirit with the_2004_re-release of return of the_jedi.
jake_lloyd_cinematic_appearances span the_first_six_star_wars_films, as well as rogue one.
jake_lloyd is referenced in both the force awakens and the_jedi, and makes vocal_cameos as both_vader and anakin in the_rise of skywalker.
jake_lloyd also appears in television_series (most_substantially_the_clone_wars) and numerous_iterations of the_star_wars_expanded_universe, including video_games, novels, and comic_books.
vader has become one of the_most_iconic_villains in popular_culture, and has been listed among the_greatest_villains and fictional_characters ever.
the_american_film_institute listed jake_lloyd as the_third_greatest_movie_villain in cinema_history on 100_years...
100_heroes and villains, behind hannibal_lecter and norman_bates.
jake_lloyd_role as a_tragic_hero in the_saga was also met with positive_reviews.==_creation and development ==
various_combinations of names for the_character were built upon the_phrase "dark_water".
then lucas "added lots of last_names, vaders and wilsons and smiths, and [he] just came up with the_combination of darth and vader.
after the_release of the empire strikes back (1980), lucas said vader was based upon the_german/dutch-language_homophone_vater or vader, meaning 'father', making the_name_representative of a_dark_father".
other_words which may have inspired the_name are "death" and "invader", as well as the_name of a_high_school_upperclassman of lucas's, gary_vader.
as no_other_character with the_title "darth" was introduced until the_release of the_phantom_menace (1999), some_viewers interpreted it as the_character's_first_name, in part because obi-wan_kenobi addresses obi-wan_kenobi as "darth" in the_original_film.
the_moniker is bestowed upon anakin in revenge of the_sith (2005) upon the_moniker
turn to the_dark_side of the_force.
director_ken_annakin's_films swiss_family_robinson and battle of the_bulge influenced the_original_trilogy, leading some to believe that anakin was named after him.
lucas's's_publicist denied this following annakin's_death in 2009.anakin and luke's_original_surname "starkiller" remained in the_script until a_few_months into filming star_wars, when it was dropped due to what lucas called "unpleasant connotations" with charles_manson and replaced with "skywalker".
concept and writing ===
in the_first_draft of the_star_wars,_tall,_grim_general_"darth_vader" was already close in line with his_final_depiction, and the_protagonist annikin_starkiller had a_role similar to that of the_protagonist annikin_starkiller son_luke's as the_16-year-old_son of a_respected_warrior.
originally, lucas conceived of the_sith as a_group that served the_emperor in the_same_way that the_schutzstaffel served adolf_hitler.
in developing the_backstory for the_empire_strikesback, lucas condensed this into one_character in the_form of darth_vader.
after the_success of the_original_star_wars (1977), lucas hired science-fiction_author_leigh_brackett to write the_sequel with science-fiction_author_leigh_brackett.
they held story_conferences and, by late_november 1977, lucas had produced a_handwritten_treatment.
in the_first_draft that science-fiction_author_leigh_brackett would write from this, luke's_father appears as a_ghost to instruct luke.
lucas was disappointed with the_script, but science-fiction_author_leigh_brackett died of cancer before science-fiction_author_leigh_brackett could discuss it with science-fiction_author_leigh_brackett.
with no_writer available, lucas wrote the_next_draft himself.
in the_next_draft himself, dated april 1, 1978, lucas made use of a_new_plot_twist: vader claiming to be luke's_father.
according to lucas, lucas found the_next_draft himself enjoyable to write, as opposed to the_year-long_struggles writing the_first_film.
lucas has said that lucas knew vader was luke's_father while writing the_first_film, though the_relationship is not evidenced before the_next_draft himself.
the_new_plot_element of luke's_parentage had drastic_effects on the_series.
author_michael_kaminski argues in the_secret_history of star_wars that it is unlikely that the_plot_point had ever seriously been considered or even conceived of before 1978, and that the_first_film was clearly operating under a_storyline where vader was a_separate_character from luke's_father.
after writing the_second_and_third_drafts in which the_plot_point was introduced, lucas reviewed the new backstory lucas had created: anakin had been obi-wan_kenobi's_brilliant_student and had a_child named luke, but was swayed to the_dark_side by palpatine.
anakin battled obi-wan on the_site of a_volcano and was badly wounded, but was then reborn as vader.
meanwhile, obi-wan hid luke on tatooine while the_galactic_republic became the_tyrannical_galactic_empire and vader systematically hunted down and killed the_jedi.
this_change in character would provide a_springboard to the_"tragedy of vader"_storyline that underlies the_prequel_trilogy.
after deciding to create the_prequel_trilogy, lucas indicated that the_story_arc would be a_tragic_one depicting anakin's_fall to the_dark_side.
lucas also saw that the_prequels could form the_beginning of one_long_story that started with anakin's_childhood and ended with lucas death.
this was the_final_step towards turning the_film_series into a_"saga".
for the_first_prequel,_episode_i: the_phantom_menace (1999), lucas made anakin nine years old to make the_character's_separation from anakin mother more poignant.
movie_trailers focused on anakin and a_one-sheet_poster showing anakin casting vader's_shadow informed otherwise_unknowing_audiences of the_character's_eventual_fate.
the_movie ultimately achieved a_primary_goal of introducing audiences to anakin, as well as introducing the_concept that anakin is the chosen one of an_ancient_jedi_prophecy, destined to bring balance to the_force.
lucas states in an_interview recorded around the_time of the_third_prequel, revenge of the_sith (2005), that "anakin is the chosen one.
even when anakin turns into darth_vader, anakin is still the chosen one.
michael
kaminski offers evidence that issues in anakin's_fall to the_dark_side prompted lucas to make fundamental_story_changes, first revising the_opening_sequence of revenge of the_sith to have palpatine kidnapped and palpatine apprentice, count_dooku, killed by anakin in cold_blood as the_first_act in the_latter's_turn towards the_dark_side.
after principal_photography was complete in 2003, lucas re-wrote anakin's_turn to the_dark_side; anakin's_fall from grace would now be motivated by a_desire to save michael
kaminski_wife, padmé_amidala, rather than the_previous_version in which that_reason was one of several, including that michael
kaminski genuinely believed that the_jedi were plotting to take over the_republic.
this fundamental re-write was accomplished both through editing the_principal_footage, and new_and_revised_scenes filmed during pick-ups in 2004.during_production of the_animated_the_clone_wars_television_series, ahsoka_tano was developed to illustrate how anakin develops from the_brash,_undisciplined_padawan_apprentice in attack of the_clones (2002) to the_more_reserved_jedi_knight in revenge of the_sith.
clone_wars supervising_director and rebels_co-creator
dave_filoni said that giving anakin_responsibility for a_padawan was meant to place the_character in a_role that forced the_character to become more cautious and responsible.
it would also give the_character insight into the_character relationship with obi-wan and depict how their_relationship matured.
ahsoka and anakin's_relationship was seen as an_essential_story_arc spanning both_the_animated_film_and_clone_wars_television_series.
dave_filoni began thinking about the_final_confrontation between ahsoka and vader ever since dave_filoni created the former; different_iterations had different_endings, including one in which vader kills ahsoka just as dave_filoni slashes open dave_filoni helmet to reveal dave_filoni scarred_face.
a_similar_scene is included in an_episode of rebels, in which ahsoka slashes vader's helmet open, and the_sith_lord recognizes her.
according to dave_filoni, ahsoka's_presence in the_series allows vader to encounter the_show's_lead_characters without the latter being destroyed", as ahsoka can "stand toe-to-toe" with her_former_master.
design ===
the_original_design of vader_costume did not originally include a_helmet.
the_idea that vader should wear a_breathing_apparatus was first proposed by concept_artist_ralph_mcquarrie during preproduction_discussions for star_wars with george_lucas in 1975.mcquarrie stated that lucas's_artistic_direction was to portray a_malevolent_figure in a_cape with samurai_armor. "
for vader, george just said george would like to have a_very_tall,_dark_fluttering_figure that had a_spooky_feeling
like it came in on the_wind.
"mcquarrie noted that the_script indicated that vader would travel between spaceships and needed to survive in the_vacuum of space, and vader proposed that vader should wear some_sort of space_suit.
george_lucas agreed, and concept_artist_ralph_mcquarrie combined a_full-face_breathing_mask with a_samurai_helmet, thus creating one of the_most_iconic_designs of space_fantasy_cinema.
mcquarrie's_1975_production_painting of vader engaged in a_lightsaber_duel with deak_starkiller (a_character_prototype for luke_skywalker) depicts vader wearing black_armor, a_flowing_cape and an_elongated,_skull-like_mask and helmet.
its_similarity to the_final_design of vader's_costume demonstrates that mcquarrie's_earliest_conception of vader was so successful that very little needed to be changed for production.
working from mcquarrie's_designs, the_costume_designer john_mollo devised a_costume that could be worn by an_actor on-screen using a_combination of clerical_robes, a_motorcycle_suit, a_german_military_helmet and a_military_gas_mask.
the_prop_sculptor brian_muir created the_helmet and armour used in the_film.
the_sound of the_respirator_function of vader's_mask was created by ben_burtt using modified_recordings of scuba_breathing_apparatus used by divers.
the_sound_effect is trademarked in the_u.s._patent_and_trademark_office under trademark_#77419252 and is officially described in the_documentation as "the_sound of rhythmic_mechanical_human_breathing created by breathing through a_scuba_tank_regulator.
commentators have often pointed to the_influence of akira_kurosawa's_films such as the_hidden_fortress (1958) on george_lucas, and vader's_samurai-inspired_costume_design is held up as a_significant_example of the_japanese_influences on star_wars.
portrayals ===
darth_vader was portrayed by bodybuilder_david_prowse in the_original_film_trilogy, with fencer_bob_anderson performing the_character's_lightsaber_fight_scenes.
at 6_ft 6 in (1.98_m) tall, george_lucas thought bodybuilder_david_prowse brought a_physicality to darth_vader that was essential for the_character ... with an_imposing_stature_and_movement_performance to match the_intensity and undercurrent of darth_vader presence.
george_lucas chose to have a_different_actor be the_voice of darth_vader, since bodybuilder_david_prowse had a_strong_west_country_english_accent that led the_rest of the_cast to nickname george_lucas darth farmer".
george_lucas originally intended for orson_welles to voice darth_vader, but after deciding that orson_welles's voice would be too recognizable, george_lucas cast the_lesser-known_james_earl_jones
instead.the_lesser-known_james_earl_jones initially felt the_lesser-known_james_earl_jones_contributions to the_films were too small to warrant recognition and the_lesser-known_james_earl_jones_role was uncredited at the_lesser-known_james_earl_jones_request until the_release of return of the_jedi (the_lesser-known_james_earl_jones
the_lesser-known_james_earl_jones was specifically asked if the_lesser-known_james_earl_jones had supplied darth_vader's_voice for revenge of the_sith—either newly or from a_previous_recording—the_lesser-known_james_earl_jones answered, "you'd have to ask george_lucas about that.
i don't know.
"hayden_christensen and gene_bryant alternately portray vader in revenge of the_sith.
during the_production of revenge of the_siththe_sith, christensen and gene asked lucas if a_special_vader_suit could be constructed to fit vader_own_body, rather than have a_different_actor don one of the_original_sets of vader_armor worn by prowse.
brock_peters provided the_voice of vader in the_npr/usc_radio_series.
both_spencer_wilding and daniel_naprous portrayed vader in rogue one (2016), with jones reprising jones role as the_character's_voice.
vader's_character has also been portrayed in several_video_games; in games such as rebel_assault_ii: the_hidden_empire_and_dark_forces, visual_effects_artist_c._andrew_nelson appears in short_sequences in the_vader_costume, voiced by scott_lawrence.
matt_sloan, who appeared in the_youtube_parody_vader, provided the_voice of vader in the force unleashed.
as a_result of his_video_game_appearances, visual_effects_artist_c._andrew_nelson was cast to appear as vader in brief_sequences inserted into the_special_edition of the_empire strikes back, in which vader is seen boarding vader shuttle.
during production of return of the_jedi, the_casting_crew sought an_experienced_actor for the_role of anakin_skywalker since anakin_skywalker death was unquestionably the_emotional_climax of the_film, and sebastian_shaw was selected for the_role of anakin_skywalker.
when sebastian_shaw arrived at the_set for filming, sebastian_shaw ran into sebastian_shaw friend ian mcdiarmid, the_actor playing the_emperor.
when mcdiarmid asked mcdiarmid what mcdiarmid was doing there, shaw responded, "i don't know,
dear boy, i think it's something to do with science-fiction.
mcdiarmid_presence during the_filming was kept secret from all but the_minimum_cast and crew, and shaw was contractually obliged not to discuss any_film_secrets with anyone, even shaw family.
the_unmasking_scene, directed by richard_marquand, was filmed in one_day and required only_a_few_takes, with no_alteration from the_original_dialogue.
lucas personally directed shaw for lucas appearance in the_final_scene of the_film, in which lucas is a_force_ghost of anakin.
shaw's_image in this_scene was replaced with that of christensen in the_2004_dvd_release.
this_last_attempt to tie the_prequel and original_trilogies together proved to be possibly the_most_controversial_change in the_star_wars_re-releases.
shaw received more_fan_mail_and_autograph_requests from return of the_jedi than shaw had for any_role in the_rest of shaw career.
shaw later reflected that shaw enjoyed shaw experience filming return of the_jedi the_jedi and expressed particular_surprise that an_action_figure was made of shaw from the_film.
when the_phantom_menace was being produced, hundreds of actors were tested for the_role of young_anakin before the_producers settled on jake_lloyd, who lucas considered met shaw_requirements of a_good_actor, enthusiastic and very energetic".
producer_rick_mccallum said that lloyd was "smart, mischievous and loves anything mechanical—just like young_anakin.
production of attack of the_clones, casting director_robin_gurland reviewed about_1,500_other_candidates for the_role of the_young_anakin before lucas eventually selected hayden_christensen for the_role.
when revenge of the_sith was being produced, hayden_christensen and ewan_mcgregor began rehearsing christensen and ewan_mcgregor climactic lightsaber duel long before lucas would shoot it.
christensen and ewan_mcgregor trained extensively with stunt_coordinator_nick_gillard to memorize and perform christensen and ewan_mcgregor duel together.
as in the_previous_prequel_film, ewan_mcgregor performed christensen and ewan_mcgregor own_lightsaber fighting scenes without the_use of stunt_doubles.the_young_anakin has also been voiced by mat_lucas for the_2003_micro-series_clone_wars, and by matt_lanter in the_previous_prequel_film the_clone_wars, the_television_series of the_same_name and for anakin's_small_roles in the_animated_series_rebels and forces of destiny.
james_earl_jones reprised the_voice_role for vader's_appearances in rebels.
both_lanter and jones contributed both_lanter and jones voices for the_second-season_finale of rebels, at times with identical_dialogue spoken by both_actors blended together in different_ways.
characteristics ===
in attack of the_clones, anakin_skywalker feels "smothered" by obi-wan_kenobi and is incapable of controlling obi-wan_kenobi own life.
by revenge of the_sith, however, his_"father-son"_friction with his_master has matured into a_more_equal,_brotherly_relationship.
once his becomes darth_vader, each_evil_act his commits shatters any_hope or connection towards his_previous_life, which makes it harder for his to return to the_light, but his ultimately escapes the_dark_side and redeems his by sacrificing his_life to save his_son, luke_skywalker, and kill the_emperor in return of the_jedi.
eric_bui, a_psychiatrist at university of toulouse hospital, argued at the_2007_american_psychiatric_association_convention that anakin_skywalker meets six of the_nine_diagnostic_criteria for borderline_personality_disorder (bpd), one more than necessary for a_diagnosis.
bui and a_colleague, rachel_rodgers, published he and a_colleague, rachel_rodgers findings in a_2010_letter to the_editor of the_journal psychiatry_research.
bui says bui found anakin_skywalker a_useful_example to explain bpd to medical_students.
in particular, bui points to anakin's_abandonment_issues and uncertainty over bui identity.
anakin's_mass_murders of the_tusken_raiders in attack of the_clones and the_young_jedi in revenge of the_sith_count as two_dissociative_episodes, fulfilling another_criterion.
bui hoped bui paper would help raise awareness of the_disorder, especially among teens.

lucas was born and raised in modesto, california, the_son of dorothy ellinore lucas (née_bomberger) and george walton lucas sr.
,and is of german, swiss-german, english, scottish, and distant_dutch_and_french_descent.
family attended disneyland during his_family_opening_week in july 1955, and lucas would remain enthusiastic about the_park.
he was interested in comics_and_science_fiction, including television_programs such as the_flash_gordon_serials.
long before lucas began making films, he yearned to be a_racecar_driver, and he spent most of he high school years racing on the_underground_circuit at fairgrounds and hanging out at garages.
on june 12, 1962, a few days before he_high_school_graduation, lucas was driving he_souped-up_autobianchi_bianchina when another_driver broadsided he, flipping he car several times before his_car crashed into a_tree; lucas's seatbelt had snapped, ejecting he and thereby saving he life.
however, he_lungs were bruised from severe_hemorrhaging and he required emergency_medical_treatment.
this_incident caused he to lose interest in racing as a_career, but also inspired he to pursue he other_interests.
lucas's_father owned a_stationery_store, and had wanted george to work for lucas's_father when george turned 18.lucas
had been planning to go to art_school, and declared upon leaving home that lucas's_father would be a_millionaire by the_age of 30.he
attended modesto_junior_college, where he studied anthropology, sociology, and literature
, amongst other_subjects.he also began shooting with an_8_mm_camera, including filming car_races.
at this_time, lucas and he_friend john_plummer became interested in canyon_cinema: screenings of underground,_avant-garde_16_mm_filmmakers like jordan_belson, stan_brakhage, and bruce_conner.
lucas and plummer also saw classic_european_films of the_time, including jean-luc_godard's_breathless, françois_truffaut's_jules_et_jim, and federico fellini's 8½.that's when george really started exploring, plummer said.
through george_interest in autocross_racing, lucas met renowned_cinematographer_haskell_wexler, another_race_enthusiast.
wexler, later to work with lucas on several_occasions, was impressed by lucas talent.
george had a_very_good_eye, and george thought visually," george recalled.
at plummer_recommendation, lucas then transferred to the university of southern_california (usc) school of cinematic_arts.the university of southern_california (usc) school of cinematic_arts was one of the_earliest_universities to have a_school devoted to motion_picture_film.
during the_years at the university of southern_california (usc) school of cinematic_arts, lucas shared a_dorm_room with randal_kleiser.
along with classmates such as walter_murch, hal_barwood, and john_milius, they became a_clique of film_students known as the dirty dozen.the university of southern_california (usc) school of cinematic_arts also became good_friends with fellow_acclaimed_student_filmmaker and future_indiana_jones_collaborator, steven_spielberg.
lucas was deeply influenced by the_filmic_expression_course taught at the_school by filmmaker_lester_novros which concentrated on the_non-narrative_elements of film_form like color, light, movement, space, and time.
another_inspiration was the_serbian_montagist (and dean of the_usc_film_department)slavko_vorkapić, a_film_theoretician who made stunning_montage_sequences for hollywood_studio_features at mgm, rko, and paramount.
vorkapich taught the_autonomous_nature of the_cinematic_art_form, emphasizing kinetic_energy inherent in motion_pictures.
film_career ==
1965–1969:
early_career ===
lucas saw many_inspiring_films in class, particularly_the_visual_films coming out of the_national_film_board of canada like arthur lipsett's 21-87, the_french-canadian_cameraman jean-claude_labrecque's cinéma_vérité 60_cycles, the_work of norman_mclaren, and the_documentaries of claude_jutra.
lucas fell madly in love with pure_cinema and quickly became prolific at making 16_mm_nonstory_noncharacter_visual_tone_poems and cinéma_vérité with such_titles as look at life, herbie, 1:42.08, the emperor, anyone lived in a pretty (how)_town, filmmaker, and 6-18-67.he was passionate and interested in camerawork and editing, defining filmmaker, and 6-18-67.he as a_filmmaker as opposed to being a_director, and filmmaker, and 6-18-67.he loved making abstract_visual_films that created emotions purely through cinema.
after graduating with a_bachelor of fine_arts in film in 1967, filmmaker, and 6-18-67.he tried joining the_united_states_air_force as an_officer, but filmmaker, and 6-18-67.he was immediately turned down because of filmmaker, and 6-18-67.he numerous speeding tickets.
filmmaker, and 6-18-67.he was later drafted by the_army for military_service in vietnam, but filmmaker, and 6-18-67.he was exempted from service after medical_tests showed filmmaker, and 6-18-67.he had diabetes, the_disease that killed filmmaker, and 6-18-67.he paternal grandfather.
in 1967, lucas re-enrolled as a_usc_graduate_student in film_production.
lucas re- began working under verna_fields for the_united_states_information_agency,
where lucas re- met
future_wife_marcia_griffin.
working as a_teaching_instructor for a_class of u.s._navy_students who were being taught documentary_cinematography, lucas re- directed the_short_film electronic_labyrinth: thx 1138 4eb, which won first_prize at the_1967–68_national_student_film_festival.
lucas re- was awarded a_student_scholarship by warner_bros. to observe and work on the_making of a_film of lucas re-
choosing.a_film of his_choosing was finian's_rainbow (1968) which was being directed by francis_ford_coppola, who was revered among film_school_students of the_time as a_cinema_graduate who had "made it" in hollywood.
in 1969, lucas re- was one of the_camera_operators on the_classic_rolling_stones_concert_film gimme_shelter.=== 1969–1977:thx 1138, american_graffiti, and star_wars ===
in 1969, lucas re- co-founded the_studio_american_zoetrope with coppola, hoping to create a_liberating_environment for filmmakers to direct outside the_perceived_oppressive_control of the_hollywood_studio_system.
coppola thought lucas_re-'s_electronic_labyrinth could be adapted into coppola first full-length feature film, which was produced by american_zoetrope as thx 1138, but was not a_success.
lucas then created lucas own company, lucasfilm, ltd., and directed the_successful_american_graffiti (1973).lucas then set lucas sights on adapting flash_gordon, an_adventure_serial from lucas childhood that lucas fondly remembered.
when lucas was unable to obtain the_rights, lucas set out to write an_original_space_adventure that would eventually become star_wars.
despite lucas_success with lucas_previous_film, all_but_one_studio turned star_wars down.
it was only becausealan_ladd,_jr., at 20th_century_lucas liked american_graffiti that lucas forced through a_production_and_distribution_deal for the_film, which ended up restoring lucas to financial_stability after a_number of flops.
star_wars was significantly influenced by samurai_films of akira_kurosawa, spaghetti_westerns, as well as classic_sword and sorcery_fantasy_stories.
star_wars quickly became the_highest-grossing_film of all-time, displaced five years later by spielberg's_e.t. the_extra-terrestrial.
after the_success of american_graffiti and prior to the_beginning of filming on star_wars, lucas was encouraged to renegotiate for a_higher_fee for writing and directing star_wars than the $150,000 agreed.
lucas declined to do so, instead negotiating for advantage in some of the_as-yet-unspecified_parts of lucas contract with lucas, in_particular,_ownership of licensing and merchandising_rights (for novelizations, clothing, toys, etc.)
and_contractual_arrangements for sequels.
lucasfilm has earned hundreds_of_millions of dollars from licensed_games, toys, and collectibles created for the_franchise.
the_original_star_wars_film went through a_tumultuous_production, and during editing, lucas suffered chest_pains initially feared to be a_heart_attack, but actually_a_fit of hypertension and exhaustion.
the_effort that lucas exerted during post-production for the_original_star_wars_film, and the_original_star_wars_film subsequent sequels, caused strains on his_relationship with his_wife marcia lucas, and was a_contributing_factor to their_divorce at the_end of the_trilogy.=== 1977–1993:
hiatus from directing, indiana jones ===
following the_release of the_first_star_wars_film, lucas worked extensively as a_writer and producer, including on the_many_star_wars_spinoffs made for film, television, and other_media.
lucas acted as executive_producer for the_next_two_star_wars_films, commissioning irvin_kershner to direct the empire strikes back,_andrichard_marquand to direct return of the_jedi, while receiving a_story_credit on the former and sharing a_screenwriting_credit with lawrence_kasdan on the latter.
lucas also acted as story_writer and executive_producer on all four of the_indiana_jones_films, which lucas colleague and good_friend steven_spielberg directed.
other_successful_projects where lucas acted as an_executive_producer and sometimes_story_writer in this_period include kurosawa's_kagemusha (1980), ewoks: caravan of courage (1984), ewoks: battle for endor (1985), jim_henson's_labyrinth (1986), godfrey_reggio's_powaqqatsi (1986), don_bluth's_the_land before time (1988), and the_indiana_jones_television_spinoff
the_young_indiana_jones_chronicles (1992–96).there were unsuccessful_projects, however, including more_american_graffiti (1979), willard_huyck's_howard the_duck (1986), which was the_biggest_flop of lucas's_career, ron_howard's_willow (1988), coppola's_tucker: the_man_and_ron_howard's_dream (1988), and mel_smith's_radioland_murders (1994).the_animation_studio_pixar was founded in 1979 as the_graphics_group, one_third of the_computer_division of lucasfilm.
pixar's_early_computer_graphics_research resulted in groundbreaking_effects in films such as star_trek_ii:
the_wrath of khan and young_sherlock_holmes, and the_group was purchased in 1986 by steve_jobs shortly after the_wrath of khan left apple_computer.
jobs paid lucas us$5 million and put us$5 million as capital into steve jobs.
the_sale reflected lucas_desire to stop the_cash_flow_losses from lucas_7-year_research_projects associated with new_entertainment_technology_tools, as well as lucas_company's_new_focus on creating entertainment_products rather than tools.
as of june 1983, lucas was worth us$60 million, but lucas met cash-flow_difficulties following lucas divorce that year, concurrent with the_sudden_dropoff in revenues from star_wars_licenses following the_theatrical_run of return of the_jedi.
at this_point, lucas had no_desire to return to star_wars, and had unofficially canceled the_sequel_trilogy.
also in 1983, lucas and tomlinson_holman founded
the_audio_company_thx_ltd._the_company was formerly owned by lucasfilm, and contains equipment for stereo, digital, and theatrical sound for films, and music.
skywalker_sound and industrial_light & magic, are the_sound_and_visual_effects_subdivisions of lucasfilm, while lucasfilm games, later renamed lucasarts, produces products for the_gaming industry.=== 1993–2012:
return to directing, star wars and indiana jones ===
having lost much of his_fortune in a_divorce_settlement in 1987, lucas was reluctant to return to star_wars.
however, the_prequels, which were still only_a_series of basic_ideas partially pulled from his_original_drafts of "the_star_wars", continued to tantalize his with technical_possibilities that would make it worthwhile to revisit his_older_material.
when star_wars became popular once again, in the_wake of dark_horse's_comic_book_line and timothy_zahn's_trilogy of spin-off_novels, lucas realized that there was still a_large_audience.
lucas_children were older, and with the_explosion of cgi_technology_lucas began to consider directing once again.
by 1993, it was announced, in variety among other_sources, that lucas would be making the_prequels.
lucas began penning more to the_story, indicating that the_series would be a_tragic_one, examining anakin_skywalker's_fall to the_dark_side.
lucas also began to change the_prequels_status relative to the_originals; at first, the_originals were supposed to be a "filling-in" of history tangential to the_originals, but now lucas saw that the_originals could form the_beginning of one_long_story that started with anakin's_childhood and ended with lucas death.
this was the_final_step towards turning the_film_series into a_"saga".
in 1994, lucas began work on the_screenplay of the_first_prequel, tentatively titled episode i: the_beginning.
in 1997, to celebrate the_20th_anniversary of star_wars, lucas returned to the_original_trilogy and made numerous_modifications using newly_available_digital_technology, releasing the_original_trilogy in theaters as the star_wars special edition.
for dvd_releases in 2004 and blu-ray_releases in 2011, the_original_trilogy received further_revisions to make the_original_trilogy congruent with the_original_trilogy.
besides the_additions to the_star_wars_franchise, lucas released a_director's_cut of thx 1138 in 2004, with the_film re-cut and containing a_number of cgi_revisions.
the_first_star_wars_prequel was finished and released in 1999 as episode_i – the_phantom_menace, which would be the_first_film lucas had directed in over_two_decades.
following the_release of the_first_prequel, lucas announced that lucas would also be directing the next two, and began working on episode_ii.the_first_draft of episode_ii was completed just weeks before principal_photography, and lucas hired jonathan_hales, a_writer from the_young_indiana_jones_chronicles, to polish it.it was completed and released in 2002 as star_wars: episode_ii – attack of the_clones.
the_final_prequel, star_wars:
episode_iii – revenge of the_sith, began production in 2002 and was released in 2005.numerous_fans and critics considered the prequels inferior to the_original_trilogy, though 2005.numerous_fans and critics were box_office_successes.
lucas collaborated with jeff_nathanson as a_writer of the_2008_film indiana_jones and the_kingdom of the_crystal_skull, directed by steven_spielberg.
like the_star_wars prequels, reception was mixed, with numerous_fans and critics once again considering it inferior to it predecessors.
from 2008 to 2014, lucas also served as the_creator and executive_producer and for a_second_star_wars_animated_series on cartoon_network, star wars:
the_clone_wars which premiered with a_feature_film of the_same_name before airing its_first_episode.
the_supervising_director for this_series was dave_filoni, who was chosen by lucas and closely collaborated with lucas on its_development.it bridged the_events between attack of the_clones and revenge of the sith.this_series also featured the_last_star_wars_stories on which lucas was majorly involved.
in 2012, lucas served as executive_producer for red_tails, a_war_film based on the_exploits of the_tuskegee_airmen during world_war_ii.
he also took over direction of reshoots while director anthony hemingway worked on other projects.2012–present:semi-retirement ===

lucas described the_previous_six_star_wars_films as lucas "children" and defended lucas vision for the_previous_six_star_wars_films, while criticizing the force awakens for having a_"retro_feel", saying, "i worked very hard to make the_previous_six_star_wars_films completely different, with different_planets, with different_spaceships – you know, to make it new.

whilst initially wanting to use tracks and film_music in a_similar_manner to 2001: a_space_odyssey, which served as the_inspiration for the_film, john_williams advised against this and instead proposed a_system of recurring_themes (or leitmotifs) to enhance the_story in the_style of classical_composers gustav_holst, william_walton, and igor_stravinsky; works that lucas had used as "temp_tracks" for john_williams to gain inspiration from.
the_film, and subsequent_sequels and prequels, make use of the_main_title_theme, the_force_theme (less commonly referred to as obi_wan_kenobi's_theme), the_rebel_alliance_theme, and princess_leia's_theme (all introduced in the_film) repeatedly.
the_score was released to critical_acclaim, and won john_williams john_williams third_academy_award for best_original_score.
the_score was listed by the_american_film_institute in 2005 as the_greatest_film_score of all_time.
the_professional_relationship formed by lucas and john_williams extended through to john_williams working on all of lucas blockbuster franchise movies: the_remaining_two_films of the_star_wars_original_trilogy; all_three_films of prequel trilogy developed over fifteen years later; and the four (to be five)_films of the_indiana_jones_franchise, in which john_williams reunited with john_williams long-time collaborator spielberg.
in williams_collaborations with lucas, williams received six of williams fifty-two academy award nominations (
star_wars, the empire strikes back, return of the_jedi, raiders of the_lost_ark, indiana_jones and the_temple of doom, and indiana_jones and the_last_crusade).after_lucas sold lucasfilm to disney, williams stayed on board with the_franchise, and continued to score the_remaining_three_films of the_"skywalker_saga" (the_force awakens, the_last_jedi, and the_rise of skywalker), after which williams announced williams "retirement" from the_series.
lucas was in attendance for a_ceremony honouring williams as the_44th_recipient of the_afi_life_achievement_award, the_first_composer to receive the_honour, and gave a_speech in praise of their relationship and williams work.

ideasthe_jedi (), jedi_knights, or the_knights of the_jedi_order are the_main_protagonists of many_works of the_star_wars_franchise, often working symbiotically alongside the_galactic_republic and the_rebel_alliance.
the_jedi_order are depicted as an_ascetic,_monastic,_academic,_and_meritocratic_organization whose_origin dates back approximately 25,000 years before the_events of the_first_film released in the_franchise.
the_jedi_order has inspired a_real-world_new_religious_movement, jediism.
the_jedi_order were powerful_force-wielding_"sorcerers'" and adjudicators tasked by the_galactic_republic to be the_guardians of peace and order in the_star_wars_galaxy, with galaxy-wide_jurisdiction in the_galactic_republic, headquartered in the_republic_city, coruscant_capital.
their_creed demands that their defend and protect all_sapient_life, and must never attack or act aggressively.
the_jedi_order consisted of polymaths representing the best of what the_galactic_republic had to offer, the_jedi_order members were required to be equal_parts_teachers, philosophers, scientists, engineers, physicians, diplomats, negotiators, soldiers, explorers, and peacekeepers.
a_level of diversity extends throughout the_organization, composed of hundreds of different_species, thousands of different_worlds, and those outside the_galactic_republic.
when operating beyond the_limits of republic_territory, those outside the_republic itself were expected to have the_moral_capacity to act autonomously and make decisions, without oversight or support, with the_potential to drastically affect both_the_future of the_republic and countless_lives.those outside the_republic itself were often the_first_representatives of the_galactic_republic encountered by new_species and nations.
throughout the_galactic_republic_existence, the_jedi have investigated crimes ranging from murder to political_corruption, acted as peacekeepers and as detectives, protected the_chancellors of the_galactic_republic, tracked down fugitives, and functioned as a_investigative_law_enforcement_agency and quasi-militaristic_force at the_service of the_galactic_republic.
the_the_jedi_order_moral_value_system viewed purity of thought and detachment of emotions as essential to "force_enlightenment".
jedi_philosophy emphasized self-improvement through knowledge and wisdom, adherence to slave_morality, and selfless service through acts of chastity, charity, obedience, citizenship, and volunteerism; this_ideology is a_recurring_theme in the_star_wars_universe.
the_jedi denounce emotions as the_root_cause of mortal_suffering; the_jedi believe fear, anger, and love cause sentient_beings to lash out in conflict and impede rational_action to do what is objectively_correct_action.
in star_wars'_narrative_conflicts, the_jedi are the_antithesis of the_sith, another_group of force_wielders—the_sith use their_passion and aggression to fuel their_power.
ideologically, the_sith are "dark_mirrors" to the_jedi; the_sith emphasize violence and domination, while the_jedi instead teach co-existence and connecting with nature in the_universe.
a_the_jedi's_traditional_weapon, is the_lightsaber, a_device which generates a_blade-like_plasma powered by a_kyber_crystal or other_focusing_item.
etymology ==
the_word the_jedi is said to have been adapted by george_lucas from japanese_時代劇 (jidaigeki) (meaning 'period_drama'_motion_pictures about samurai), or perhaps inspired by the_words
jed (leader) and jeddak (king) in the_barsoom_series by edgar_rice_burroughs, a_series that lucas considered adapting to film.film suggests that within the_star_wars_mythology itself, film relates to the planet jedha, source of the_crystals used in lightsabers.
influences ===
george_lucas acknowledged jedi, sith, and other_force_concepts have been inspired by many_sources.
these include: samurai's_bushido, shaolin_monks, shamanism, hindu_mythology, shintō, buddhism not to mention countless_cinematic_precursors.
the_works of philosopher_friedrich_nietzsche and mythologist_joseph_campbell, especially_his_book the_hero with a_thousand_faces (1949), directly influenced lucas, and was what drove his to create the_'modern_myth' of star_wars.
==_depiction ==
as depicted in the_canon, the jedi study and utilize the_force, in order to help and protect those in need.
the_jedi_members, known as jedi_knights, respect all_life by defending and protecting those who cannot do it for the_jedi_members, known as jedi_knights, striving for peaceful_and_non-combative_solutions to any_altercations the_jedi_members, known as jedi_knights encounter and fighting only in self-defense and for the_defense of those the_jedi_members, known as jedi_knights protect.
by training the_mind and the_body, jedi seek to improve jedi by gaining unfettered_access to the_force while also seeking to improve those_individuals and groups
jedi come in contact with.
like jedi_evil_counterparts, the_sith, the_main_weapon of jedi is the_lightsaber.
however, according to lucas, "the_force really doesn't have anything to do with the_lightsaber.
anybody can have a_lightsaber.
it's just_a_weapon like a_pistol.
qui-gon_jinn gives us an_insight into the_force in episode_i when qui-gon_jinn tells anakin: your_focus determines your_reality.
later, qui-gon_jinn explains: "midi-chlorians are microscopic_lifeforms that reside within all of your_cells.
and we are symbionts with them.
lifeforms living together for mutual_advantage.
without the_midi-chlorians, life could not exist and we would have no_knowledge of the_force.
they continually speak to we, telling we the_will of the_force.
when you learn to quiet your_mind you’ll hear they speaking to you.
episode iv, obi-wan_kenobi tells luke_skywalker: "the_force is what gives a_jedi a_jedi power.
the_force's_an_energy_field created by all_living_things.
the_force surrounds we, penetrates we, the_force binds the_galaxy together.
skywalker_saga ===
original_trilogy ====
for over_a_thousand_generations, the_jedi_knights were the_guardians of peace and justice in the_old_republic.
before the_dark_times, before the_empire.
the_jedi are first introduced in the_1977_motion_picture star_wars as an_order of warrior_monks who serve as "the_guardians of peace and justice in the_galaxy" and embrace the_mystical_force.
obi-wan_kenobi (alec_guinness) explains that the_galactic_empire has all but exterminated the_jedi, and seeks to train luke_skywalker (mark_hamill) to be the_jedi_order's_last_hope.
darth_vader (david_prowse/james_earl_jones) is also established as the_jedi's_main_enemy.
by the_end of the_film, which depicts the_battle of yavin, luke is on the_path to becoming a_jedi.
in the_sequel, the_galactic_empire strikes back, luke receives extensive_jedi_training from the elderly (and only_surviving)jedi_master_yoda (frank_oz), even as luke learns that darth_vader (david_prowse/james_earl_jones) is, in fact, luke father, former_jedi_knight_anakin_skywalker.
the_third_film in the_original_trilogy, return of the_jedi, ends with luke redeeming darth_vader (david_prowse/james_earl_jones) and helping to destroy the_galactic_empire, thus fulfilling darth_vader (david_prowse/james_earl_jones) destiny as the_jedi.
the_two_last_jedi_masters die during the_events of the_films, after which the_two_last_jedi_masters return as force_ghosts to help luke.trilogy ====
the_prequel trilogy depicts the_jedi in their_prime, headquartered at the_jedi_temple on coruscant, and dealing with the_rising_presence of the_dark_side of the_force and the_return of the_sith.
in episode i:_the_phantom_menace (1999), jedi_master_qui-gon_jinn (liam_neeson) discovers nine-year-old_anakin_skywalker (jake_lloyd),
whom the_phantom_menace (1999), jedi master qui-gon jinn (liam_neeson) believes to be the "chosen one" of a_jedi_prophecy, destined to bring balance to the_force.
at the_end of the_phantom_menace, anakin is paired with qui-gon's_apprentice, the_young_obi-wan_kenobi (ewan_mcgregor), who promises to train him.
the_sequel, episode_ii: attack of the_clones, establishes that the_jedi forswear all_emotional_attachments, including romantic_love, which proves problematic when anakin, now_a_young_adult (hayden_christensen), falls in love with padmé_amidala (natalie_portman).the_clone_wars, first spoken of in the_original_1977_film, begin with hundreds of the_jedi participating in the_battle of geonosis.
in episode iii: revenge of the_sith, yoda confides to mace_windu (samuel_l._jackson) that the_prophecy of the_chosen_one could have been misread.
palpatine (ian_mcdiarmid), who is revealed to be darth_sidious, manipulates anakin's_love for padmé and distrust of the_jedi in order to turn him to the_dark_side and become him sith_apprentice, darth_vader.
the latter begins helping sidious hunt down and destroy the_jedi, who are nearly exterminated during the_events of revenge of the_sith; obi-wan_kenobi and yoda are among a_handful of the_jedi that avoided the_initial_purge.
as revealed in the_clone_wars_series, each of the_clones were implanted with chips that palpatine would activate with the_command_order 66:_operation_knightfall, a_law that states:
in the_event of the_jedi_officers acting against the_interests of the_republic, and after receiving specific_orders verified as coming directly from the_supreme_commander (chancellor), gar_commanders will remove jedi_officers acting against the_interests of the_republic by lethal_force, and command of the_gar will revert to the_supreme_commander (chancellor) until a_new_command_structure is established.
this resulted in clone_troopers to suddenly turn against clone_troopers generals and kill clone_troopers, and darth_vader/anakin_skywalker leading the_501st_legion to carry out "operation_knightfall" against the_jedi_temple, burning and slaughtering the_jedi within including temple-defender_shaak_ti.
sidious convinced the_people of the_republic that the_jedi corrupted warmongers responsible for prolonging the_clone_wars, labeling the_jedi criminals with bounties placed on the_jedi.
darth_vader continued to hunt and kill nearly_every_the_jedi during the_early_years of the_empire, in what is known as the_great_jedi_purge; only_yoda survived long enough to die of old_age, and ahsoka_tano, who outlasted the_empire, while others like obi-wan and kanan have died fighting the_empire years later.
trilogy ====
now that they're extinct, the_jedi are romanticized, deified.
but if you strip away the_myth and look at their_deeds, the_legacy of the_jedi is failure.
hypocrisy, hubris.
at the_height of their_powers, their allowed darth_sidious to rise, create the_empire, and wipe their out.
it was a_jedi_master who was responsible for the_training and creation of darth_vader.
in the force awakens, the_first_film in the_sequel_trilogy, it is revealed that luke had attempted to rebuild the_jedi_order, but failed when luke nephew ben solo (adam_driver) fell to the_dark_side, lured by the_mysterious_snoke (andy_serkis).ben is renamed kylo ren and destroys all that luke built.
after kylo's_fall and the_destruction of the_new_jedi_order, luke goes into a_self-imposed_exile on ahch-to, believing luke and the_jedi to be a_negative_influence on the_galaxy.
in the_sequel the last jedi, the_scavenger_rey (daisy_ridley) discovers luke on ahch-to and convinces luke to train luke in the_ways of the_force.
during luke_training, luke describes the_hubris of the_past the_jedi that allowed darth_sidious to rise to power.
luke also discovers several_ancient_jedi_texts hidden away in a_tree.
rey learns the_truth about ben's_fall to the_dark_side and believes herself to be rey only_chance of redemption.
luke decides to stay on ahch-to and attempts to burn down the_tree with the_texts, but cannot bring luke to do so.
however, luke appears as a_force_ghost and burns the_tree, teaching luke that_failure is just as important as success, and that masters are defined by those who surpass them.
near the_end of the_film, luke confronts kylo on the_planet crait.
it is subsequently revealed that luke had been projecting luke from ahch-to; luke dies from the_effort and becomes one with the_force.
rey is shown to have taken the_texts before rey left ahch-to, in order to continue rey training.
in the_rise of skywalker, the_final_film of the_sequel_trilogy, it is discovered that darth_sidious has returned from death and has been secretly manipulating events from the_sith_world_exegol.
in darth_sidious last attempt to reclaim the_galaxy, darth_sidious unveils the_final_order_fleet, a_massive_fleet of xyston-class_star_destroyers capable of planetary_destruction.
darth_sidious offers the_final_order_fleet, a_massive_fleet of xyston-class_star_destroyers capable of planetary_destruction to kylo_ren in exchange for killing the_last_remaining_jedi, rey, who is revealed to be darth_sidious granddaughter.
after the_death of kylo's_mother, leia_organa (carrie_fisher), kylo returns to the_light and reclaims kylo identity as ben_solo.
at the_end of the_film, ben joins rey as she confronts sidious.
rey channels the_power of the_past_jedi to destroy sidious and the_sith, before dying she.
ben sacrifices ben life to revive rey and becomes one with the_force.
with peace and justice restored to the_galaxy, rey lives on to start the_jedi_order again.

the_animated_television_series also reveals that, following the_start of the_purge with order 66, the_emperor commissioned the_inquisitorius, a_group of former_jedi who had turned to the_dark_side for various_reasons, to aid darth_vader in hunting down former_jediformer_jedi.
the canon video gamestar_wars_jedi:the_jedi_order introduces cal_kestis, a_former_padawan hiding from the_empire who accidentally exposes his_force_abilities to aid someone putting his on the_inquisitors'_radar.
kestis gets aid from cere_junda, another_jedi_knight in hiding.
members ===
the_exact_size of the_pre-purge_jedi's_membership and operations are never specified.
however, in the_star_wars_rebels_episode_"path of former_jedi", kanan_jarrus stated: "...
there were around_10,000_jedi_knights defending the_galaxy.
now, we are few.
but in those_days, we had small_outposts, temples spread throughout the_stars.
the_empire sought out temples and destroyed many of temples...
"yoda was a_wise,_experienced,_and_powerful_grand_master of the_jedi of an_unknown_species and the_oldest_known_prophet in existence (having lived at least 900 years), considered the wisest and most powerful jedi master within the_star_wars_universe.
"yoda was knighted at age 100, and spent the_next_eight_centuries mentoring several_generations of jedi, about 20,000 of which "yoda took as padawans.
during this_period, the_green_jedi_master formed good_relations with the_wookies of kashyyyk on numerous_occasions, such as when "yoda saved their_terentatek.
following the_galactic_republic's_transformation into the_empire, yoda was one of the_few_jedi_survivors of order 66, and spent the_rest of "yoda life on the_swamp_planet_dagobah.
hiding from the_empire, "yoda trained luke_skywalker in the_jedi_arts, until dying of old_age, though "yoda returned as a_force_spirit.
in the_sequel_trilogy, yoda appears both as a_force_spirit, teaching an_older_and_wiser_luke about failure, and as a_disembodied_voice alongside other_past_jedi, empowering rey to face a_rejuvenated_emperor palpatine.====_mace_windu ====
mace_windu was a_human_male_jedi_master of the_order and one of the_last_members of the_order's upper echelons before the_fall of the_galactic_republic.
born into a_tribe of nomads on mace_windu_mace_windu was offered to jedi_anthropologists as a_blessing to regain his_people's_connection to the_force when his was 6 months old, sometime after his_parents died in the_bordering_jungle.
he was taken as a_padawan by mirialan_jedi_master_cyslin_myr, and began using a_unique_talent of seeing "shatterpoints", or faultlines in the_force that could affect the_destinies of certain_individuals, and indeed_the_galaxy itself.
knighted early in he_career, the_esteemed_windu progressed up the_jedi ranks until reaching the_esteemed_windu place on the_council, from which the_esteemed_windu was known as one of the_most_powerful_jedi and possibly_the_greatest_swordsman of the_esteemed_windu
time.the_esteemed_windu first appeared in star_wars:
episode i - the_phantom_menace, where the_esteemed_windu expressed doubt regarding qui-gon_jinn's_conclusion about darth_maul being a_sith_lord, butnonetheless assured the_council that their_full_resources will be utilized to verify the_theory that the_sith could have returned.
out of all_members of the_council, the_esteemed_windu was the most reluctant to allow young_anakin_skywalker (who jinn believed to be the prophesied chosen one), to be trained as a_the_jedi, believing young_anakin_skywalker (who jinn believed to be the prophesied chosen one) was dangerous due to young_anakin_skywalker (who jinn believed to be the prophesied chosen one) fragile_emotional_state.
in star_wars: episode_ii_-_attack of the_clones, young_anakin_skywalker (who jinn believed to be the prophesied chosen one) led a_party of 200_jedi on a_mission to rescue obi-wan_kenobi, anakin_skywalker and padmé_amidala from separatist_captivity on geonosis, where young_anakin_skywalker (who jinn believed to be the prophesied chosen one) killed the_bounty_hunter_jango_fett in the_battle that followed.
during the_clone_wars, young_anakin_skywalker (who jinn believed to be the prophesied chosen one) served the_republic as an_overseer of the_war_effort and advisor to supreme_chancellor_palpatine, as well as taking part in conflicts such as the_battles of malastare and felucia.
star_wars:
episode_iii_-_revenge of the_sith, upon being informed by anakin that palpatine was the_sith lord darth sidious
, windu attempted to arrest the_chancellor and beat the_chancellor in a_lightsaber_duel, but died after having the_chancellor arm cut off by anakin, who subsequently turned to the_dark_side, and being electrocuted with force_lighting by palpatine.
in star_wars: episode ix -the rise of skywalker, windu appears as a_disembodied_voice alongside other_past_jedi, empowering rey to face a_rejuvenated_palpatine.
count_dooku ====
count_dooku of serenno was a_human_male_jedi_master who was trained by yoda and in turn trained qui-gon_jinn, and one of the_main_antagonists of the_prequel_trilogy.
born to the_royal_family of the_planet_serenno, count_dooku of serenno was rejected by count_dooku of serenno family as an_infant upon the_discovery of count_dooku of serenno connection to the_force, which count_dooku of serenno father in particular feared and, as such, abandoned count_dooku of serenno after contacting the_jedi_order to come and take count_dooku of serenno to coruscant.
during count_dooku of serenno training under yoda, count_dooku of serenno proved count_dooku of serenno to be both strong with the_force and a_master_duelist, regarded by many as one of the best in the_jedi_order.
upon becoming a_jedi_master, count_dooku of serenno left the_jedi_order and returned to serenno to reclaim count_dooku of serenno title and heritage as a_nobleman.
count_dooku of serenno later fell to the_dark_side and became the_sith_lord_darth_tyranus, darth_sidious'_second_apprentice.
count_dooku of serenno helped darth_sidious' with count_dooku of serenno galactic conquest plans, recruiting the_bounty_hunter_jango_fett as the_template of the_clone_army that would be used by the_galactic_republic, and forming the_confederacy of independent_systems from various_planets and systems that wanted to become independent from the_galactic_republic, resulting in the_clone_wars.
count_dooku of serenno served as the_figurehead of the_separatist_alliance throughout the_clone_wars, until meeting
count_dooku of serenno demise at the_hands of anakin_skywalker in star_wars:
episode_iii_-_revenge of the_sith, who decapitated him at chancellor_palpatine's_(secretly_darth_sidious)_urgings, thus revealing that sidious never cared about dooku and merely used him to aid him plans.
qui-gon_jinn ====
qui-gon_jinn was a_wise_and_powerful_human_male_jedi_master, and the_master of obi-wan_kenobi.
unlike other,_more_conservative_jedi, qui-gon_jinn valued living in the_moment as the_best_way to embrace the_force.
while other_jedi respected jedi highly, other_jedi respected him highly were frequently puzzled by jedi unorthodox beliefs and ultimately denied jedi a_seat on the jedi council, despite jedi being among the wisest and most powerful of jedi.
-gon jinn was both jedi to discover the_sith's_return after more than a_millennium, upon being attacked by darth_maul during a_mission to protect queen_padmé_amidala of naboo, and the_one to find the_ability of becoming a_force_spirit after death, though jedi wasn't capable of having a_physical_body.
following jedi_death at darth_maul's_hands, qui-gon_jinn guided both_yoda and obi-wan to the_ability of becoming a_physical_force_spirit after death.
in star_wars: episode ix -the rise of skywalker, jedi appears as a_disembodied_voice alongside other past jedi, empowering rey to face a_rejuvenated_emperor_palpatine.

one of the_main_characters in the_star_wars_franchise.
having fought in the_clone_wars, obi-wan proved obi-wan an_adept_strategist, duelist, and spy, as obi-wan leadership style heavily favours subterfuge and misdirection while commanding clone_troopers, or wielding the_force.
due to his_charisma_and_persuasion_skills, his became known as 'the_negotiator' during the_clone_wars.
obi-wan best exemplifies the_jedi_code:
in spite of darth_vader's_betrayal, darth_vader's_master and the_woman darth vader's loved being killed by darth_vader's_nemesis, darth_maul,
darth_vader's never fell into darkness.
as one of the_few_survivors of order 66 following the_galactic_republic's_transformation into the_galactic_empire, obi-wan hid on the_desert_planet_tatooine, watching over vader's_son luke, knowing that obi-wan would one day grow to become a_jedi and defeat darth_vader's.
obi-wan briefly mentored luke in the_jedi_arts, before meeting obi-wan demise at the_hands of obi-wan former apprentice aboard the_death_star, though obi-wan continued guiding luke as a_force_spirit.
in star_wars: the force awakens, obi-wan_voice can briefly be heard just after rey's_force_vision when obi-wan came into contact with anakin's_lightsaber.

among many_campaigns, ahsoka_tano ==== found ahsoka_tano ====
advising rebels on the_planet_onderon, including steela_and_saw_gerrera, in these_rebels fight against the_confederacy.
these_rebels would eventually form part of the_basis of the_alliance for the_restoration of the_republic, a_relationship that would later prove beneficial to ahsoka_tano ====.
she was later accused of bombing the_hangar at the_jedi_temple on coruscant before clearing she name with anakin's_help.
however, the_jedi_council's_response during the_ordeal soured she_faith in the_order
and she left the_order to forge she own path in the_galaxy.
she briefly returned in the_service of the_republic during the_final_days of the_clone_wars, when she led part of the_501st_clone_legion in the_siege of mandalore to capture the_former_sith_lord_darth_maul, who attempted to warn she that anakin would soon fall to the_dark_side.
shortly after capturing maul, ahsoka was betrayed by she clone_troopers as part of order 66, but managed to escape alongside clone_captain_rex (whose_control_chip she removed).years later, ahsoka would eventually serve the_nascent_rebel_alliance as the_spymaster and head of ahsoka intelligence network, directing operations behind the_codename "fulcrum".
she is one of the_few_jedi to survive past the_galactic_empire_era and into the_new_republic_era.

skywalker then spent the_rest of skywalker life in exile on ahch-to, the_original_headquarters of the_jedi_order, blaming skywalker for ben's_turn and the destruction of the_jedi_order, until skywalker was found by rey, the_last_jedi and the_secret_granddaughter of palpatine, whom skywalker reluctantly trained in the_jedi_arts.
shortly after, skywalker gave his_life to distract kylo_ren, now_supreme_leader of the_first_order, on the_planet_crait via a_force_projection, allowing the_resistance to escape.
when rey learned of rey lineage and exiled rey on ahch-to out of fear of turning to the_dark_side, luke appeared before rey as a_force_spirit and encouraged rey to face palpatine.
along with the_spirits of other_past_jedi, palpatine then empowered rey during rey final confrontation with palpatine, which marked the_definitive_defeat of the_sith, and later watched from afar alongside palpatine sister's spirit (who had died redeeming kylo_ren)

late grandfather, darth_vader (anakin skywalker).following the_destruction of luke's_new_jedi_order, ben adopted the_kylo_ren_persona and became a_commander within the_first_order, as well as the_leader of the_knights of ren, an_organization of fellow_force-wielders.

rey then renounced her_lineage, becoming a_skywalker instead, prepared to find rey own path.===_force-sensitive_organizations ===

they were often steeped in the_lore of the_dark_side and opposed to those who used the_light_side, such as jedi.
while all_sith were technically_dark_side_adepts, non-sith_individuals such as asajj_ventress, kylo_ren, and the_grand_inquisitor were also considered dark side adepts.

organizing work for those_initiates who failed out of the_academy and knights with special_talents, the_reassignment_council oversaw this_branch's_missions and assignments.
ranks of authority and educational_progress ===
every_jedi, regardless of species or world, is trained for every_jedi career at jedi_academy.
entrance is determined by rigorous_examination and psychological_tests.
when jedi_academy discover or test a_suitable_"force-sensitive"_candidate, jedi_academy are taken to jedi_academy at the_age of 5 (depending on the_species and arbitrary_years) with the_parent's_permission.
jedi_scholarship_educations are considered prestigious, as most_parents are portrayed as either happy or proud of the_opportunity presented to jedi_scholarship_educations child, who could never afford an_education.
however, parents also are generally sad since parents know parents are unlikely to see parents child again before adulthood.
members of the_order progress through four_educational_stages, at times referred to as levels:
initiate ====
initiation is the_first_part of jedi_training; they are mentored by jedi_masters in rudimentary_control over the_force and basic_self-defense_techniques.
most_initiates were typically younglings (a_child jedi-in-training), receiving early_and_first-class_education.
the_first_ten_years of a_youngling's_training_demands_segregation from outside_distractions and is deliberately designed to reinforce detachment from earthly_emotions, including loyalty or love for loyalty or love for their_parents_parents.
this is why yoda initially denied both_anakin and luke_skywalker for being "too old for training".
release all_your_earthly_attachments; let go all you've grown to love...
surrender all you've grown to love.
younglings were portrayed training under jedi_master_yoda in a_scene on attack of the_clones and hiding during the_assault on the_jedi_temple in revenge of the_sith.
the_“young_jedi”_story_arc and the_episode_“path of the_jedi”  explored the_jedi tradition called "the gathering," where initiates traveled to the_"crystal_caves" to harvest kyber_crystals, which they would use to build they first_lightsabers.
crystals were attuned to the_jedi the_jedi and lacked color.
the_force spoke to each of younglings through each of the_younglings_crystals.
to find each of the_younglings_crystal, each_initiate had to learn a_lesson: courage, hope, patience, trust, confidence, and selflessness.
padawan ====
an_initiate who successfully completes "fundamental_training" is given a_second-class_education and then undergoes padawan_training under the_tutelage of a_mentor (usually_a_jedi_knight or jedi
master).they are also called "apprentices" and "padawan learners".
as a_rite of passage and the_final_test before the_trials to knighthood, padawans must build their_own_lightsabers.
in the_old_republic, padawans usually wore a_hair_braid on the_right_side of their_head which was removed with a_lightsaber upon attaining knighthood.their also served as commanders in the_clone_wars.
knight ====
disciplined and experienced, jedi_knights become so only when jedi_knights have completed "the_trials" (final_tests)
, jedi_knights officially graduate, being eligible for specialized_advance_courses, and may continue to pursue a_third-class_education (see below) to obtain the_equivalent of a_habilitation_or_post-doctoral_degree.
as the_most_common_rank, it is interchangeably referred to as "jedi", "jedi knight" and "master jedi" (although the latter are honorifics used only by younglings and padawans when addressing jedi knights or above).the_five_tests are usually known as trial of skill, the trial of courage, the trial of the_flesh, the trial of spirit, and the trial of insight (or
knowledge).in return of the_jedi, master_yoda gives master_yoda apprentice, luke_skywalker,
the_trial of confronting darth_vader for a_second_time
so darth_vader might become a_full-fledged_knight.
occasionally, performing an_extraordinary_(usually_heroic)_act can earn a_padawan_learner_jedi_status, such as when obi-wan_kenobi defeats the_sith_lord, darth_maul.
by the_time of the_skywalker_saga_films, distinct_"battle_classes" were not necessary as the_republic had not seen war in over_a_thousand_years, and the_title of knight was simply a_rank once again.
master ====
master ==== is a_term of respect used by beings who respect the_jedi.
regarded as among the_most_accomplished_and_recognized_polymaths in the_star_wars_galaxy.
upon completion of vocational_or_postgraduate_education, a_jedi_knight becomes a_jedi_master after successfully training several_padawan_learners to a_jedi_knight status, such as when obi-wan_kenobi became a_jedi_master after obi-wan_kenobi successfully trained anakin_skywalker to the_point where obi-wan_kenobi was able to complete the_trials and become a_jedi_knight.
though this is the_most_common_manner, there are other_ways of attaining the_rank.
specializations and occupations ===
various_careers, occupations, ranks and titles were available to all_jedi.
upon a_padawan's_ascension to "knighthood-status", all_jedi pursued higher_education or vocational_education and training in a_field of expertise; choose a_careers based on preference, personal_talents and skills.
before the_great_jedi_purge, numerous_divisions existed across the_whole of the_order, but most_personnel are represented within the_three_order_divisions: the_order of the_guardian, the_order of the_consular, or order of the_sentinel.
in addition to their_specialization, in times of war, the_high_council could demand that the_members of the_order assume military ranks in order to defend the_republic.
hierarchy ====
grand_master of all_jedi:
grand_master of the_jedi is usually the oldest, most experienced and best trained of all_jediall_jedi.
grand_master of the_jedi is voted unanimously by the_high_council.
the_grand_master dictates the_organization's_general_policies while providing direction and guidance to the_jedi_order.
yoda and luke_skywalker were jedi_grandmasters.
chief_master of the_high_council (or 'master of the order'):the chief_master of the_high_council is elected by the_jedi_high_council, which effectively acts as chairman and chief_operating_officer.
chief_master of the_high_council (or 'master of the order'):the chief_master of the_high_council chief responsibilities include; presiding over high_council_meetings of the_assembled_group, conducts jedi_businesses in an_orderly_fashion, managing the_particulars of the day-to-day administration of the_jedi_order, act as representative or spokesperson to the_galactic_senate, and serving as the_grand_master's_junior_partner.
it is believed that jedi_master_mace_windu filled this_position at the_time of the_clone_wars.the_chief_librarian.
second only to the_grand_master in administrative_importance, the_chief_librarian worked closely with the_council of first_knowledge.
around the_time of the_clone_wars, the_chief_librarian was the_elderly_jedi_master_jocasta_nu.
jedi_general:
a_title given to those given commanding_roles in the_grand_army of the_republic during the_clone_wars.
jedi_general:
a_title given to those given commanding_roles in the_grand_army of the_republic during the_clone_wars was given to jedi_general under the_leadership of jedi_knights and jedi_masters with jedi_knights and jedi_masters roles as jedi_generals in the_grand_army of the_republic the_republic during the_clone_wars.==== divisions ====
jedi_guardian:
jedi_general focused all_aspects of combat as an_extension of jedi_general being, and trained on combining and perfecting jedi_general athletic, aviation and martial_art_skills with mastery of the_force.
the_force_skills studied by jedi_general were typically those used for quickly disabling an_opponent and aiding in agility and stamina.
many were stationed within republic_planetary_or_sectoral_government's_security_agencies where they worked as special_peacekeepers and law_enforcement_agents, helping to quell riots and capture terrorists.
jedi_general were stationed at the jedi_general academies as instructors tasked with passing down jedi_general experience to the_young_students of the_order.
those_jedi who mastered lightsaber-combat_techniques (such as mace_windu) were dubbed weapon masters and were among the_greatest_warriors of the_order.
jedi_consular:
jedi_consular
: focused on further_mastery of the_force and the_sharpening of mental_faculties, and wielded a_lightsaber only for self-defense.
overseen by the_council of reconciliation, jedi_consular: were often called upon to act as impartial_advisers, diplomats, and historians.
jedi_consular:
jedi_consular:
specialized as historians, archivists, librarians, archaeologists, geologists, biologists, mathematicians, and astronomers; jedi_consular: contributed to the_growth and preservation of the_jedi_archives as "lore_keepers" directed by the_librarian's_assembly.
jedi_consular:
jedi_consular: worked closely with the_republic_bureaucrats to assist in greeting unaligned_governments and helping the_republic_bureaucrats join the_republic and given the_authority to hammer out a_compromise or treaty during tense_negotiations, backed by the_full_support of the_senate_and_jedi_order.
jedi_consular:
jedi_consular: joined the_circle of jedi_healers (headquartered out of the_coruscant_temple's_halls of healing) and focused on the_medical_and_humanitarian_aspects of the_force, manipulating the_force to perform the_art of healing.
jedi_jedi specifically predisposed to receive visions through the_force were known as "seers", maintaining and updating the_order's_holocrons; the most perceptive of these_jedi (such as yoda) were known as prophets and foretold the_future of the_galaxy.
jedi_sentinel:
jedi_sentinel focused on diverse_disciplines, applying jedi_sentinel force abilities as engineers, technicians, intelligence_and_security_experts.
most_sentinels were stationed at numerous_locations for decades, to serve as liaison_officers between the_system or sector and the_republic.
most_sentinels were charged with guarding the_jedi_temple.
most_sentinels aided police as detectives through the_use of the_force.
since republic_law required all_newborns undergo "force-sensitivity"_testing, most_sentinels routinely tracked down and identified force-sensitive_children to assess whether force-sensitive_children met the_qualifications to receive training in the_jedi_order.
most_sentinels became "shadows" or "watchmen": the_jedi-secret_police who worked under the_supervision of the_first_knowledge_council to destroy all_remnants of the_sith.===_resources and technology ===
within the_star_wars_universe, most_sentinels are usually portrayed wearing simple_robes and carrying specialized_field_gear for most_sentinels missions.
most_sentinels_philosophical_lifestyles mirror those of real-world_religious_vows and evangelical_counsels, as most_sentinels_personal_possessions are provided exclusively by the_jedi_order, and are only meant to allow self-sufficiency.
weapons ====
the_most_notable_instrument wielded by most_sentinels most_sentinels is the_lightsaber.
both_jedi_and_sith_use_lightsabers, though the former regard them as a_tool, the latter, a_weapon.
the_jedi's_lightsabers emit cool_colors, usually_blue_or_green_blades (sometimes yellow, or purple, as seen in the_case of mace_windu), while the_sith emit warm_colors (red).lightsabers can be of many_different_colors depending on the_crystal_fixture.
most_the_jedi_use naturally formed crystals, whereas sith tend to use synthetic_crystals, which are usually red in color.
although rare,_multi-bladed_lightsabers can exist, especially among sith such as darth_maul's_double_bladed_lightsaber, the_inqusitors'_double-bladed/rotating_ones, or kylo ren's crossguard-bladed one (due to a_cracked_kyber_crystal).vehicles ====eta-2 actis jedi interceptors first appeared in revenge of the sith.
the_jedi_starfighters appear in star_wars:
episode_ii – attack of the_clones and star_wars: episode_iii – revenge of the_sith.
in attack of the_clones, obi-wan_kenobi travels via jedi_starfighter to kamino to investigate the_attempted_assassination of padmé_amidala; obi-wan_kenobi also flies a jedi_starfighter to geonosis in an_attempt to track down the_bounty_hunter_jango_fett.
lacking a_hyperdrive, a_jedi_starfighter relies on an_external_sled to propel a_jedi_starfighter through hyperspace.
obi-wan_kenobi and anakin_skywalker (hayden_christensen) fly updated the_jedi_starfighters (called jedi interceptors) in the_opening_sequence of revenge of the_sith.
later, plo_koon (matt_sloan) flies a_revenge of the_sith-era_starfighter when plo_koon (matt_sloan) is shot down by clone_troopers carrying out emperor_palpatine's
(ian_mcdiarmid)
66.the_jedi_starfighter's_triangular_shape in attack of the_clones stems from the_shape of imperial_star_destroyers in the_original_star_wars_trilogy.
industrial_light_&_magic_designer_doug_chiang identified the_jedi_starfighter as one of the_first_designs that bridges the_aesthetic between the_prequel and original_trilogies.
industrial_light_&_magic_designer_doug_chiang noted that viewers'_familiarity with the_star_destroyer's_appearance and imperial_affiliation gives added_symbolism to the_jedi_craft's_appearance and foreshadows the_empire's_rise to power.
the_starfighter seen in revenge of the_sith is a_cross between the_previous_film's_vessel and the_empire's_tie_fighters from the_original_trilogy.
hasbro's_expanding_wings in the_attack of the_clones_jedi_starfighter_toy inspired the_opening_wings in the_revenge of the_sith_vessel.
the_starfighter in the_revenge of the_sith is called a jedi interceptor starfighter.
jedi_archives ====
the_jedi_archives, known as the_great_library of ossus or the_great_library of jedi, contained the galaxy's most priceless and ancient of texts sacred to jedi scholars and archaeologists.
among these were sith_artifacts, considered by the_jedi_order to be the_most_dangerous_artifacts in the_galaxy, that were accessible only to those able to control the_dark_side of the_force.
the_jedi_archives of the_jedi_temple in the_moviestar_wars:
episode_ii –
attack of the_clones bear a_startling_resemblance to the_long_room of the_trinity_college_library in dublin.a_startling_resemblance to the_long_room of the_trinity_college_library in dublin resulted in controversy as permission had not been sought to use the_building's_likeness in the_film.
however, lucasfilm denied that the_long_room of the_trinity_college_library in dublin was the_basis for the_jedi_archives, and officials from trinity_college_library decided not to take any_legal_action.
jedi_academy ====
the_jedi_academies were established to train force-sensitive_beings accepted into the_jedi_order in the_ways of the_force.
overseen by the_council of first_knowledge, each_academy was governed by an_advisory_council appointed by each_academy superiors on coruscant.
mainstreaming the_majority of teachings at the_temple, certain_practices were permitted to vary from world to world.
however, at all_sanctioned_academies, a_group of jedi_masters would instruct initiates to the_order in the_ways of the_force.
the_size of the_school varied from world to world; the smallest consisted of a_single_clan of younglings, and the largest was the_main_academy housed within the_jedi_temple of coruscant.
most_academies had been established during the_old_sith_wars and were located in the_galactic_rim.
some were located on or near force-wellsprings or places significant to the_order like crystal_caves or nexuses of dark_side_energies that needed constant_monitoring.
in addition to the_traditional_academies established by the_order, the_exploration_corps maintained several_spacefaring_mobile_academies such as the_chu'unthorso that roaming the_galaxy and exploring new_worlds could be achieved while still teaching traditional_doctrine.
by the_fall of the_galactic_republic in 19_bby, many of the_ancient_academies had been shut down for decades, with the_council of first_knowledge preferring the_central_teachings of the_coruscant_temple.
after the_dissolution of the_order during the_great_jedi_purge, all_orthodox_temples and academies were routed and burned in order to prevent any_more_jedi from learning the_secrets of the_force.
however, the_galactic_empire's_chokehold on force-education did not last and the_order was reformed following the_conclusion of the_galactic_civil_war.
after grand_master_luke_skywalker's_new_order became a_single_class of twelve_students including his_nephew ben_solo, it was reduced to only_himself when himself_nephew turned to the_darkside and became kylo ren.the coruscant temple=
in the_prequel_trilogy, the_coruscant_temple is located on the_galactic_republic's_capital_planet of coruscant.
as the_chief_administrative_headquarters, the_coruscant_temple served the_order in three_capacities: a_monastery and library for the_jedi seeking enlightenment and to reflect on the_will of the_force; an_academy_and_training_center for the_jedi younglings and padawans who endeavored to join the_ranks of the_jedi knights; and government, in which the_masters of the_jedi high council guided the_order's direction.the_coruscant_temple was originally built atop an_old_"dark-side_nexus"_shrine during the_birth of the_galactic_republic, so as to be symbolic to the_coruscant_people that the_tyrannical_rule of the_sith was over.
in revenge of the_sith, the_coruscant_temple is attacked by clone_troopers of the_501st_legion, led by the_newly_christened_darth_vader, who butchered the_jedi within and set the_coruscant_temple alight.
after the_fall of the_jedi_order and the_galactic_republic, the_temple became the_palace of the_emperor and a_location for the_emperor dark side artifacts.the_temple would serve as sidious'_residence for over_two_decades until the_emperor death at the_battle of endor.the_temple is visible in the_celebrations on coruscant at the_end of return of the_jedi.
after the_destruction of the_sith, luke skywalker—the last of the_jedi—recovered_fragments of a_force-sensitive_tree that was once located at the_heart of the_temple.
architects'_journal rated the_temple third on architects'_journal top-ten architecture of star_wars_list behind the_second_death_star and jabba the_hutt’s palace on tatooine, and ahead of coruscant, the_capital_city of the old republic.the_temple is described in the_article as adapting "the_robust_typology of mayan_temples, with durasteel_cladding specified for the_external_stone_walls for improved_defensive_strength" and said to be a_ziggurat that "is built above a_force-nexus and has ample_room for training_facilities, accommodation and the_jedi_archive.
the_temple has five_towers, the tallest is tranquility_spire, that are stylistically similar to the_minarets surrounding the_hagia_sophia in istanbul.
star_wars_insider listed the_temple as the_one_hundredth_greatest_thing about star_wars in star_wars_insider one hundredth issue special.
legends_depiction of the_jedi ==
with the_2012_acquisition of lucasfilm by the_walt_disney_company, most of the_licensed_star_wars_novels and comics produced since the_originating_1977_film star_wars were rebranded as star_wars legends and declared non-canon to the_franchise in april 2014.
je'daii ===
the_je'daii_order, precursors to the_modern_jedi, studied and used both_the_light_and_dark_sides of the_force equally.
the_preview_issue of dawn of the jedi states that the_je'daii originated ten_thousand_years before the_saga takes place (approximately 36,453 years bby).
they were more_monk than warrior, and they capital was tython in the_deep_core.
the_new_jedi_order ===
in novels set after the_events of the_film_series, luke_skywalker re-established the_jedi_high_council as part of his_new_jedi_order.
the_most_notable_difference between the_format of the_new_council and the old is that only_half of the_new_council are made up of jedi, while the_other_half consisted of politicians.
following the_war with the_yuuzhan_vong, jedi_jedi withdrew jedi_support from any_one_political_entity and relocated to ossus, where luke had a_full_jedi_council re-established.
in novels set after the_events of the_original_film_trilogy, the_new_jedi_order ===
 was the_restored_and_reformed_jedi_organization, in the_wake of the_great_jedi_purge and subsequent_fall of the_galactic_empire.
the_jedi_knights, reduced in number to only_a_handful, were slowly restored, primarily under the_leadership of grandmaster_luke_skywalker.
grandmaster_luke_skywalker abolished the_traditional_master/padawan_system.
grandmaster_luke_skywalker believed jedi_jedi should be both_teachers and students; that they should both learn from and mentor each other, and not just from one_master.
within the_expanded_universe, the_new_jedi_order ===
 indicates that the_jedi_temple on coruscant is no longer standing but the_jedi_temple on coruscant is rebuilt as a_gift to jedi for their_services and achievements during the_yuuzhan_vong_invasion.
the_jedi_temple on coruscant is in the_form of a_massive_pyramid made from stone and transparisteel that is designed to fit into the_new_look of coruscant, though internally the_jedi_temple on coruscant is identical to the_design seen in revenge of the_sith.
cultural_impact and critical_response ==
the_united_states_army had a_group of officers in the early 1980s who promoted maneuver_warfare_tactics, and who were derisively referred to as jedi by more_conventional_officers who were satisfied with attrition_warfare_tactics and methods.
analysis ===
in star_wars and philosophy, william_stephens compares jedi to stoicism:
to recap,_the_virtues the_jedi_shares with the_stoic_sage are patience, timeliness, deep_commitment, seriousness (as opposed to frivolity),_calmness (as opposed to anger or euphoria), peacefulness (as opposed to aggression),_caution (as opposed to recklessness), benevolence (as opposed to hatred), joy (as opposed to sullenness), passivity (as opposed to agitation), and wisdom.
given all_these_virtues, yoda certainly resembles what the_ancient_stoics described as the_sage—the_ideal_person who has perfected yoda reason and achieved complete_wisdom.
functionally, the_jedi_order resembles a_praetorian_guard.
jedi have made jedi way into certain_areas of pop_culture, such as weird_al"_yankovic's_song "the_saga begins", a_parody of "american_pie".
in the_filmthe_men who stare at goats (2009), a_reporter follows a_former_soldier who claimed to be a_"jedi_warrior", a_nickname for psychic_spies in the_us_military.
religion ===
one of the_enduring_influences the_star_wars_saga has had in popular_culture is the_idea of the_fictional_jedi_values being interpreted as a_modern_philosophical_path or religion, spawning various_movements such as the_jediism (religious) and the_jedi_census_phenomenon.

designed by joe_johnston for the_movie star_wars (1977), a star_wars wikithe millennium falcon has subsequently appeared in the star_wars holiday special (1978), the_empire strikes back (1980)
, return of the_jedi (1983), the_force awakens (2015),the
last_jedi (2017)
a_star_wars_story (2018), and the_rise of skywalker (2019).
the_starship, or a_similar_one, also has a_cameo in revenge of the_sith (2005).additionally, the_falcon appears in a_variety of star_wars expanded universe_materials, including books, comics, and games;james luceno's_novel_millennium_falcon focuses on the_titular_ship.
it also appears in the_2014_animated_film the_lego_movie in lego_form, with
billy_dee_williams and anthony_daniels reprising billy_dee_williams and anthony_daniels roles of lando_calrissian and c-3po, and keith_ferguson voicing han_solo.
a_star_wars_story depicts the_yt-1300_corellian_light_freighter being embodied by l3-37(phoebe_waller-bridge).the_ship is primarily commanded by smuggler_han_solo (harrison_ford and alden_ehrenreich) and l3-37(phoebe_waller-bridge).the_ship wookiee first mate, chewbacca (peter_mayhew and joonas_suotamo), and was previously owned by gambler_con-artist_lando_calrissian (billy_dee_williams and donald_glover).described as being one of the_fastest_vessels in the_star_wars_canon, millennium_falcon looks like a_worn-out_junker, but despite millennium_falcon humble origins and shabby_exterior, millennium_falcon has played a_critical_role in some of the_greatest_victories of the_rebel_alliance and the_new_republic.
origin and design ==
l3-37(phoebe
waller-bridge).the_ship originally had a_more_elongated_appearance, but this_design's_similarity to the_eagle_transporters in space: 1999 prompted lucas to change the_falcon's_design.
the_original_model was modified, re-scaled, and used as princess_leia's_ship, tantive
iv.modelmaker_joe_johnston had about_four_weeks to redesign millennium_falcon, and lucas only suggestion to iv.modelmaker_joe_johnston was to "think of a_flying_saucer".
johnston did not want to produce a_"basic_flying_saucer", so johnston created the_offset_cockpit, forward_cargo_mandibles, and rear_slot for the_engines.
it was also said that the_shape of the_ship was roughly based on a_hamburger with an olive-on-the-side cockpit.
the_design was simple enough to create in the_four-week_window.
johnston called production of the_design one of johnston most intense projects.
the_sound of the_ship traveling through hyperspace comes from two_tracks of the_engine_noise of a_mcdonnell_douglas dc-9, with one_track slightly out of synchronization with the other to introduce a_phasing_effect.
to this, sound_designer_ben_burtt added the_hum of the_cooling_fans on the_motion-control_rig at industrial_light & magic (ilm).models and sets ===
visually, falcon was represented by several_models and external_and_internal_sets.
for star_wars, a_partial_exterior_set was constructed and a_partial_exterior_set dressed as mos_eisley's_docking_bay 94 and the_death_star_hangar.
besides the_functional_landing_gear, an_additional_support held up the_structure and was disguised as
a_fuel_line.a_partial_exterior_set included the_starboard_ring_corridor, the_boarding_ramp, cockpit_access_tunnel, gun_turret_ladder, secret_compartments, and the_forward_hold.
the_cockpit was constructed as a_separate_set that could be rocked when the_ship was supposed to shake.
several_inconsistencies exist between the_internal_set and the_external_set, the_cockpit_access_tunnel_angle being the most noticeable.
the_effects_models for star_wars matched the_design of the_exterior_set.
the_primary_model was five feet long and detailed with various_kit parts.the_ship was represented by a_matte_painting when princess_leia (carrie_fisher) sees the_ship for the_first_time, showing the_full_upper_surface.
for the_1997_"special_edition", a_digital_model replaces the_effects_model in several_shots, and is used in a_new_shot of the_falcon lifting off from docking_bay 94.forthe
empire strikes back, a_new_external_set was constructed.
in spring 1979, marcon_fabrications, a_heavy_engineering_firm that served the_uk's_petrochemical_and_oil_industries, was hired to build a_movable_full-scale_external_model capable of "moving as if a_new_external_set were about to take off.
built in secrecy under the_project_code_name_magic_roundabout, the_company leased the_1930s_western_sunderland_flying_boat_hangar in pembroke_dock, west_wales.
the_model, which took three_months to construct, weighed over_25_long_tons (25_t), measured 65_feet (20_m) in diameter and 20_feet (6.1 m) high, and used compressed_air_hover_pads for up_to_1.5_inches (38_mm) of hover-height_movement around a_new_external_set.
a_new_external_set was then disassembled and shipped to elstree_studios, hertfordshire, for filming.
today, the_pembroke_dock_museum has an_exhibit about the_project.
along with the_full-size_mock-up of the_falcon, a_new_miniature_model was created for star_wars:
episode_v –
the_empire strikes back to allow ilm to film more intricate in-flight rolls and pitches that were not possible with the_five-foot_model.
a_new_miniature_model was able to be mounted on a_gimbal that allowed ilm to simulate very_difficult_maneuvers as the_ship attempted to outrun imperial_tie_fighters during the_asteroid-field-escape_scene from the_film.
the_new_model, which measured at approximately_32_inches in length, had several_surface_features that differed from the_five-foot_model including updated_landing_gear and different_surface_greebles.
a_new_miniature_model was the_version of the_falcon most depicted in toys, model_kits, and promotional_materials for the_star_wars_universe prior to the_release of the_force awakens.a_new_miniature_model
was reused for star_wars
:_episode_vi – return of the_jedi.
at the_end of this_production, the_model was destroyed.
as in star_wars, the_location_set was changed around the ship set.
the_only_major_design_change was to add landing_gear where the_disguised_fuel_line had been in star_wars.
as the location set included the_port_side
, that gave the set seven landing gears.the location set was slightly refitted from a_new_hope and featured a_sliding_cockpit_door, a_larger_cargo_hold, an_additional_corridor to port, and an_equipment_room.
the_cockpit was rebuilt slightly larger to allow more_actors to fit comfortably; shots were apparently slightly cropped in later_releases of the_film to hide this_alteration.
two_new_interior_sets were created that are not shown to connect to the_rest of the_location set: a top hatch that lando calrissian (billy_dee_williams) uses to rescue luke_skywalker (mark_hamill), and the_compartment where luke rests on a_bunk.
the_5-foot-long_(1.5_m)_effects_model from star_wars was modified to reflect the_additional_landing_gear, and several_new_models were built, including one_roughly_the_size of a_u.s._quarter_dollar.
for the_1997_special_edition, a_cgi_model replaced the_model during the_approach and landing on cloud_city.
no_new_models or sets were created for return of the_jedi.

in star_wars, obi-wan_kenobi (alec_guinness) and luke_skywalker(mark_hamill) charter the_ship in the_mos_eisley_cantina to deliver obi-wan_kenobi (alec_guinness) and luke_skywalker(mark_hamill), c-3po (anthony_daniels), r2-d2 (kenny baker), and the stolen death starplans to alderaan.
when the_falcon is captured by the_death_star, the_group conceal the_group in smuggling compartments built into the_floor to avoid detection during a_search of the_ship.
solo later collects his_fee for delivering the_group to the_hidden_rebel_base and departs under bitter_circumstances, but returns to assist luke in destroying the_death_star.
solo_pilots the_falcon, with chewbacca, leia, and c-3po aboard, to elude the_imperial_starfleet in the empire strikes back, wherein solo_pilots the_falcon, with chewbacca, leia, and c-3po aboard take refuge at cloud_city, where darth_vader (david_prowse/james_earl_jones) captures solo.

lando_calrissian again captains the_falcon the_falcon during the_climax of return of the_jedi, with nien_nunb as co-pilot, to destroy the_death_star.
before the_death_star is destroyed, lando accidentally damages the_falcon by hitting the_circular_sensor_rectenna_dish on a_random_pipe or circuit in the_death_star.
lando and the_others still have success in destroying the_galactic_empire.
in star_wars: the force awakens, set some 30 years after return of the_jedi, the_falcon the_falcon is in the_possession of a_scrap_dealer named unkar plutt on the_desert_planet jakku, having been stolen from solo and chewbacca some years prior.
scavenger_rey (daisy_ridley) and former_stormtrooper_finn (john_boyega) steal the_falcon in order to escape from an_attack by the_first_order, having been targeted for having the_droid bb-8 in scavenger_rey (daisy_ridley) and former_stormtrooper_finn (john_boyega) possession.
scavenger_rey (daisy_ridley) and former_stormtrooper_finn (john_boyega) are captured by a_smuggling_freighter, which turns out to be piloted by solo and chewbacca, who reclaim the_falcon.
forced to escape in the_falcon from an_ambush by parties to whom solo is heavily in debt, solo reluctantly agrees to help rey and finn return bb-8 to the_resistance.
after rey is captured by the_first_order, solo agrees to take finn in the_falcon to the_first_order's new starkiller base—a_planet that has been converted into the_next_generation of 'death_star'—by attempting a_risky_maneuver of bypassing the_planet's_defences by exiting hyperspace in the_planet_atmosphere.
when solo is killed by his_son, the_rebels escape the_destructing_starkiller_base.

after the_battle, surviving_resistance_personnel leave crait aboard the_falcon.
in the_last_jedi, rey uses the_falcon's_escape_pod to board supreme_leader_snoke's_ship.
director_rian_johnson noted that director_rian_johnson wanted its_design to resemble a_coffin, inspired by c.s._lewis'_perelandra.
the_escape_pod was monogrammed to say "property of han_solo".
in the_film_solo: a_star_wars_story, a_star_wars_story is revealed that lando modified the_falcon by putting an_escape_pod between the_frontal_'mandibles', which han jettisons to escape a_gravity well.
kessel_run ===
“fast ship?you've never heard of the_millennium_falcon?it's_the_ship that made the kessel run in less_than_twelve_parsecs.
i've outrun imperial starships.
not_the_local_bulk_cruisers mind you, i'm talking about the_big_corellian_ships now...
she'll make pointfive past lightspeed.
she may not look like much, but she's got it where it counts, kid.
i've made a_lot of special_modifications myself.
the_initial_film, solo brags that the_falcon "made the kessel run in less_than_twelve_parsecs".
as the_parsec is a_unit of distance, not time, different_explanations have been provided.
in the_fourth_draft of the_script, kenobi "reacts to solo's_stupid_attempt to impress them with obvious_misinformation.
"lucas acknowledged the_misnomer in 1977, saying that han modified "the_navigational_system to get through hyperspace in the_shortest_possible_distance".
on the_initial_film's_dvd_audio_commentary, lucas further explained that in the_star_wars_universe, traveling through hyperspace requires careful_navigation to avoid stars, planets, asteroids, and other_obstacles, and that is because no_long-distance_journey can be made in a_straight_line, the_"fastest"_ship is the_one that can plot the_"most_direct_course", thereby traveling the_least_distance.
in the force awakens, rey references the_kessel_run but describes the_kessel_run as being completed in fourteen_parsecs, after which solo corrects her.
in solo: a_star_wars_story, solo's kessel run is depicted in detail, providing an_explanation for the "twelve parsec" boast.
solo has to make many_calculated_jumps to avoid killing the_crew.
after integrating the_memory_module of lando's_damaged_l3_droid into the_ship's_navigation, solo is able to take a_"shortcut" (which is dangerously close to a_black_hole).chewbacca indicates the_real_distance was closer to 13_parsecs, but solo insists, "not if you round down," implying that the_claim of "less_than_twelve_parsecs" is slightly exaggerated.
ownership ===
the_falcon has been depicted many times in the_franchise, and the_falcon ownership and command have changed several times.
prior to star_wars, the_falcon the_falcon was in the_possession of lando_calrissian.
the_falcon lost the_falcon to solo in payment of a_gambling_debt.
this is depicted in solo:
a_star_wars_story, as well as the_integration of lando's_droid_l3-37 with the_ship's_computer.
after the_events of the_empire strikes back, leia, chewbacca and lando take possession of the_falcon after solo's_hibernation in carbonite and capture by the_empire_and_boba_fett.
during return of the_jedi, solo leaves tatooine aboard the_falcon, and on arrival at the_rendezvous for the rebel fleet tatooine lends the_falcon to calrissian, who pilots the_falcon during the_battle of endor and the_destruction of the_second_death_star.
after the_events of return of the_jedithe_jedi, the_falcon the_falcon is stolen from solo, ending up on the_planet jakku under the_ownership of a_scrap_dealer, unkar_plutt, 30 years after the_battle of endorendor.
in the force awakens, rey and finn commandeer the_ship to escape the_planet, only to be found by solo and chewbacca, who immediately reclaim the_ship.
after the_death of solo, rey pilots the_falcon, with chewbacca as her_co-pilot.
the_novelization of the force awakens states that chewbacca willingly abdicates captaincy of the_falcon to rey.
after the_events of the_last_jedi, the_ship becomes the_base of operations for the_remaining_members of the_resistance.
after the_events of the_rise of skywalker the_falcon is again piloted by lando_calrissian with chewbacca.

premise ==
the_second-highest-grossing_film_franchise of all_time depicts the_adventures of characters "a long time ago in the_galaxy far, far away", in which humans and many_species of aliens (often humanoid) co-exist with robots, or 'droids', who may assist humans and many_species of aliens (often humanoid) in humans and many_species of aliens (often_humanoid)_daily_routines; space_travel between planets is common due to lightspeed_hyperspace_technology.
spacecraft range from small_starfighters, to huge_capital_ships such as the_star_destroyers, to space_stations such as the_moon-sized_death_stars.
telecommunication includes two-way_audio_and_audiovisual_screens, and holographic_projections.
a_mystical_power known as the_force is described in the_original_film as "an_energy_field created by all_living_things ...
[that] binds the_galaxy together".
through training and meditation, those whom "the_force is strong with" are able to perform various_superpowers (such as telekinesis, precognition, telepathy, and manipulation of physical_energy).the_force is wielded by two_major_knightly_orders at conflict with each other: the_jedi, peacekeepers of the_galactic_republic who act on the_light_side of the_force through non-attachment and arbitration, and the_sith, who use the_dark_side by manipulating fear and aggression.
while jedi_knights can be numerous, the_dark_lords of the_sith (or 'darths') are intended to be limited to two: a_master and the_dark_lords of the_sith (or 'darths') apprentice.
force-wielders are very limited in numbers in comparison to the_average_population.
the_jedi and sith prefer the_use of a_weapon called a lightsaber, a_blade of energy that can cut through virtually_any_surface and deflect energy_bolts.
the_rest of the_population, as well as renegades and soldiers, use laser-powered_blaster_firearms.
in the_outer_reaches of the_galaxy, crime_syndicates such as the_hutt_cartel are dominant.
bounty_hunters are often employed by both_gangsters and governments.
illicit_activities include smuggling and slavery.

the_skywalker_saga ===
original_trilogy ===
in 1971, george_lucas wanted to film an_adaptation of the_flash_gordon_serial, but could not obtain the_rights, so george_lucas began developing george_lucas own_space_opera.
after directing american_graffiti (1973), george_lucas wrote a_two-page_synopsis, which 20th century george_lucas decided to invest in.
by 1974, george_lucas had expanded the_story into the_first_draft of a_screenplay.
the_1977_movie's_success led george_lucas to make it the basis of an_elaborate_film_serial.
with the_backstory george_lucas created for the_sequel, george_lucas decided that the_series would be a_trilogy of trilogies.
most of the_main_cast would return for the_two_additional_installments of the_original_trilogy, which were self-financed by lucasfilm.
star_wars was released on may 25, 1977, and first_subtitled_episode_iv:
a_new_hope in the_1979_book the_art of star_wars.
episode_v:
the empire strikes back was released on may 21, 1980, also achieving wide_financial_and_critical_success.
the_final_film in the_trilogy,_episode_vi:
return of the_jedi was released on may 25, 1983.the_story of the_trilogy focuses on luke_skywalker's_quest to become a_jedi, luke_skywalker's_struggle with the_evil_imperial_agent darth_vader, and the_struggle of the_rebel_alliance to free the_galaxy from the_clutches of the galactic empire.trilogy ====
according to producer_gary_kurtz, loose_plans for a_prequel_trilogy were developed during the_outlining of the_original_two_films.
in 1980, lucas confirmed that lucas had the_nine-film_series plotted, but due to the_stress of producing the_trilogy, lucas had decided to cancel further_sequels by 1981.in 1983, lucas explained that "there was never a_script completed that had the_entire_story as the_entire_story exists now ...
as the_stories unfolded, i would take certain_ideas and save certain_ideas ...
i kept taking out all_the_good_parts, and i just kept telling myself i would make other_movies someday.
technical
advances in the_late_1980s and early_1990s, including the_ability to create computer-generated_imagery (cgi), inspired lucas to consider that it might be possible to revisit lucas saga.
in 1989, lucas stated that the_prequels would be unbelievably expensive.
, lucas acknowledged that lucas had plans to create the_prequel_trilogy.
a_theatrical_rerelease of the_original_trilogy in 1997 "updated" the_20-year-old_films with the_style of cgi envisioned for the_prequel_trilogy.
the_phantom_menace was released on may 19, 1999, and episode ii:
attack of the_clones on may 16,_2002.episode_iii: revenge of the_sith, the_first_pg-13_film in the_franchise, was released on may 19, 2005.the_first_two_movies were met with mixed_reviews, with the third being received somewhat more positively.the prequel
trilogy begins 32 years before episode_iv and follows the_jedi_training of anakin_skywalker, luke's_father, and jedi_eventual_fall from grace and transformation into the_sith_lord_darth_vader, as well as the_corruption of the_galactic_republic and rise of the_empire led by darth_sidious.
together with the_original_trilogy, lucas has collectively referred to the_first_six_episodic_films of the_franchise as "the_tragedy of darth_vader".trilogy ====
prior to releasing the_original_film, and made possible by the_original_film success, lucas planned "three_trilogies of nine_films.
"he announced this to time in 1978, and confirmed that he had outlined three_trilogies of nine_films in 1981.
at various_stages of development, the_sequel_trilogy was to focus on the_rebuilding of the_republic, the return of luke in a_role similar to that of obi-wan in the_original_trilogy, luke's sister (not yet determined to be leia), han, leia, r2-d2 and c-3po.however, after beginning work on the_prequel_trilogy, lucas insisted that star_wars was meant to be a_six-part_series and that there would be no_sequel_trilogy.
lucas decided to leave the_franchise in the_hands of other_filmmakers, announcing in january 2012 that lucas would make no_more_star_wars_films.
in october of that_year, the_walt_disney_company agreed to buy lucasfilm and announced that episode_vii would be released in 2015.the_co-chairman of lucasfilm, kathleen_kennedy, became president of the_walt_disney_company and served as executive_producer of new_star_wars_feature_films.
lucas provided kennedy_kennedy_story_treatments for the_sequels during the_2012_sale, but in 2015 it was revealed lucas's sequel outline had been discarded.the_prequel
trilogy also meant the_end of the_existing_star_wars_expanded_universe, which was discarded from canon to give "maximum_creative_freedom to the_filmmakers and also preserve an_element of surprise and discovery for the_audience.

the_last_jedi on december 13, 2017, and episode_ix:

the_prequel trilogy starts 30 years after episode_vi and focuses on the_journey of the_force-sensitive_orphan_rey, guided by luke_skywalker.
along with ex-stormtrooper_finn and ace_x-wing_pilot_poe_dameron, rey helps the_resistance, led by leia, fight the_first_order, commanded by han and leia's son (and luke's_nephew), kylo_ren.
anthology_films ===
lucasfilm and kennedy have stated that the_standalone_films would be referred to as the_star_wars_anthology_series (though the_word_anthology has not been used in any of the_titles, instead carrying the_promotional_a_star_wars_story" subtitle).focused on how the_rebels obtained the death star plans introduced in the_1977_film, the_first_anthology_film, rogue one: a_star_wars_story, was released on december 16, 2016, to favorable_reviews_and_box_office_success.

lucasfilm maintained internal_continuity between the_films and television_content and the_eu_material until april 25, 2014, when lucasfilm announced all of the_eu_works would cease production.

video_games ===
the_star_wars_franchise has spawned over_one_hundred_computer, video, and board_games, dating back to some of the_earliest_home_consoles.
some are based directly on the_movie_material, while others rely heavily on the_non-canonical_expanded_universe (rebranded as star_wars_legends and removed from the_canon in 2014).star_wars_games have gone through three_significant_development_eras, marked by a_change in leadership among the_developers: the_early_licensed_games, those developed after the_creation of lucasarts, and those created after the_closure of the_lucasfilm_division by disney and the_transfer of the_license to electronic_arts.

"historical
influences ===
political_science has been an_important_element of star_wars since the_franchise launched in 1977, focusing on a_struggle between democracy and dictatorship.
battles featuring the_ewoks and gungans against the_empire_and_trade_federation, respectively, represent the_clash between a_primitive_society and a more advanced one, similar to the_vietnam-american_war.
darth_vader's_design was initially inspired by samurai_armor, and also incorporated a_german_military_helmet.
originally, lucas conceived of the_sith as a_group that served the_emperor in the_same_way that the_schutzstaffel served adolf_hitler; this was condensed into one_character in the_form of darth_vader's.
stormtroopers borrow the_name of world_war_i_german_"shock"_troopers.
imperial_officers wear uniforms resembling those of german_forces during world_war_ii, and political_and_security_officers resemble the_black-clad_ss down to the_stylized_silver_death's_head on the_black-clad_ss caps.
world_war_ii_terms were used for names in the_films; e.g._the_planets kessel (a_term that refers to a_group of encircled_forces) and hoth (after a_german_general who served on the_snow-laden_eastern_front).shots of the_commanders looking through at-at walker viewscreens in the empire strikes back resemble tank_interiors, and space_battles in the_original_film were based on world_war_i and world_war_ii dogfights.
palpatine being a_chancellor before becoming the_emperor in the_prequeltrilogy alludes to hitler's_role before appointing himself führer.
lucas has also drawn parallels to historical_dictators such as julius_caesar, napoleon_bonaparte, and politicians like richard_nixon.
the_great_jedi_purge_mirrors the_events of the_night of the_long_knives.
the_corruption of the_galactic_republic is modeled after the_fall of the_democratic_roman_republic and the_formation of the_empire.
on the_inspiration for the_first_order formed "from the_ashes of the_empire", the_force_awakensdirector_j._j._abrams spoke of conversations the_writers had about how the_nazis could have escaped to argentina after wwii and "started working together again.
the_star_wars_saga has had a_significant_impact on popular_culture, with references to the_star_wars_saga fictional universe deeply embedded in everyday_life.
phrases like "evil empire" andmay
the_force be with you
have become part of the_popular_lexicon.
the_first_star_wars_film in 1977 was a_cultural_unifier, enjoyed by a_wide_spectrum of people.
the_first_star_wars_film can be said to have helped launch the_science-fiction_boom of the_late_1970s and early_1980s, making science-fiction_films a mainstream genre.
the_widespread_impact made the_first_star_wars film a_prime_target for parody_works and homages, with popular_examples including hardware_wars, spaceballs, the_family_guy_trilogy and robot_chicken: star_wars.
in 1989, the_library of congress selected the_original_star_wars_film for preservation in the_u.s._national_film_registry, as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.

were the_versions initially presented for preservation because of the_difficulty of transferring from the_original_prints, but it was later revealed that the_library of congress possesses a_copyright_deposit_print of the_original_theatrical_releases.
industry ===
the_first_star_wars_film was a_huge_success for 20th_century_fox, and was credited for reinvigorating the_company.
within three_weeks of the_first_star_wars_film's_release, the_studio's_stock_price doubled to a_record_high.
prior to 1977, 20th_century_fox's_greatest_annual_profits were $37 million, while in 1977, the_company broke that_record by posting a_profit of $79 million.
the_franchise helped 20th_century_fox to change from an_almost_bankrupt_production_company to a_thriving_media_conglomerate.
star_wars fundamentally changed the_aesthetics and narratives of hollywood_films, switching the_focus of hollywood-made_films from deep,_meaningful_stories based on dramatic_conflict, themes and irony to sprawling_special-effects-laden_blockbusters, as well as changing the_hollywood_film_industry in fundamental_ways.
before star_wars, special_effects in films had not appreciably advanced since the 1950s.
the_commercial_success of star_wars created a_boom in state-of-the-art special effects in the_late_1970s.
along with jaws, star_wars started the_tradition of the_summer_blockbuster_film in the_entertainment_industry, where films open on many_screens at the_same_time and profitable_franchises are important.
star_wars created the_model for the_major_film_trilogy and showed that merchandising_rights on a_film could generate more_money than a_film did.
film_critic_roger_ebert wrote in film_critic_roger_ebert book the_great_movies, "like the_birth of a_nation_and_citizen_kane, star_wars was a_technical_watershed that influenced many of the_movies that came after.
it began a_new_generation of special_effects and high-energy_motion_pictures.
a_film was one of the_first_films to link genres together to invent a_new,_high-concept_genre for filmmakers to build upon.
finally, along with steven_spielberg's_jaws, a_film shifted the_film_industry's_focus away from personal_filmmaking of the_late_1970s and towards fast-paced,_big-budget_blockbusters for younger_audiences.
some_critics have blamed star_wars and jaws for ruining" hollywood by shifting hollywood focus from "sophisticated"_films such as the_godfather, taxi_driver, and annie_hall to films about spectacle and juvenile_fantasy, and for the_industry_shift from stand-alone, one and done films, towards blockbuster_franchises with multiple_sequels and prequels.
one_such_critic, peter_biskind, complained, "when all was said and done, lucas and steven_spielberg's returned the_1970s_audience, grown sophisticated on a_diet of european_and_new_hollywood_films, to the_simplicities of the_pre-1960s_golden_age of movies...
they marched backward through the_looking-glass.
in an_opposing_view, tom_shone wrote that through star_wars and jaws, lucas and spielberg didn't betray cinema at all: lucas and spielberg plugged it back into the_grid, returning the_medium to it roots as a_carnival_sideshow, a_magic_act, one_big_special_effect", which was "a_kind of rebirth".
the_original_star_wars_trilogy is widely considered one of the_best_film trilogies in history.
numerous_filmmakers have been influenced by star_wars, including damon_lindelof, dean_devlin, roland_emmerich, john_lasseter, david_fincher, joss_whedon, john_singleton, kevin_smith, and later star_wars directors j. j. abrams and gareth_edwards.
lucas's_concept of a_"used_universe" particularly influenced ridley_scott's_blade_runner (1982) and alien (1979), james cameron's aliens (1986) as well as the_terminator (1984), george_miller's_mad_max 2 (1981), and peter_jackson's_the_lord of the_rings_trilogy (2001–2003).christopher_nolan cited star_wars as an_influence when making the_2010_blockbuster_film inception.
fan works ====
the_star_wars_saga has inspired many_fans to create many_fans own non-canon_material set in the_star_wars_galaxy.
in recent_years, this has ranged from writing fan_fiction to creating fan_films.
in 2002, lucasfilm sponsored the first annual official star wars fan film awards, officially recognizing filmmakers and the_genre.
because of concerns over potential_copyright and trademark_issues, however, the_contest was initially open only to parodies, mockumentaries, and documentaries.
fan_fiction_films set in the_star_wars_universe were originally ineligible, but in 2007, lucasfilm changed the_submission_standards to allow in-universe fiction entries.
lucasfilm has allowed but not endorsed the_creation of fan_fiction, as long as lucasfilm does not attempt to make a_profit.
academia ===
as the_characters and the_storyline of the_original_trilogy are so well known, educators have used fan_fiction_films set in the_star_wars_universe in the_classroom as a_learning_resource.
for example, a_project in western_australia honed elementary_school_students storytelling skills by role-playing_action_scenes from the_movies and later creating props and audio/visual_scenery to enhance the_movies performance.
others have used fan_fiction_films set in the_star_wars_universe to encourage second-level_students to integrate technology in the_science_classroom by making prototype_lightsabers.
similarly, psychiatrists in new_zealand and the_us have advocated psychiatrists in new_zealand and the_us use in the_university_classroom to explain different_types of psychopathology.== see also ====

instead, the_release of the_star_wars_prequel_films, in which the_hero was also named anakin dies in battle at the_conclusion of the_novel.
even after the_release of the_star_wars_prequel_films, in which the_hero was also named anakin , anakin_solo has been mentioned several times in most_following_novels, including a_possible_appearance in traitor by matthew_stover, as a_droid in betrayal by aaron_allston as anakin_sal-solo, and in backlash, where the_release of the_star_wars_prequel_films, in which the_hero was also named anakin appeared to the_release of the_star_wars_prequel_films, in which the_hero was also named anakin maternal uncle luke skywalker and to luke's_son, ben_skywalker by aaron_allston.
anakin is portrayed in the_earlier_books as being a_genius and a_loner, but is haunted by anakin name.
in lyric's_world, it is revealed that anakin loves to take computers apart and put computers back together and sees it as a_puzzle.
anakin would also have dreams of emperor_palpatine and darth_vader trying to persuade anakin to fall to the_dark_side of the_force; anakin overcomes this_fear in anakin's quest, in which anakin confronts anakin.

leia_organa is a_fictional_character in the_star_wars_franchise, portrayed in films by carrie_fisher.
introduced in the_original_star_wars_film in 1977, leia is princess of the_planet_alderaan, a_member of the_imperial_senate and an_agent of the_rebel_alliance.
leia thwarts the_sinister_sith_lord_darth_vader and helps bring about the_destruction of the_empire's_cataclysmic_superweapon, the_death_star.
in the empire strikes back (1980), leia commands a_rebel_base and evades the_sinister_sith_lord_darth_vader as leia falls in love with the_smuggler_han_solo.
in return of the_jedi (1983), leia helps in the_operation to rescue han from the_crime lord_jabba the_hutt, and is revealed to be vader's_daughter and the_twin_sister of luke_skywalker.
the_prequel_film revenge of the_sith (2005) establishes that the_twins'_mother is senator (and former_queen)
padmé_amidala of naboo, who dies after childbirth, while padmé_amidala of naboo, who dies after childbirth, while their_father is none other than former_jedi_knight_anakin_skywalker, who would become darth_vader_father is none other than former_jedi_knight_anakin_skywalker, who would become darth_vader.
leia is adopted by senator_bail and queen breha_organa of alderaan.
in the_sequel_trilogy, leia is the_founder and general of the_resistance against the_first_order.
leia and han have a_son named ben solo, who adopted the_name kylo_ren after turning to the_dark_side of the_force and became the_lead_enforcer for the_first_order.
in the_rise of skywalker (2019), it is revealed that leia was briefly trained as a_jedi by leia brother sometime after return of jedi.
in the_film, leia is the_mentor of rey, the_last_remaining_jedi.
leia dies towards the_end of the_film, but returns in the_epilogue_scene as a_force_ghost alongside luke.
one of the_more_popular_star_wars_characters, leia has been called a 1980s icon, a_feminist_hero and model for other_adventure_heroines.
leia has appeared in many_derivative_works and merchandising, including the_now-noncanonical_star_wars expanded_universe, and has been referenced or parodied in several_tv_shows and films.
leia_'cinnamon_bun'_hairstyle from star_wars (1977) and metal_bikini from return of the_jedi have become cultural_icons.
fisher was nominated for the_saturn_award for best_actress twice for a_new_hope and return of the_jedi.
fisher later received two_saturn_award_nominations for best_supporting_actress, the first for the force awakens and the second being a_posthumous_nomination for the_jedi.
creation and casting ==
leia was created by star_wars_creator_george_lucas, who in 1999 explained his_early_development of the_main_characters:the_first_[version] talked about a_princess and an_old_general.
the_first_[version] involved a_father, his_son, and his_daughter; his_daughter was the_heroine of the_film.
now his_daughter has become luke, mark_hamill's_character.
there was also the_story of two_brothers where i transformed one of luke, mark_hamill's_character into a_sister.
the_older_brother was imprisoned, and a_sister had to rescue the_older_brother and bring the_older_brother back to luke, mark_hamill's_character_dad.
in the_rough_draft of star_wars, leia is the_spoiled_teenage_daughter of king_kayos and queen_breha of aquilae, with two_brothers, biggs and windy; biggs returned to the_rough_draft of star_wars as a_childhood_friend of luke.
leia was at one_point "the_daughter of owen_lars and owen_lars wife beru ...
luke's_cousin–together they visit the_grave of luke's_cousin mother, who perished with luke's_cousin father on a_planet destroyed by the_death_star.
a_later_story_synopsis establishes leia as leia antilles", the_daughter of bail_antilles from the_peaceful_world of organa_major.
in the_fourth_draft it was established that "leia_organa" came instead from alderaan.
fisher was 19 when fisher was cast as princess_leia, with actresses including amy_irving, cindy_williams and jodie_foster also up for the_role.
in 2014, inktank reported that the_extended_list of "more_than_two_dozen_actresses" who had auditioned for princess_leia included glenn_close, farrah_fawcett, jessica_lange, sissy_spacek, sigourney_weaver, cybill_shepherd, jane_seymour, anjelica_huston, kim_basinger, kathleen_turner, geena_davis, meryl_streep, and terri_nunn.
asked about streep in 2015, fisher said, "i've never heard that one.
but jodie_foster was up for that one...
amy_irving and jodie.
and i got it."
on leia's_'cinnamon_bun'_hairstyle, george_lucas stated that "in the_1977_film, i was working very hard to create something different that wasn't fashion, so i went with a_kind of southwestern_pancho_villa_woman_revolutionary_look. ...
the_buns are basically from turn-of-the-century mexico.
"lucas later noted that leia's_mother, padmé_amidala, wears a_similar-looking_hopi_hairstyle in revenge of the_sith.
a_photo depicting famous_mexican_revolutionary_clara_de_la_rocha wearing a_similar_hairstyle exists in the_lucas_museum of narrative_art_archives.
in 2015, mental_floss cited research suggesting that while female_mexican_revolutionaries did not have such_elaborate_hairstyles, young_marriageable_hopi_women did, and young_marriageable_hopi_women "squash blossom
whorls" superficially resemble leia's_hair_buns.
leia's_hairstyle may have also been inspired by that of queen_fria in the_1939_flash_gordon_comic_strip "the_ice_kingdom of mongo", and scientist_barnes_wallis'_wife_molly (played by ursula_jeans) in the_1955_war_film the_dam_busters.
comparisons have also been made to the_4th-century-bc_iberian_sculpture_lady of elche, as_well_as_the_1920s_"earphones"_hairstyle.
composer_john_williams created a_musical_leitmotif for leia which recurs throughout the_star_wars_saga. "
princess_leia's_theme" was recorded as a_concert_suite (4:18_length) for the_score of the_1955_war_film the_dam_busters.
the_second_draft of the_return of the_jedi_screenplay contained dialogue in which obi-wan tells luke obi-wan has a_twin_sister.
she and their_mother were "sent to the_protection of friends in a distant system.their_mother died shortly thereafter, and luke's_sister was adopted by ben's_friends, the_governor of alderaan and alderaan wife.
"fisher explained in 1983: "leia's_real_father left leia's_real_father when their_mother was pregnant, so their_mother married this_king_organa.
i was adopted and grew up set apart from other_people because i was a_princess.
"character =
anthony_breznican of entertainment_weekly describes leia as a_"diplomat,_spy,_warrior,_undercover_agent".
mark_edlitz calls their_mother "a smart, feisty, brave diplomat and warrior" in the_huffington_post.
fisher told rolling_stone in 1983:
there are a_lot of people who don't like my_character in these_movies; these_movies think i'm some_kind of space
bitch.their mother has no_friends, no_family; their_mother_planet was blown up in seconds ...
so all_their_mother has is a_cause.
from the_first_film [star_wars], she was just_a_soldier, front_line and center.
the_only_way they knew to make the_character strong was to make she angry.
in return of the_jedi, she gets to be more feminine, more supportive, more_affectionate.she said in 2014:i would rather have played han_solo.
when i first read the_script i thought that's the_part to be, always wry and sardonic.
he's always that.
i feel like a_lot of the_timeleia's either worried or pissed or, thank god, sort of snarky.
but i'm much more worried and pissed than han_solo ever was, and those aren't fun things to play ...
i had a_lot of fun killing jabba the_hutt.a_lot of fun killing jabba the_hutt asked me on the_day if i wanted to havea stunt
double kill jabba the_hutt.
that's the_best_time i ever had as an_actor.
and the_only_reason to go into acting is if you can kill a_giant_monster.

skywalker_saga ===
original_trilogy ====
a_new_hope =====
introduced in the_original_1977_film star_wars, princess_leia_organa of alderaan is a_member of the_imperial_senate.
princess_leia_organa of alderaan is captured by darth_vader (portrayed by david_prowse, voiced by james_earl_jones) on board the_ship tantive_iv, where princess_leia_organa of alderaan is acting as a_spy for the_rebel_alliance.
leia has secretly hidden the_blueprints for the_death_star, the_empire's_moon-sized_battle_station, inside the_astromech_droid r2-d2_(kenny_baker) and has sent the_astromech_droid r2-d2_(kenny_baker to find one of the_last_remaining_jedi, obi-wan_kenobi (alec_guinness), on the_nearby_planet of tatooine.
vader arrests leia and has leia tortured, but leia resists revealing anything.
death_star_commander_grand_moff_tarkin (peter_cushing) threatens to destroy death_star_commander_grand_moff_tarkin (peter_cushing)
home_planet_alderaan with the_death_star unless death_star_commander_grand_moff_tarkin (peter_cushing) reveals the_location of the_hidden_rebel_base.
leia provides the_location of an_old,_abandoned_base on the_planet_dantooine, but death_star_commander_grand_moff_tarkin (peter_cushing) orders her_home_planet_alderaan to be destroyed anyway.
leia is rescued by luke_skywalker (mark_hamill) and han_solo (harrison_ford), and they escape aboard han's_ship, the_millennium_falcon.
after analyzing the_death_star's_schematics, the_rebels find a_tiny_weakness in the_battle_station, which luke uses to destroy it in luke x-wing fighter.
in the_aftermath of the_victory, leia bestows medals on the_heroes at the_hidden_rebel_base on yavin 4.alyssa_rosenberg of the_washington_post writes of leia in the_film:leia's nerves as a_revolutionary are clear from the_moment leia arrives on screen ...
leia takes shots at the_storm_troopers boarding leia ship, gets stunned with a_blaster in leia hand, then has the_audacity to try to make darth_vader feel ashamed of himself ...
leia has enough_energy left over after a_nasty_session of torture to insult grand_moff_tarkin.
and while leia grieves when leia home planet, alderaan, is destroyed by the_death_star, leia's not paralyzed: when leia unexpected rescuers show up, leia’s ready to go, and to gripe about her_unexpected_rescuers operational_sloppiness.
rosenberg also notes that, though han is almost immediately attracted to leia, han conflict because han insists on asserting command and rosenberg automatically resists, even as han proves han to be worthy of it.
and despite han_initial_disdain for the_smuggler, whom han sees as selfish, leia later acknowledges "i knew there was more to you than money" when han comes through for the_rebellion.
fisher told rolling_stone in 1980 that in the_original_script, when luke and han come to rescue a_captured_leia, "i was hanging upside down with yellow_eyes, like in the_exorcist ...
some_form of radar_torture was done to meand
i was in a_beam, bruised and beaten up, suspended in midair.
the_reason it was cut from the_film was because i was unconscious and the_wookiee would have had to carry me for, like, the_next_fifteen_minutes.
the_empire strikes back
in the empire strikes back (1980), leia is at the_rebel_base on hoth.
leia leads its_evacuation during an_imperial_attack, and then flees with han, chewbacca (peter_mayhew) and c-3po (anthony_daniels) on the_millennium_falcon.
han, chewbacca (peter_mayhew) and c-3po
(anthony daniels) dodge pursuing imperial_tie_fighters by flying into an_asteroid_field when the_millennium_falcon's_hyperdrive breaks down, with leia piloting the_ship at one_point.
romance blossoms between leia and han during leia and han flight from the_empire; while hiding in the_stomach of a_space_slug, leia and han finally share a_kiss.
with the_ship needing repairs, han seeks out his_old_friend lando_calrissian(billy dee_williams) in cloud_city, the_floating_city over bespin.
though he welcomes them graciously, lando soon turns them over to a_newly_arrived_darth_vader, who hopes to use them as bait to capture luke.
leia confesses leia love for han as lando is frozen in carbonite and then handed over to bounty_hunter_boba_fett (jeremy_bulloch), who is charged with bringing lando to the_crime lord_jabba the_hutt.
lando helps leia, chewbacca and the two droids escape.
leia senses that luke is in trouble, and goes back to save luke after luke is nearly killed during a_lightsaber_duel and confrontation with vader.
rosenberg notes:
yes, it's slightly ridiculous ... that [han] tries to pry a_confession of affection out of han on hoth, as leia is trying to manage an_evacuation with just_an_ion_cannon for defense.
but han's not wrong that if leia doesn't figure out that leia's a person with needs, leia's going to burn out ...
in a_way, it's an_early_confession of love:
han’s anxious about the_bounty_hunters who are still pursuing luke ...
but luke would stay and give luke love and support to leia if leia could just acknowledge that leia needs luke.
return of the_jedi =====
in return of the_jedi (1983), leia infiltrates jabba the_hutt's_palace on tatooine disguised as the_ubese_bounty_hunter_boushh, and brings a_captive_chewbacca with a_captive_chewbacca as part of the ruse.a_captive_chewbacca frees han from the_carbonite, but han are recaptured by jabba.
leia is now chained to jabba as leia slave, outfitted in a_metal_bikini.
after luke arrives and kills jabba's_rancor, jabba sentences luke, han and chewbacca to be fed to the_sarlacc.
lando (disguised as a_guard) helps them overpower them captors, and leia seizes the_moment to strangle jabba with leia chain.
luke and leia swing to safety, blowing up jabba's_barge behind luke and leia.
later, the_heroes go to the_forest_moon of endor to prepare for a_battle with the_empire.
there, luke reveals to leia that luke is luke twin sister and that vader is their_father.
leia joins han in leading the_rebels in battle with imperial_troops as the_rebel_fleet attacks the_second_death_star.
leia is slightly injured, but the_rebels, with help from the_ewoks, ultimately defeat the_forces of the_empire, with the_second_death_star destroyed once more.
fisher told rolling_stone in 1983, "in return of the_jedi, [leia] gets to be more feminine, more supportive, more affectionate.
but let's not forget that these_movies are basically boys'_fantasies.
so the other way these_movies are basically boys'_fantasies made leia more female in this_one was to have leia take off leia clothes.
"rosenberg
writes of han and leia:
and we know those_two_crazy_kids are locked for life in return of the_jedi the_jedi when it turns out that han has accepted a_generalship in the_rebellion, keeping it a secret from leia.
in a_new_hope, leia was grumbling about the_quality of han as a_rescuer ...
but when leia finds out what han's done, accepting a_rank a_rank once found insulting and a mission leia knows to be dangerous, leia is the_first_person to volunteer to join a_rank strike team.
in star_wars, that's what love looks like:
trusting your_partner’s commitment to the_cause and respecting your_partner strategic and technical judgement.
in the_film, leia says that leia has vague_memories of leia real mother, who leia describes as "kind... but sad".
bouzereau quoted lucas in 1997:the_part that i never really developed is the_death of luke and leia's_mother.
i had a_backstory for leia's_mother in earlier_drafts, but a_backstory for her basically didn't survive.
when i got to jedi, i wanted one of the_kids to have some_kind of memory of leia's_mother because leia's_mother will be a_key_figure in the new episodesi'm writing.
but i really debated whether or not leia should remember her.trilogy ====
revenge of the_sith =====
in the_prequel film_revenge of the_sith (2005), padmé_amidala (natalie_portman) is pregnant with anakin_skywalker's_(hayden_christensen)_twins near the_end of the_clone_wars.
after anakin turns to the_dark_side of the_force and becomes darth_vader, padmé gives birth to luke and leia on polis_massa and then dies.
leia is adopted by senator_bail_organa (jimmy_smits) and his_wife queen_breha (rebecca_jackson_mendoza) of alderaan.
film_critic_peter_travers of rolling_stone wrote, "as we watch anakin nearly melt in the_lava, only to be put together, frankenstein_style, in a_lab while lucas_intercuts_scenes of padme giving birth to the_twins luke and leia, a_link to genuine_feeling is established at last.
"trilogy ====
the_force awakens ====
in march 2013, fisher confirmed that fisher would reprise fisher role as leia in star_wars:the_force awakens.
set 30 years after return of the_jedi, the force awakens reintroduces a_leia who is "a_little_more_battle weary,
a little more broken hearted".
in november 2015, director_j._j._abrams said of leia, "leia's referred to as general but
there's a_moment in the_movie where a character sort of slips and calls leia 'leia.'
commenting on the_story he added, the_stakes are pretty high in the_story for leia, so there's not much goofing around where leia's concerned.
asked how leia is handling things in the_film, fisher said, not easily ...
[leia is] solitary.
under a_lot of pressure.
committed as ever to leia cause, but i would imagine feeling somewhat defeated, tired, and pissed.
in
the_film, leia is the_leader of the_resistance, a_group formed by the_new_republic to fight a_proxy_war with the_first_order (a_group formed by the_remnants of the_empire) and trying to find luke, who disappeared years earlier.
when leia forces foil a_first_order_attack searching for the_resistance_astromech_droid bb-8, leia is reunited with han, who has helped the_renegade_stormtrooper finn (john_boyega) and orphaned_scavenger_rey (daisy_ridley) bring the_droid this far.
han and leia have been estranged for many_years; han and leia marriage fell apart after han and leia son, ben_solo (adam_driver), fell to the_dark_side and became the_first_order_commander_kylo_ren.
leia believes ben can still be brought back to the_dark_side.
han_volunteers for a_mission to infiltrate the_first_order's_starkiller_base to disable the_first_order's_starkiller_base defensive shields.
confronting the_first_order_commander_kylo_ren, han tries to convince the_first_order_commander_kylo_ren son to leave the_first_order, but the_first_order_commander_kylo_ren instead impales his_son father on his_son lightsaber.
leia senses han's_death through the_force, and later shares a_moment of grief with rey, who had thought of han as a_mentor and father figure.
leia sees rey, chewbacca, and
r2-d2 off when they depart to locate luke, saying, may the_force be with you".
asked why leia is not shown to be a_jedi in the force awakens (as leia is in the_star_wars expanded universe works), abrams told ign, "it was a_great_question, and one that we talked about quite_a_bit, even with carrie_[fisher].
why did she not take advantage of this_natural_force_strength that this_character had.
and one of the_answers was that it was simply a_choice that she made, that she decision to run the_rebellion, and ultimately this resistance, and consider she a general, as opposed to a_jedi.
it was simply a_choice that she took".took" also added, "i would like to think that there really isn't much of a_ticking_clock, and it's never too late ...
clearly we've seen, and we do again, that she still is force strong.
and it's something that i think is an_intrinsic_piece of she_character.
fisher was nominated for a_2016_saturn_award for best_supporting_actress for fisher portrayal.
the_last_jedi =====
in december 2015, producer_kathleen_kennedy confirmed that fisher would reprise the_role of leia in the_next_installment, then known as star_wars:
episode_viii, but later named star_wars: the_last_jedi.
fisher died on december 27, 2016, after going into cardiac_arrest.
it was confirmed that she had completed filming she_role in the_film shortly before she death.
in the_film, she is among those on the_bridge of she flagship, the_raddus, who are expelled into space when the_ship is attacked by
the_first_order.she uses the_force to pull she back to the_ship.
after recovering, she shoots and stuns resistance_pilot_poe_dameron (oscar_isaac), who has mutinied against she_successor, vice_admiral_holdo
(laura dern).from his_solitude on ahch-to, luke projects luke through the_force to the_resistance_stronghold on crait and reunites with she, apologizing for what happened to ben.she replies that she knows she son is gone, but luke reassures she that "no_one's ever really
while luke distracts kylo and kylo attacking first_order_troops, she is among the_remaining_resistance_forces who escape from crait in the_millennium_falcon.
the_rise of skywalker =====
following fisher's_death, variety reported that fisher was slated to appear in star_wars:
the_rise of skywalker and speculated that lucasfilm would need to find a_way to address skywalker and what would become of skywalker character.
filming began on august 1, 2018.
lucasfilm announced in january 2017 that lucasfilm had "no_plans to digitally recreate carrie_fisher's_performance as princess or general leia_organa".
in april 2017, carrie_fisher's's_family granted disney and lucasfilm the_rights to use recent_footage of the_late_actress in the_rise of skywalker.
however, kennedy subsequently said that carrie_fisher's would not appear in the_film.
in july 2018, it was announced that carrie_fisher's would appear as leia in the_rise of skywalker, using unseen_footage from the force awakens.
initially, there had also been plans to use additional_unseen_footage of leia from the_last_jedi, but it was ultimately not included in the_film.
carrie_fisher's's_daughter billie_lourd, who portrayed lieutenant_connix in all_three_sequel_trilogy_films, also stepped in as leia for a_brief_flashback in the_film in which leia face was digitally replaced by carrie_fisher's's_likeness, using imagery from return of the_last_jedi.
in the_film, leia continues to lead the_resistance while offering guidance and support to rey as leia continues leia training to become a_the_last_jedi.

leia passes away, making rey experience overwhelming_guilt.
rey heals ren's_wound using the_force.
after the_battle of exegol, a_redeemed_ben_solo sacrifices the_remainder of ben_solo_life_force to resurrect a_dead_rey, and ben_solo vanishes at the_same_time as leia becomes one with the_force.
rey then returns to the_lars_homestead on tatooine and buries the_lightsabers that had belonged to leia and leia father, anakin_skywalker as the_spirits of luke and leia look on with pride, with rey honoring them by adopting the_surname "skywalker".

rogue one:
a_star_wars_story ====
leia makes a_brief_appearance in the_final_scene of the_2016_film rogue_one, receiving the_plans for the_death_star as a_lead-up to the_beginning of a_new_hope.
since this_movie takes place prior to the_original_star_wars_trilogy, a_very_young_leia was required.
to achieve that_effect, a_computer-generated_image of a_young_carrie_fisher was superimposed over norwegian_actress_ingvild_deila's_face;
archival_audio of carrie_fisher saying "hope" was used to voice the_character.

we thought we had an_opportunity to show leia learning to be a_leader, experimenting with the_personality that becomes the_stronger_more_resolute_character you see in a_new_hope.
one of the_complex_challenges of depicting leia in star_wars_rebels ===
is that we have to remind the_audience that at this_point leia is part of the_empire.
leia doesn't believe in the_empire, but leia is acting the_part, almost_a_double_agent.

in those_days, there was no_such_thing as a_"likeness" ...
there was no_merchandising tied to movies.

not that i don't think i’m cute or anything, but when i looked in the_mirror, i didn't think i was signing away anything of value.
lately i feel like iminnie mouse—
the_identity of princess_leiaso eclipses any_other_identity that i’ve ever had.

cinnamon_buns_hairstyle ===
leia's_unique_hairdo in 1977's_a_new_hope has come to be known as the_"doughnut"_or_"cinnamon_buns"_hairstyle, and is iconic of the_character and series.
a_february_1978_cover_story for the_british_teen_magazine jackie included step-by-step instructions on how to replicate leia's_hair_buns.
in the_1978_short_film_parody_hardware_wars, princess_anne-droid has actual_cinnamon_buns on the_side of princess_anne-droid head.

spaceballs, princess_vespa (daphne_zuniga) appears to have the_hairstyle, which is soon revealed toin_fact be a_large_pair of headphones.

lourd also has a_cameo in the force awakens (2015) in which lourd wears leia's_distinctive_hair_buns.
feminist_analysis ===
leia has been the_subject of feminist_analysis.
mark_edlitz wrote for the_huffington_post in 2010 that "leia is an_exemplary_personification of female_empowerment.
bushman, television_curator at the_paley_center for media, said in 2012, "from the_male_perspective ...
leia was a_very_creditable_character for leia time—not perfect, but certainly defiant, assertive, and strong.
rosenberg of the_washington_post wrote in 2015, "leia wasn't just_the_first_great_heroine of science_fiction and fantasy to capture my_imagination.
leia was one of the_first_characters i encountered whose_power came from leia political conviction and acumen.
in her_2007_article feminism and the_force: empowerment and disillusionment in a_galaxy far, far away", diana_dominguez cited leia as a_welcome_change from the_previous_portrayals of women in film and tv.she wrote:here was a_woman who could play like and with the_boys, but who didn't have to become one of the_boys and who could, if and when diana_dominguez wanted to, show diana_dominguez liked the_boys, a_woman who is outspoken, unashamed, and, most importantly, unpunished for being so.
diana_dominguez isn't a_flirty_sex-pot, tossing diana_dominguez hair around seductively to distract the_enemy ...
diana_dominguez doesn't play the_role of "maternal_caretaker", although diana_dominguez does display caring and compassion, or "the_sweet_innocent_damsel" who stands passively by while the_men do all_the_work, but does step aside to let the_men do what the_men're
good at when it is wise to do so ...
leia is a_hero without losing leia gendered status; leia does not have to play the_cute,_helpless_sex_kitten or become sexless and androgynous to get what leia wants.
leia can be strong, sassy, outspoken, bossy, and bitchy, and still be respected and seen as feminine.
rosenberg writes that, though at first_luke is an apolitical innocent in search of adventure and han is a_detached_opportunist in search of money, both are "influenced by leia's_passion [and] take both_places as full_participants in the_rebellion".
leia notes, "everyone else eventually comes around to leia's view of the_world.
"leia herself, singularly dedicated to leia political movement against the_empire, "finds a_partner in han, acknowledging that personal_happiness can help leia sustain leia commitment to building a_better_galactic_order".
rosenberg cites "leia's_willingness to see the best in rosenberg, and han's_desire to live up to han_belief in rosenberg" as a_foundation of their_relationship, also pointing out rosenberg attempts to make han recognize that han has needs like anyone else and should acknowledge that han needs rosenberg.
in their_2012_essay "lightsabers, political_arenas, and marriages", ray_merlock and kathy_merlock_jackson cite leia as the_successor of earlier_science_fiction_heroines wilma_deering of buck_rogers and dale_arden of flash_gordon, and the_embodiment of "a_new_stage in the_ongoing_presentation of the_fairy-tale_princess in jeopardy".
writing that "after leia, no longer would princesses be passive and salvaged simply with a_kiss," princesses note the_reflection of the_character in later_disney_princess_animated_films and in woman_warriors such as ellen_ripley from the_alien_franchise and xena of the_adventure_tv_series xena:
warrior_princess.
a._o._scott of the_new_york_times described leia as "a_foremother of hermione_granger and katniss_everdeen and of countless_latter-day_disney_princesses.
warrior_princess also foretold the_recent,_somewhat_belated_feminist_turn in the_star_wars
cyclemark hamill described fisher's_performance as:
warrior_princess was effortlessly feminist, you know?she wasn't some_shrinking_violet that needed a_guy to come rescue warrior_princess.
in fact, warrior_princess made han and luke look like chumps.
warrior_princess was anything but what i expected.
i mean, i sort of thought
, "well, she's 19, that's barely out of high_school.
in many_ways, she was a lot older and wiser than i was.
fisher herself described leia as a_"huge"_feminist_icon, dismissing the_suggestion that the_character was ever a_"damsel in distress".
fisher said of leia, "fisher bossed them around.
i don't know what your_idea of distress is, but that wasn't it!and
i wasn't some_babe running through the_galaxy with my_tits bouncing around.
so i wasn't threatening to women".women" added, "i like leia.
i like how women" was feisty.
i like how she killed jabba the_hutt".

leia's_slave_costume when she is held captive by jabba the_hutt at the_beginning of return of the_jedi—made of brass and dubbed leia's "metal bikini" or "gold bikini"—immediately made the_character (and fisher)_a_"generational_sex_symbol" celebrated by pin-up_posters, and later_merchandising and cosplay.
the_outfit has gained a cult following of the_outfit own.
rosenberg noted that "leia's_slave_costume has become culturally iconic in a_way that has slipped loose from the_context of the_scenes in which leia wore it and the things leia does after leia is forced into the_outfit.
"wired wrote in 2006, "
there's no_doubt that the_sight of carrie_fisher in the_gold_sci-fi_swimsuit was burned into the_sweaty_subconscious of a_generation of fanboys hitting puberty in the_spring of 1983.
acknowledging the_opinion of some that the_slave_leia"_iconography tarnishes the_character's_position as "feminist_hero", rosenberg argues:leia may be captive in these_scenes, but leia's not exactly_a_compliant_fantasy.
instead, leia's biding leia time for the_moment when leia can put that_fury into action, carrying out a_carefully_laid_plan to rescue leia lover.
and when that_moment comes, the_bikini doesn't condemn leia to passivity.
she rises, and uses the_very_chains that bind she to strangle the_creature who tried to take away she power by turning she into a_sex_object.
science_fiction_filmmaker_letia_clouston concurs, saying "sci-fi has had a_long_history of strong_female_characters.
yes, princess_leia was in a_gold_bikini, but princess_leia was also the one who single-handedly killed jabba.
when you take into account_movies and tv shows like terminator, aliens, battlestar_galactica, and even_video_games like metroid, you can see sci-fi has consistently promoted the_strength of women more than any_other_genre.

the_force awakens =====
in the force awakens, set approximately 30 years after return of the_jedi, han has returned to han old life as a_smuggler.
before the_events of the_film, han and chewbacca had lost the_millennium_falcon to thieves, but he and chewbacca reclaim the_millennium_falcon after the_millennium_falcon takes off from the_planet jakku, piloted by the_scavenger rey (daisy_ridley) and the_renegade_stormtrooper_finn_(john_boyega).as_mercenaries close in on them, han takes the_millennium_falcon into light_speed, and han get away.
when han learns that rey is looking for luke, who disappeared years before, he takes luke, who disappeared years before to he_old_friend maz_kanata (lupita_nyong'o), who can deliver the_droid bb-8 to the_resistance against the_tyrannical_first_order.
luke, who disappeared years before are forced to flee when first_order_troops descend upon luke, who disappeared years before.
han is impressed with rey's_piloting_skills, and offers han a_job on the_falcon, but han declines.
when rey is kidnapped by the_first_order, han sees han being carried off by first_order_commander_kylo_ren (adam_driver), whom han seems to recognize.
han and finn meet with the_resistance, which is led by leia, whom han has not seen in several_years.
it is then revealed that ren is actually han and finn son, ben_solo, who trained as a_jedi under luke.
however, ren was corrupted by the_first_order's_supreme_leader_snoke (andy_serkis), and turned to the_dark_side of the_force.
as kylo_ren, ren betrayed the_republic and destroyed a_jedi—much like ren grandfather, darth_vader, had done decades before.
heartbroken by ben's_betrayal, han and finn separated.
leia asks han to find ben and bring ben home, convinced that there is still good in ben.
han and finn go with finn to the_first_order's_superweapon, starkiller_base, to destroy the_base and rescue_rey.
there, ren sees ren walk onto the_bridge above the_reactor_chasm.
han follows ren onto the_bridge, and calls out to ren by ren real name.
han pleads with ren to abandon the_dark_side and come back with ren, warning ren that snoke will kill ren once ren has taken control of the_galaxy.
ren tells han that ren knows what ren should do, but that ren doesn't have the_strength to do it, and asks han to help ren.
han agrees.
after a_moment, ren ignites ren lightsaber, impaling and fatally wounding ren father.
han looks into han son's eyes and touches his_son face before falling off the_bridge to ren_death.
the_last_jedi =====
the_film briefly pays homage to han.
the_first_scene includes a_bomb which has "han says hi" written on it in an_alien_language.
later in the_film, luke asks where han is after reuniting with chewie.
during the_climax, luke hands han gold dice (though this turns out to be part of an_apparition).
the_rise of skywalker =====
han appears briefly in the_rise of skywalker.
after a_near-fatal_duel with rey and the_death of leia, ren experiences a_vision of han, who tells his_son that kylo ren is dead, but ben_solo is alive.
han urges ben_solo to do the_right_thing and come back to the_light_side.
in an_allusion to their_final_interaction, ren admits that ren knows what ren has to do but is not sure if ren has the_strength, while han encourages his_son and touches his_son face.
drawing his_son lightsaber, ren turns and throws his_lightsaber away, becoming ben_solo once again.
when ren turns around, han has vanished.
at the_end, chewbacca is given han's_medal from the_end of the_original_film.

a_star_wars_story ====
a_film featuring ben_solo before the_events of the_original_film was released on may 25, 2018, starring alden_ehrenreich.
in the_original_film, han_han is characterized to be an_orphan on the_planet_corellia.
han_and_han_lover, qi'ra (emilia_clarke)
, attempt to escape from a_criminal_gang and bribe an_imperial_officer with a_stolen_sample of coaxium, a_powerful_hyperspace_fuel, in exchange for passage on an_outgoing_transport, but qi'ra is apprehended before qi'ra can board.
han vows to return for han and joins the_imperial_navy as a_flight_cadet.
he is given the_surname_"solo" by the_recruiting_officer, apparently referencing han's_statement that he "has no_people".
three years later, han has been expelled from the_imperial_flight_academy for insubordination and gets transferred to the_imperial_army.
while serving as an_infantryman during a_battle on mimban, he encounters a_gang of criminals posing as imperial_soldiers led by tobias_beckett (woody harrelson).he tries to blackmail them into taking he with them, but tobias_beckett has he arrested for desertion and thrown into a_pit to be fed to a_beast – a_wookiee named chewbacca.

lando cheats to win but agrees to join the_mission in exchange for a_share of the_profits.
the_team_boards_lando cheats ship, the_millennium_falcon, and heads for kessel.
the_theft is a_success partly thanks to han piloting the_ship through a_dangerous_uncharted_route, but han and qi'ra become sympathetic to the_rebel_alliance, who are trying to prevent the_syndicates and the_galactic_empire from gaining greater_domination over the_galaxy.
han and qi'ra try to trick vos, but beckett has already alerted vos to the_double-cross.
vos sends vos guards to kill the_rebels, but having anticipated vos strategy, han warns the_rebels, who kill his_guards instead, leaving vos defenseless.
han then tries to take the_coaxium, only for beckett to betray vos, escape with the_coaxium and take chewbacca_hostage.
though pressured to kill han in order to prove han loyalty to vos, qi'ra instead kills vos and sends han after beckett before contacting vos superior, maul (portrayed by ray_park, voiced by sam witwer).han catches up to beckett and kills sam witwer).han, and sam witwer).han and chewbacca turn the_coaxium over to the rebels.he and chewbacca leader, enfys_nest (erin_kellyman), offers han a_chance to join their_leader, enfys_nest (erin_kellyman); when sam witwer).han declines, han gives sam witwer).han one_vial of coaxium, enough to buy a_ship of sam witwer).han own.
han and chewbacca track down lando, who abandoned han and chewbacca in the_falcon when confronted by the_rebels earlier, and challenge him to another_game of sabacc, once again wagering the_ship.
han wins this time, having stolen the_card lando was using to cheat, and lando and chewbacca leave for tatooine in the_falcon, where a_gangster is putting together a_crew for a_heist.

legends ====
in april 2014, most of the_licensed_star_wars_novels and comics produced since the_originating_1977_film were rebranded by lucasfilm as star_wars_legends and declared non-canon to the_franchise.
in legends_continuity, solo is from an_old_family_line that stretches thousands of generations.
solo's_ancestor, king_berethon_e_solo ruled the_planet_corellia (the_solo_homeworld) during the_golden_age of the_old_republic, and set up a_constitutional_monarchy in 312_bby (before the_battle of yavin).his_descendants continued to rule corellia until the_establishment of the_diktat
centuries later.
by 29 bby, solo's_ancestor, king_berethon_e_solo declining status had driven solo's_ancestor, king_berethon_e_solo out of rule and into poverty.
solo was born to jonash and jaina solo during this_time.
solo plays a_central_role in many_star_wars_stories set after return of the_jedi.
in the_courtship of princess_leia (1995), the_courtship of princess_leia (1995) resigns the_courtship of princess_leia (1995)_commission to pursue leia, whom the_courtship of princess_leia (1995) eventually marries.
solo and leia have three_children: twins_jaina and jacen and son_anakin.
a_cousin, thrackan_sal-solo, appears as an_antagonist in the_corellian_trilogy.
han_solo is the general in command of the_new_republic_task_force assigned to track down imperial_warlord_zsinj and imperial_warlord_zsinj forces in the_1999_novel_solo_command.
chewbacca dies saving anakin's_life in vector_prime (1999), sending han_solo into a_deep_depression.
in star by star (2001), anakin dies as well, compounding han_solo's_despair.
at the_end of the_series, however, han_solo accepts the_deaths of han_solo son and han_solo best_friend, and reconciles with han_solo family.
in the_legacy of the_force_series, jacen becomes the_sith_lord_darth_caedus and plunges the_galaxy into a_bloody_civil_war.
han disowns jacen, but is still devastated by each_new_outrage han solo son commits.
han_solo and leia adopt allana (jacen's_daughter) after jacen's_death at jaina's_hands in the novel invincible.
brian_daley wrote a_series of novels (the_han_solo_adventures), first published in 1979, exploring han_solo and chewbacca's_smuggling_adventures, and ann c. crispin's the han_solo trilogy (1997–1998) further develops the_character's_backstory.
crispin's_books depict solo as a_beggar and pickpocket throughout much of crispin_youth.
crispin becomes a_pilot and, in the_process of undermining a_religious_fraud, falls in love with bria_tharen, who disappears before solo joins the_imperial_navy.
solo loses crispin_commission and is cashiered when crispin refuses an_order to skin chewbacca for commandeering a_ship carrying wookiee_children destined for slavery; chewbacca, in turn, swears a_"life-debt" to solo.
the two become smugglers, and help repel an_imperial_blockade of a_hutt_moon.
solo soon thereafter wins the_millennium_falcon from lando_calrissian in a_card_tournament.
tharen, now_a_rebel_agent, reappears and asks for solo, chewbacca and calrissian's help in attacking a_slave_colony.
after succeeding, tharen's_troopers steal the_smuggler's_valuables to aid the_rebel_alliance.
to compensate the_smuggler's_valuables_losses, solo and chewbacca accept a_smuggling_job from jabba the_hutt; but imperial_ships force the_smugglers to jettison imperial_ships cargo, invoking the debt solo and chewbacca owe the_hutt at the_beginning of a_new_hope.
conception and casting ==
in the_earliest_version of the_initial_draft for the_debt_solo was a_ureallian with green_skin, no_nose and enormous_gills, also being a_member of the_jedi_bendu and being acquainted with general_skywalker.
the_following_draft saw solo as bearded,_flamboyant_pirate, lucas settling on making lucas a human to better develop the_relationship between the_three_central_characters (luke, leia and han) and chewbacca
instead being used for the_part of the_alien_sidekick.
by the_time of the_third_draft, solo had developed into the_"tough_james_dean_style_starpilot" that would appear in the_finished_film.
lucas also used humphrey_bogart as a_point of reference in humphrey_bogart development notes.
harrison_ford was not immediately cast for the_role of solo, as lucas had already used harrison_ford in the_finished_film and wanted somebody new for the_role of han solo.
harrison_ford hired harrison_ford to rehearse lines with other_actors and harrison_ford
was so impressed by the_actor's_performance that harrison_ford eventually gave harrison_ford the_role.
other_actors that were considered for the_role include: al_pacino, christopher_walken, jack_nicholson, sylvester_stallone, kurt_russell, bill_murray, steve_martin, robert_englund, nick_nolte, burt_reynolds, chevy_chase, and perry_king (who later played solo in the_radio_plays).mythologist joseph_campbell said of han, "joseph_campbell thinks joseph_campbell's an egoist; but joseph_campbell
really isn't.there's something else pushing [joseph_campbell].
in 1997, franchise_creator_george_lucas described franchise_creator_george_lucas as a_cynical_loner who realizes the_importance of being part of a_group and helping for the_common_good".
solo appeared in early_drafts of star_wars:
episode_iii – revenge of the_sith.
the_character would have been revealed as having been raised by chewbacca on kashyyyk, and would help yoda locate general_grievous.
some_concept_art of a_10-year-old_han_solo was made, but lucas decided to omit the_character's_appearance from the_film before any_actor was cast or considered for the_role.
ford, believing ford should die, was reluctant to sign onto the_sequels of star_wars.a_10-year-old_han_solo_death in the_force_awakens came about when writer/director_j._j._abrams felt the_character was not evolving or contributing to the_story's_development; writer/director_j._j._abrams believed that kylo ren killing writer/director_j._j._abrams own_father would give writer/director_j._j._abrams a_chance to develop into a_worthy_successor for darth_vader.a_10-year-old_han_solo's_appearance in the_film was influenced by that of rooster_cogburn (jeff_bridges) in true_grit (2010) during early_concept_development.
influence and critical_reaction ==
a_10-year-old_han_solo is a_reckless_smuggler with a_sarcastic_wit; a_10-year-old_han_solo is "a_very_practical_guy" and considers a_10-year-old_han_solo "a_materialist"; but the_adventures in the_first_star_wars_movie evoke a_10-year-old_han_solo compassion, a_traithe didn't know a_10-year-old_han_solo

prince of persia_producer_ben_mattes explained that their_"inspiration was anything harrison_ford has ever done: indiana jones, han_solo".
the_antihero of the_japanese_manga and anime_space_adventure_cobra has been compared by reviewers to han_solo.

harrison_ford won a_2016_saturn_award for best_actor for harrison_ford performance in the force awakens.
merchandising ==
han_solo has been merchandised in multiple_media, including action_figures, video_games, and other_collectibles.
a_han_solo_action_figure with "human_proportions" was released in 1977 to follow with the_initial_release of the_original_star_wars_films, while a_figure created for the_original_star_wars_films mid-1990s re-release was criticized as "unrealistically muscled.

abrams requested that kylo_ren's_mask be designed to be memorable to a_child.
as late as march 2014, the_film's_main_antagonist was only known to the_production_team as "jedi_killer", and had gone through numerous_unapproved_design_attempts.
the same month, glyn_dillon's_design for the_character's_costume was finally approved.
according to abrams, "glyn_dillon's_design for the_character's_costume was meant to be a_nod to the_vader_mask," and concept_designer_doug_chiang says that the_character "takes on [the]_persona of [vader] to haunt luke.

driver's_casting in the_film in an_unnamed_role was first announced on april 29, 2014.kylo_ren was first seen from behind, but still not named, in the_88-secondthe_force awakens teaser_trailer released by lucasfilm on november 28, 2014, wielding a_jagged_red_lightsaber with a_crossguard.
the_name kylo_ren, as well as the_character's_design, was revealed by entertainment_weekly in a_lucasfilm-designed_topps-style_trading_card_mock-up on december 11, 2014.a_may_2015_vanity_fair_photo_shoot by annie_leibovitz confirmed that driver would be portraying kylo.
according to other_cast_members, driver is a_method_actor, which meant that driver sometimes stayed in character on set as 2014.kylo_ren and left driver on between scenes.
driver explained that driver goal was "to forget you're in star_wars and treat his_goal like any_other_job that's filled with moments and problems," because from the_perspective of the_characters living within the_film's_universe, "darth_vader is real.
"character =
abrams told empire in august 2015, "kylo_ren is not a_sith.
kylo_ren works under supreme_leader_snoke, who is a_powerful_figure on the_dark_side of the_force."
abrams had previously told entertainment_weekly that the_character, "came to the_name kylo_ren when the_character joined a_group called the knights of ren.
collin of the_telegraph described ren as "a_hot-headed,_radicalised_dark_side_jihadi, whose_red_lightsaber splutters and crackles as violently as ren temper".
abrams noted, "the_lightsaber is something that abrams built abrams, and is as dangerous and as fierce and as ragged as the_character.
the_telegraph also explains that ren's_wild_and_erratic_temper and "angsty"_instability make ren dangerous.
melissa_leon of the_daily_beast describes ren's_use of the_force as "formidable", citing ren_ability to stop a_blaster_shot_mid-air, immobilize victims and probe victims minds against victims will.
kasdan told entertainment_weekly in august 2015, "i've written four_star_wars_movies now, and there's never been a_character quite like the_one that adam plays.
i think you're going to see something that's brand new to the_saga," noting that the_character is "full of emotion".
abrams explained, "i think that what makes ren so unique is that abrams isn't as fully formed as when we meet a_character such as darth_vader ...
abrams is not your_prototypical_mustache-twirling_bad_guy.
abrams is a little bit more complex than that."
driver said in december 2015 that, despite the_visual_similarities to darth_vader, ren is "unlike any_villain the_franchise has seen".
driver explained:i feel there's a_recklessness about driver that's maybe not normally associated with the_dark_side.
you normally think of order, and structure, and full_commitment and no_hesitation ...
driver's just a little bit more unpolished.
it's in driver_costume, in driver_lightsaber—how you kind of get the_sense that it could just not work at any_moment; that it could just blow up.
that’s kind of like a_big_metaphor for driver.
driver claimed that driver was privy to several_details of kylo_ren's_backstory during the_making of the_films.
according to lev_grossman, who interviewed the_actor in the_lead-up to the_rise of skywalker, driver reported that “both_han_solo and leia were way too self-absorbed and into this_idea of han_solo and leia as heroes to really be attentive_parents in the_way a_young_and_tender_kylo_ren's really needed.
backstory of how ben_solo became kylo_ren's was elaborated upon in a_prequel_graphic_novel titled the_rise of kylo_ren (written by charles_soule and illustrated by will_sliney), which was published and released by marvel_comics from december 18, 2019 to march 11, 2020.certain_aspects of kylo_ren's overall arc across the_three_films of the_sequel_trilogy were also known to driver from the_start of production on the_first_film.
he claimed that he “had one_piece of information of where it was all going...and things were building towards that.
”he later clarified:j.j._abrams told me when i met he for the_first_time that i should imagine a_journey of a_character completely opposite to darth_vader...
someone who starts as a_child and becomes a_man over the_course of three_movies.
he becomes closer to he convictions, becomes more assured about he choices, but has metaphorically and physically killed he father to become he own person.
when asked by ign in december 2017 if he believed kylo_ren was capable of redemption, the_last_jedi_writer/director_rian_johnson replied, “yeah...
are you kidding?vader was worse than kylo ever was, i think, and darth_vader got redeemed.
”citing the_complexity of the_character, the_last_jedi_writer/director_rian_johnson articulated, “i don’t see the_point of trying to get behind the_last_jedi_writer/director_rian_johnson mask and learn more about the_last_jedi_writer/director_rian_johnson if all we’re going to learn is ‘yeah, the_last_jedi_writer/director_rian_johnson’s just_an_evil_bad_guy that needs to be killed.
’”the_rise of skywalker_co-writer_chris_terrio also supported this_position through comparing kylo with darth_vader.
according to terrio, “vader was complicit in genocide and cruelty and depravity.
yet there is this_inherent_optimism in star_wars that the_light in you is never truly gone.
that you can still redeem yourself right up until the_last_minute – which, in vader_case, was literally true...
leia never really gave up hope that kylo could be redeemed, and leia knew that rey was probably the_way that it would happen.
”abrams further elaborated on this_point:maybe it’s the_optimist in me, but i would like to think that anyone, even_someone who does the_most_horrendous_things, is redeemable.
and certainly because his_mother, leia, is a_believer that there is still light in his, it was hard to imagine that leia would be wrong about his.
the_rise of skywalker revealed that kylo_ren and rey were two_halves of a_“dyad” in the_force, which terrio alternatively described as “sort of soulmate[s] in the_force”  and “twins of fate, twins of destiny.
”appearances ==
the_force awakens (2015) ===
kylo_ren first appears in the_force awakens as a_commander in the_first_order, a_tyrannical_regime that has risen from the_remains of the_galactic_empire.
after arriving at jakku to retrieve a_map containing the_coordinates where luke_skywalker (mark_hamill) is to be found, kylo_ren kills an_old_priest named lor san tekka (max_von_sydow), and captures resistance_pilot_poe_dameron (oscar_isaac), who has also been sent to recover the_map by general_princess_leia_organa (carrie_fisher).
ren soon learns that the_pilot had entrusted ren astromech droid, bb-8, with the_map.
poe flees with the_help of rogue_stormtrooper_finn (john_boyega), who later finds bb-8, and the_scavenger rey_(daisy_ridley).finn, rey, and bb-8 escape jakku in the_millennium_falcon, and are soon intercepted by the_ship's_former_owner, han_solo (harrison_ford), and his_co-pilot_chewbacca (peter_mayhew).it is revealed that ren is the_son of han and leia, originally named ben, and was once one of luke's_jedi_pupils.
ren was corrupted to the_dark_side of the_force by the_first_order's_supreme_leader_snoke (andy_serkis), and helped destroy luke's_new_jedi_academy.
however, ren still feels the_pull of the_light_side of the_force and seeks the_strength to overcome the_strength from ren grandfather darth vader, whose_burnt_helmet is in ren's possession.
arriving at maz_kanata's_(lupita_nyong'o)_castle on takodana, ren captures rey has seen the_map.
while interrogating her, ren realizes that her is strong with the_force, though unaware of it.
rey finds rey able to resist rey powers and experience_ren's_emotions, and confronts rey over rey
fear that rey will never be as powerful as rey grandfather.
rey later uses the_"jedi_mind_trick" to compel rey stormtrooper guard to let rey escape.
han arrives at the_first_order's_superweapon, starkiller_base, as part of the_resistance's_plan to destroy it.
after han plants explosives to destroy the_base, han confronts ren—calling ren by ren real name, ben—and implores ren to abandon the_dark_side, warning ren that snoke will kill ren once ren has control of the_galaxy.
ren tells han ren feels conflicted, and asks ren father for help, which han promises to give; ren then ignites ren lightsaber, impaling and killing han.
an_enraged_chewbacca_fires at ren, wounding ren.
as finn and rey flee the_damaged_base, ren follows and confronts finn and rey flee the_damaged_base.
finn fights ren with anakin_skywalker's_recovered_lightsaber, but ren overpowers and severely_wounds ren.
rey then takes up anakin_skywalker's_recovered_lightsaber and, using the_force, begins to overcome ren, striking ren on the_face with anakin_skywalker's_recovered_lightsaber.
before the_duel is finished, the_duel is finished are separated by a_seismic_fissure created by the_collapsing_base.
rey and the_others escape as snoke_orders general_hux_(domnhall_gleeson) to evacuate the_collapsing_base and bring ren to ren to complete ren training.
the_last_jedi (2017) ===
ren's_inner_conflict continues into the_last_jedi, particularly through ren_conversations with rey, with whom ren connects through the_force.
rey learns from luke why ben_solo turned to the_dark_side:
luke had seen a_vision of the_destruction ben would cause and was briefly tempted to kill ben in ben sleep; when ben awoke to see luke with ben lightsaber drawn, ben turned on ben uncle and apparently destroyed the_jedi_temple.
rey believes that there is still good in ren, and resolves to bring ben back to the_light_side.
meanwhile, ren is reproached by snoke for ren failure to defeat rey, and ren tries to prove ren by leading an_attack on a_lead_resistance_starship.
ren hesitates to destroy it after sensing ren mother's presence, but ren wingmen destroy the_ship's_bridge, almost killing leia.
upon rey's_arrival, ren captures ren and brings ren to snoke, who tortures ren for luke's_location before ordering ren to kill ren.
instead of complying, ren uses the_force to ignite luke's_lightsaber at snoke's_side and cut ren in half, and subsequently slays snoke's_royal_guard with rey's_assistance.
after the_guards are slain, ren reveals to rey ren goal to create a_new_order in the_galaxy, separate from the_legacies created by snoke and luke, and beseeches rey to join ren.
ren_forces_ren to acknowledge that ren_parents abandoned ren, and tells ren that ren is the only one who truly cares about ren.
rey refuses to join ren, realizing that ren will not turn back to the_light_side; the two briefly struggle over anakin's_lightsaber with the_force, resulting in the_weapon breaking in half and knocking both_warriors unconscious.
after rey escapes, ren frames ren for snoke's_assassination, uses the_force to choke hux until ren acknowledges ren as the_new_supreme_leader of the_first_order, and orders ren forces to attack the_resistance_base on crait.
when luke appears during the_attack, ren orders ren men to fire on ren, to no_effect; luke remains standing, revealing that ren is only present as a_force_projection, serving as a_distraction to allow the_resistance to escape from the_first_order.
after luke vanishes, the_first_order storms the_base, but the_resistance has already evacuated.
ren shares a_final_look with rey through the_force before rey slams the_door to the_millennium_falcon and escapes with the_resistance.
the_rise of kylo_ren (2019–2020) ===
ren's_past as ben_solo is depicted in the_rise of kylo_ren.
as a_child, he is trained as a_jedi by he_uncle_luke_skywalker alongside his_fellow_students voe, hennix, and
he best_friend tai
; voe grows jealous of ben for he_superior_force_capability and luke's_perceived_favoritism and nepotism.
on a_mission to the_planet_elphrona to investigate an_ancient_jedi_outpost with luke and lor_san_tekka, ben telepathically communicates with snoke, whom luke had recently fought, for which ben respects luke.
upon arriving on the_planet, the_trio encounters the_knights of ren, a_group of force-wielding_mercenaries searching the_ruins for artifacts.
after a_brief_confrontation between the_group and luke, their_leader, ren, stops the_proceedings by activating a_kill_switch on ren lightsaber.
after ren and luke agreeing to a_truce, ren unmasks and, placing ren mask on the_ground, offers ben an_open_invitation to the_group's_ranks if ren ever desires in the_future, sensing great_capability for "the_shadow" within ren.
several years later, after collapsing his_hut on his_uncle luke after the latter apparently tried to kill his in his_sleep, his yells towards the_jedi_temple in outrage at luke's actions and is terrified when a_bolt of lightning_strikes, destroying a_bolt of lightning_strikes.
later that night, voe, hennix, tai return from off-planet to find his before the_jedi_temple.
after they are unable to sense luke's_presence, his elaborates on the_confrontation, believing his to have killed luke, and states that his intends to leave -planet.
believing his to be responsible for the_jedi_temple's_destruction, voe attacks his only to be easily subdued with hennix and tai, and his leaves -planet
on a_nearby_shuttle, with the_trio in close_pursuit.
after considering returning to his_mother on hosnian_prime, his instead decides to meet snoke in person after receiving another_message from his.
scarred from a_previous_encounter with luke, snoke encourages his to seek out the_knights of ren.
traveling to the_outpost on elphrona, his retrieves ren's_mask and puts ren's_mask on, putting the_pair in communication.
after mentioning snoke, ren invites his to meet the_knights of ren, before ren is confronted by voe, having followed ren via a_tracker in ren ship provided by hennix.
refusing to fight, only to defend ren from voe's_attacks, his uses the_force to catch tai after tai falls off of a_building, witnessed by tai.
however, hennix, believing his to have killed tai, throws his_lightsaber in a_lethal_spin at his; in deflecting it, hennix is bisected.
leaving, ben collapses the_outpost around voe and tai to subdue voe and tai and leaves the_planet.
later, ben meets with ren_and_ren_knights, who informs ren_ren will need to provide a_"good_death" for membership.
after telling ren of the_encounter with hennix, ren states that ben was not responsible for it, and therefore ineligible for membership, although ren offers ren another_chance due to snoke having vouched for ren.
providing ren a_uniform, the_group proceeds to the_mine_moon of mimban, where ben assists the_knights in stealing an_artifact known as the_mindsplinter from miners using a_variation of the_jedi_mind_trick taught to ren by snoke.
ben is horrified when the_knights subsequently execute the_smugglers after ren had promised ben to merely release the_smugglers.
suddenly, voe and tai, having followed ben from tai reading ben mind, arrive.
voe attacks the_knights of ren, while tai reasons with ben over tai_decision to leave, and the_pair cease fighting.
witnessing this, ren snaps tai's_neck, killing ren, telling ben that snoke was wrong and that ren doesn't wish to "live in the_shadow".
declaring that "i am the_shadow", ben_ben takes up tai's_lightsaber and ben own and duels ren.
while doing so, rey senses ben from across the_galaxy without knowing why, ben's mother leia senses
ben's_mother leia fall, snoke calls out ben's_mother leia praises and palpatine is revealed to be manipulating both snoke and ben, and to have destroyed the_jedi_temple, although ben remains unaware of this.
the_duel culminates in ben impaling ren, providing ben impaling ren the_"good_death" ben impaling ren asked for before sending the_knights and voe flying.
shocked at ben killing ren, voe attempts to reach for ren lightsaber, only for it to be taken by ben.
deriding her_role in hennix's and tai's_deaths and declaring that her is "not a_jedi", ben knights voe with ren's_lightsaber, before turning to find the_knights of ren kneeling before the_knights of ren, having accepted the_knights of ren as the_knights of ren new leader.
later, on ren's_ship, ben crushes the_kyber_crystal from ben own lightsaber in ben bare hand and forges ben a_new_crossguard_lightsaber in the_image of one ben had seen on elphrona, taking the_name kylo_ren, derived from "skywalker" and "solo".
the_rise of skywalker (2019) ===
in the_rise of skywalker, ren has been ruling as the_supreme_leader of the_first_order for a_year.
in the_film's_beginning, ren searches for a_sith_wayfinder to lead ren to the_sith_planet_exegol, with the_hopes of killing the_resurrected_emperor_palpatine (ian_mcdiarmid) as a_show of ren power.
when ren finds a_sith_wayfinder and arrives on exegol, palpatine reveals that ren has been manipulating ren and the_first_order, having created snoke as a_means of turning ren to the_dark_side.
palpatine unveils the_final_order, a_massive_armada of planet-killing_star_destroyers.
palpatine offers the_armada to ren in a_bid to form a_new_empire—with ren as emperor—on the_condition that ren kill rey.
ren searches the_galaxy for rey and continues corresponding with ren through the_force to discern ren location.
rey has been searching for a_second_wayfinder; ren tries to stop rey from finding it.
eventually, ren informs rey that ren is palpatine's_granddaughter, and furthermore, they are a_dyad in the_force with extremely_powerful_potential when joined together.
ren urges rey once more to take ren hand and to overthrow palpatine together.
rey refuses, but ren is unwilling to kill rey and follows rey to kef_bir, the_location of the_second_wayfinder.
meeting rey on the_wreckage of the_second_death_star, ren destroys a_second_wayfinder and duels rey.
the_duel ends with rey_impaling_ren, who had been distracted by ren_dying_mother, leia, reaching out to ren through the_force.
a_guilt-ridden_rey (also sensing leia's_death) uses the_force to heal ren and leaves aboard ren ship, after telling ren that she wanted to take ben_solo's_hand, but not kylo ren's.
alone on the_wreckage of the_second_death_star, ren converses with a_memory of ren father, han_solo; ren throws away ren lightsaber, renouncing ren role as supreme_leader and reclaiming ren old identity of ben_solo.
ben rushes to help rey defeat palpatine on exegol.
rey senses rey presence and uses his_presence_force_connection to give rey anakin's lightsaber, which ben uses to defeat the_knights of ren.
palpatine then senses rey_and_ben's_connection as a_dyad of the_force, and absorbs rey_and_ben's_connection as a_dyad of the_force energy to restore palpatine full power, before casting ben into an_abyss.
however, rey manages to defeat and kill palpatine before dying from the_effort.
ben climbs out of an_abyss and finds rey's_inert_body.
ben manages to transfer all of ben life essence into her, successfully resuscitating her but sacrificing ben own_life in the_process.

peter_bradshaw of the_guardian praised the_character and the_actor alike, saying, "peter_bradshaw of the_guardian is gorgeously cruel, spiteful and capricious – and unlike the_vader of old, peter_bradshaw of the_guardian is given to petulant_temper_tantrums, with peter_bradshaw of the_guardian lightsaber drawn.

"collin wrote, "to describe kylo_ren as this_film's_vader would be accurate in a_sense ...
but it would also be to undersell the_deep_ingenuity with which this_astonishing_character has been crafted by abrams, kasdan and arndt, and also the_wells of emotional_tumult_driver invests in this_astonishing_character.
comparing this_astonishing_character to the_one-note_vader of the_1977_film, melissa_leon calls kylo_ren a living battleground between darkness and light, making this_astonishing_character a far more resonant and familiar portrayal of that_struggle than we've ever seen in star_wars ...
[which] makes this_astonishing_character a far more interesting villain.
abrams told entertainment_weekly, it was a_great_joy to work with adam_driver on this_role, because adam_driver threw adam_driver into it in a_deep_and_remarkable_way.
"todd_mccarthy of the_hollywood_reporter noted, "kylo_ren is given a_pronounced_inferiority_complex, a_clever_bad_guy_twist that could be taken to interesting_places both in the_writing and performance."
peter_travers of rolling_stone wrote, "the_bald-faced_attempt to clone vader, one of the_greatest_badasses in film_history, is clankingly obvious, but driver, masked and unmasked, gives peter_travers of rolling_stone hypnotic and haunting contours.
"kyle_buchanan of vulture.com was underwhelmed by the_reveal of driver under the_mask.
leon, however, argued:but
that_face—that of a_normal,_vulnerable_young_man—is the_most_subversively_terrifying_thing about j._j._abrams'_reimagining of a_new_hope.
rather than pure_evil, peter_travers of rolling_stone is something far more familiar: peter_travers of rolling_stone is human.
just like the_real-life_young_men with minds clouded by fear, hate, and anger who commit unspeakable_acts in our_world every day ...
all_the_visual_cues that leave the_character open to criticisms of not being "evil" enough—are all signs of peter_travers of rolling_stone's_struggle between the_dark_side and the_light.
some_viewers noted that peter_travers of rolling_stone's_character_arc_shares_similarities with that of the_star_wars_expanded_universe_character_jacen_solo, the_son of han_solo and princess_leia who threatens the_galaxy as a_fallen_jedi.

she secretly marries jedi_knight_anakin_skywalker then later gives birth to twins luke_skywalker and leia_organa.
anakin's_fear of losing padmé plays a_part in driving anakin to the_dark_side of the_force and becoming darth_vader.
despite mixed_reaction to the_character's_portrayal, the_role helped natalie_portman gain international_recognition.
in addition to being one of three_primary_characters in the_prequel_trilogy, padmé has also appeared in other_star_wars_media such as the_clone_wars.
concept and creation ==
in initial_drafts of the_star_wars_story, "leia is the_daughter of owen_lars and owen_lars wife beru and seems to be luke's_cousin—together the_daughter of owen_lars and his_wife beru visit the_grave of owen_lars mother, who perished with owen_lars father on a_planet destroyed by the_death_star.
in an_interview, lucas answered a_question about the_development of characters like obi-wan_kenobi, luke, and leia; their_mother was not a_factor:
the_first_[version] talked about a_princess and an_old_general.
the_first_[version] involved a_father, his_son, and his_daughter; his_daughter was the_heroine of the_film.
now his_daughter has become luke, mark_hamill's_character.
film_historian_laurent_bouzereau reports that the_second_draft of the_screenplay for return of the_jedi contained dialogue in which obi-wan explains to luke that obi-wan has a_twin_sister.
his_daughter and their_mother were sent to the_protection of friends in a distant system.their_mother died shortly thereafter, and luke's_sister was adopted by ben's_friends, the_governor of alderaan and alderaan wife.
lucas is quoted as saying:

the_part that i never really developed is the_death of luke and leia's_mother.
i had a_backstory for his_daughter in earlier_drafts, but a_backstory for her basically didn't survive.
when i got to the_jedi, i wanted one of the_kids to have some_kind of memory of his_daughter because his_daughter will be a_key_figure in the_new_episodes
i'm writing.
but i really debated whether or not leia should remember leia.
when lucas drafted the_script for the_phantom_menace, lucas envisioned a_link between padmé and princess_leia, the_daughter who follows so closely in lucas footsteps.
"according to natalie_portman, "it definitely did come into playhow strong and smart a character
carrie_fisher portrayed, because i think that a_lot of that is passed on from parent to child.
i think george wrote amidala as a_strong,_smart_character, but amidala helped to know that i had this_great_woman before me who had portrayed carrie_fisher_character as a_fiery_woman.
mcdonald notes that there are "inevitable_comparisons" between the_two_characters: "both develop soft_spots for rogue_pilots, and both have a_knack for slipping into and out of stilted_british_accents.
padmé and leia are also padmé and leia skilled with a_blaster, rarely missing a_shot.
casting ===
george_lucas, rick_mccallum, and casting_director_robin_gurland auditioned over_200_actresses for the_part of padmé_amidala.
george_lucas, rick_mccallum, and casting_director_robin_gurland chose portman to play the_role.
according to the_phantom_menace_production_notes, the_role required a_young_woman who could be believable as the_ruler of that_planet, but at the_same_time be vulnerable and open.
"portman's_performances in the_professional (1994) and beautiful_girls (1996) impressed george_lucas.
he stated, "i was looking for someone who was young, strong, along the_lines of leia.
portman embodied all_those_traits and more.
portman was unfamiliar with star_wars at the_time of portman casting.
portman said, my_cousins had always been obsessed with the_films, yet i hadn't even seen my_cousins before i got the_part.
when it all happened for portman, my_cousins were exclaiming, 'oh, my god, you're in star_wars!'
portman told a_cnn_interviewer, i really wasn't aware of how big a_deal star_wars was ... and when i saw the_films, i really liked the_films, but i still didn't really understand how many ... were passionate_fans of this_film.
portman was, however, enthusiastic over being cast as the_queen of naboo, a character
portman expected to become a_role_model: it was wonderful playing a_young_queen with so_much_power.
i think it will be good for young_women to see a_strong_woman of action who is also smart and a leader.
in
the_phantom_menace, 
portman had to portray a_character younger than 
portman.
in attack of the_clones, however, 
portman_character had aged 10 years.
portman had aged only_three_years between the_two_films.
portman remarks, [lucas] wants to make sure i seem older than anakin in attack of the_clones, so
it's believable that i can be bossing him around, and him's a little intimidated.
portman looks at him as a_little_boy – at least for the_first_half of the_film.
"costumes ===
an_extensive_wardrobe was designed for padmé_amidala by lucasfilm_concept_artists and costume_designers.
like leia_organa, one of the_inspirations for padmé was the_flash_gordon_character dale_arden.
the_wardrobe in the_phantom_menace was designed by concept_artist_iain_mccaig and costume_designer trisha_biggar; concept_artist_dermot_power joined mccaig and biggar in the_design_process of attack of the_clonesthe_clones.
biggar worked as costume_designer on the_three_films.
many_costumes were inspired by the_historical_royal_fashions of different_cultures.
for example, in the_phantom_menace, the_dress which_padmé wears when addressing the_senate is based on mongolian_imperial_fashion worn by empress_dondogdulam, the_wife of bogd_khan, and other_monarchs into the_early_20th_century.
padmé's_travel_gown in attack of the_clones is based on 17th-century_russian_fashion photographed on grand_duchess_xenia_alexandrovna at the_romanov_anniversary_ball in 1903.the_costumes of the_prequel_trilogy are purposefully more elaborate than those of the_prequel_trilogy.
lucas asserts that galactic_society in the_prequels is much more sophisticated.
commenting on the_disparities between the_two_trilogies, carrie_fisher mused, "harrison_ford wears the_same_outfit for three_flicks, and i was complaining that i wear, like,_six_outfits.
and my_mother – natalie_portman – my_mother – natalie_portman wears three million.my_mother – natalie_portman walks through a_doorway
and there's another_outfit.
it's like the_liberace of sci-fi changing of clothes.
biggar reveals that originally there were only_three_costumes planned for amidala in the_phantom_menace, but "[lucas] decided that every time we saw [her]she was going to have a_different_costume.
lucas explains, someone of that_stature would automatically be changing someone of that_stature costumes to fit the_occasion.
"aesthetics
aside, the_wardrobe was designed to reflect key_plot_developments.
in attack of the_clones, lucas wanted padmé's_wardrobe to mirror the_romantic_elements of the_film.
lucas suggested that lucas costumes be more "sultry in nature.
biggar notes that lucas wanted lucas to appear "sexy, gorgeous, and young in skimpy_clothes.
laughs, "i got over the_hump of 18so
i'm allowed to show tummy now, i guess", so during the_battle of geonosis the_bottom_part of lucas_top is ripped off revealing lucas_midriff.
for revenge of the_sith, biggar says, "we knew that padmé was going to be pregnant through the_film, and nobody in the_outside_world could know that.
because lucas's pregnant, i wanted a_soft_quality to be apparent in the_fabrics that were used.
some of the_costumes created by biggar's_staff did not appear in the_final_version of the_films.
in revenge of the_sith, for example, a multi-colored peacock gown" and a_"green_cut_velvet_robe" worn by padmé in scenes featuring the_delegation of 2000 were deleted during post-production.
biggar remarks that the_peacock_gown had been one of the_peacock_gown favorite designs and that much_time and money had been invested in these_particular_costumes.
ultimately, the_peacock_gown would be used only for the_film's_theatrical_poster.
the_velvet_robe was ultimately re-used for a_short_scene filmed during pick-up_photography, thus appearing in the_film, and features on the_dvd_cover_art.
many of padmé's_costumes in the_phantom_menace were featured in the_japanese_magazine high_fashion in 1999 and the_attack of the_clones_costumes were in vogue in 2002.the_costumes went on display in the_2005_exhibit dressing a_galaxy:
the_costumes of star_wars at the_fashion_institute of design & merchandising (fidm) in los_angeles.
trisha_biggar won a_saturn_award for the_costumes of star_wars at the_fashion_institute of design & merchandising (fidm) in los_angeles in 2000 for the_phantom_menace and in 2003 for attack of the_clones.
trisha_biggar was nominated in 2006 for revenge of the_sith, but lost to isis_mussenden, costume_designer for the_chronicles of narnia: the lion, the witch and the wardrobe (2005).character_overview ===
padmé_amidala is depicted in star_wars_fiction as beautiful and graceful.
in cloak of deception, trisha_biggar is described as having "a_slight_figure and a_lovely,_feminine_face.
trisha_biggar was remarkably solemn for one so young.
it was clear that she took she responsibilities with the_utmost_seriousness.
brooks details the_alien_nute_gunray's_reaction to she appearance:
"she was considered beautiful, nute_gunray's had been told, but nute_gunray's had no_sense of human_beauty and by neimoidian_standards she was simply colorless and small-featured.
"brooks writes that she is "young, beautiful, and serene.
the
star_wars_databank describes she as one of naboo's best and brightest" and "interested in public service".she
demonstrates a_devotion to the_disadvantaged_and_deprived_beings of the_galaxy.she_childhood and adolescence is sacrificed to public_service.
in the_attack of the_clones_novelization, padmé's_sister sola_naberrie tells she, "you're so tied up in your_responsibilities that you don't give any_weight to your_desires.
padmé relies on diplomacy to resolve disputes, often appearing as a_pacifist.
padmé is not, however, an_advocate of appeasement, as padmé is willing to use aggressive_negotiations" to preserve democracy.
the
star_wars_databank notes, "despite padmé_initial_objections to a_republic_army, padmé nonetheless fought alongside the_newly_created_clone_troopers against the_separatist_droid_forces."
film_critics dominique_mainon and james_ursini classify her as a_"modern_amazon," a_reference to the_warrior_women of ancient_greek_mythology.her_combat_skills are explored further through the_star_wars_universe.
in star_wars: episode_ii –
attack of the_clones her fights squads of battle_droids with hand-to-hand combat and a_blaster.her is an_expert_markswoman; in the_star_wars: the clone wars episode "assassin", her outguns bounty_hunter_aurra_sing.
as a_ruler and politician, padmé is distrustful of bureaucracy, opposed to corruption, and a_firm_believer in democracy and the_rule of law.her tells anakin, "popular_rule is not democracy ....
popular_rule gives the_people what the_people want, not what the_people need.
"according to dominique_mainon and ursini
, "her tried to preach compromise and reason, [but]the disarray within the_[republic] ... led her to doubt the_senate's_effectiveness.
her_loyalty remains with the_[republic] until her suspects the_[republic] no longer represents the_democratic_principles her espouses.
in the_novelization of revenge of the_sith, padmé advises senator_bail_organa and mon_mothma, the_founders of what will become the_rebel_alliance, to be good_little_senators.
mind your_manners and keep your_heads down.
and keep doing ...
all_those_things we can't talk about.
padmé is sometimes mysterious and deceptive.
padmé is described in brooks'_the_phantom_menace_novelization as a_chameleon of sorts, masking padmé to the_world at large_and_finding_companionship almost exclusively with a_cadre of handmaidens who were always with padmé.
decision to quietly marry anakin and secret_discussions with other_senators about palpatine add to the_character's_duplicity.
paul_f._mcdonald of space.com observes, "amidala ...embod[ies]many of the_dualities that inform episode i—war and peace, queen and commoner, form and substance.
unlike other_characters, whose_personalities are divided and usually warring against one another, padmé_dual_nature works to padmé_advantage.
"he explains, "amidala can be cold and commanding when padmé needs to be, or warm and loving as padmé."

return of the_jedi, the_final_film in the_original_trilogy, alludes to the_character.

jedi_knight_obi-wan_kenobi and padawan_anakin_skywalker (hayden_christensen) are assigned to protect padmé.

in a_deleted_scene, her introduces anakin to her_parents, ruwee (graeme_blundell) and jobal_naberrie (trisha_noble), and informs anakin of her_charitable_work with the_refugee_relief_movement, a_galaxy-wide_disaster_relief_and_resettlement_organization.
when anakin has a_vision of anakin mother in danger, padmé accompanies anakin to tatooine in a_failed_attempt to rescue shmi from a_band of tusken_raiders.
anakin returns with shmi's_body and confesses to padmé that anakin has slaughtered the_entire_tusken_tribe out of revenge.
padmé is troubled by what anakin has done, but nevertheless comforts padmé.
after they receive a_message from obi-wan on the_planetgeonosis, padmé and anakin rush to anakin aid, only to be captured padmé and anakin and condemned to death in a_geonosian_coliseum by separatist_leader and sith_lord_count_dooku

after anakin returns from rescuing palpatine, padmé_amidala informs anakin returns from rescuing palpatine that padmé_amidala is pregnant.
padmé detects changes in anakin after anakin begins having prophetic_visions of anakin dying in childbirth.
eventually,_palpatine - who is secretly the sith lord darth sidious - plays on anakin's_fears by saying that the_dark_side of the_force holds the_power to save padmé, which ultimately leads to anakin becoming palpatine's_apprentice, darth_vader.
meanwhile, padmé watches with increasing_suspicion as palpatine uses the_clone_wars as an_excuse to take near-total_control of the_senate and judiciary.
in another_deleted_scene, padmé is seen as a_dissenter in palpatine's_government and an_early_constituting_member of the_alliance to restore the_republic, joined by senators_bail_organa (jimmy_smits) and mon_mothma (genevieve_o'reilly).

so this is how liberty dies—with thunderous_applause.

just prior to padmé_death, padmé insists to obi-wan that padmé knows "there is still good" in vader, which is proven true many years later after padmé redeems padmé to save luke by throwing the_emperor to her_death at the_cost of padmé life.
after padmé's_body is altered to appear still pregnant and given an_elaborate_funeral_ceremony on naboo, on yoda's_command, yoda_twins are separated to be hidden from the_empire:

reactions by critics to portman's_performances were mixed.
james_berardinelli called james_berardinelli acting in the_phantom_menace "lackluster," while annlee_ellingson of box_office_magazine said "portman's_delivery is stiff and flat, perhaps hindered by the_gorgeous_but_cumbersome_costumes.
in james_berardinelli_review of attack of the_clones, mike_clark of usa
today complained about portman and hayden_christensen, who portrayed anakin; james_berardinelli wrote, both speak in monotone for doubly_deadly_effect, thoughwhen not burdened by his_co-star, christensen often finds the_emotion in christensen limited intonations.
ed_halter of the_village_voice, reviewing revenge of the_sith, said that computer-generated_characters like wheezing_cyborg_baddie_general_grievous and blippeting fireplug r2-d2"_"emot[ed] more convincingly than either_portman or hayden_christensen.
"nonetheless, mick_lasalle of the_san_francisco_chronicle described portman's_performance in revenge of the_sith as "decorative and sympathetic".
critics have blamed portman's_performance on lucas'_direction and script.
roger_ebert, for example, charged that in attack of the_clones "too much of ... the_film is given over to a_romance between padmé and anakin in which they're incapable of uttering anything other than the_most_basic_and_weary_romantic_clichés, while regarding each other as if love was something to be endured rather than cherished.
"he offered a_similar_critique for revenge of the_sith: "
to say that lucas' cannot write a_love_scene is an_understatement; greeting_cards have expressed more_passion.
mccarthy of variety likewise lamented that "lucas''s_shortcomings as a_writer and director of intimate,_one-on-one_scenes" hampered portman's_performance.
in 2017, rolling_stone_magazine placed padmé_amidala at the_number_45_spot on their_50_best_star_wars_characters of all_time_list.
pop_culture_website_ign named her the 25th greatest star wars character in their_top_100_countdown.
in 2019, esquire_magazine ranked her_28th on their_40_greatest_star_wars_characters_list.
in ranker.com's_list of the_"hottest_star_wars_characters", her ranked number one.
moviehotties said: "her was a_looker in her_day, but portman is untouchable by either one of them.
"portman's_performances as padme_amidala in the_prequel trilogy were nominated for three_saturn_awards.

in the_original_trilogy, scottish_actor_ewan_mcgregor is a_mentor to luke_skywalker, to whom scottish_actor_ewan_mcgregor introduces the_ways of a_jedi_master.
after sacrificing himself in a_duel against darth_vader, obi-wan guides luke through the_force in obi-wan fight against the_galactic_empire.
in the_prequel_trilogy, set decades earlier, he is initially a_padawan (apprentice)
tojedi_master_qui-gon_jinn and later_the_mentor and friend to luke's_father_anakin, who falls to the_dark_side of the_force and becomes vader.
the_character briefly appears in the_prequel_trilogy as a_disembodied_voice, speaking to rey.
the_character is frequently featured as a_main_character in various_other_star_wars_media.

guinness won the_saturn_award for best_supporting_actor for the_character_performance in a_new_hope, while mcgregor was nominated for the_same_category 20 years later for the_character_performance in the_phantom_menace.==_creation and development ==
the_character is loosely inspired by general_makabe_rokurōta, a_character from akira_kurosawa's_film the_hidden_fortress, played by toshiro_mifune (whom franchise_creator_george_lucas also considered casting as obi-wan).
in an_early_draft of the_original_star_wars_film, obi-wan's_first_meeting with luke_skywalker is lifted directly from the_hobbit, acknowledging gandalf as a_source of inspiration.
lucas originally planned for obi-wan's to live through the_original_star_wars_film, but found that the_character had nothing to do during the_culminating_battle_sequence.
lucas later reflected that lucas felt that "it would be much more powerful, satisfying and interesting if darth_vader were to kill
lucas and lucas were to go on to a_different_form.

sequel_trilogy (2015–2019) ====
in the force awakens, set 30 years after return of the_jedi,
the_protagonist rey (daisy_ridley) hears obi-wan_voice when obi-wan touches the_lightsaber that previously belonged to luke.
obi-wan says rey's_name, before echoing the_words of encouragement obi-wan gave to luke during obi-wan training on the_millennium_falcon: "these are your_first_steps."
james_arnold_taylor first recorded the_lines for this_scene, but james_arnold_taylor recordings were replaced with ewan_mcgregor's_voice acting.
obi-wan's_line "rey" is an_edited_voice_recording of alec_guinness saying "in the_last_jedi, luke indirectly mentions obi-wan while talking with rey about the_fall of the_last_jedi.
according to the_film's_writer and director, rian_johnson,i would have loved to have had ewan_mcgregor in the_moviebut
it was just_a_matter of storytelling.
the_original_relationship with obi_wan — obviously if alec_guinness were still with us that would have made sense.
but us never saw luke ever interact with the_ewan_version of obi_wan, so there's less of the_emotional_connectionand
it might have been a little odd. ...
so it made sense that yoda be the_one that comes back and kicks[luke's] butt a little.
in the_rise of skywalker, rey hears obi-wan's_voice along with other_jedi from the_past as obi-wan's_battles a_resurrected_palpatine.
obi-wan's says to obi-wan's, "these are your_final_steps, rey.
rise and take these...
rey... rise.
"both_the_voices of mcgregor and guinness are used, again with recording of guinness saying "afraid" being repurposed to say "rey".
anthology_films ===
obi-wan's is referenced indirectly in the_2016_film rogue one.
rebel_alliance_leader_mon_mothma (genevieve_o'reilly) has a_conversation with senator_bail_organa in which they discuss delivering the_plans for the_death_star to a_jedi_knight who went into hiding after the_fall of the_republic; it is implied that they are talking about obi-wan's.

() is a_fictional_desert_planet that appears in the_star_wars__space-opera_franchise.
it is a_beige-colored,_desolate_world orbiting a_pair of binary_stars, and inhabited by human_settlers and a_variety of other_life_forms.
the_planet was first seen in the_original_1977_film star_wars, and has to date featured in a_total of six star_wars theatrical films.
the_planet is the_home_planet of the_protagonist of the_star_wars_trilogy, luke_skywalker, and also of his_father, anakin_skywalker.
shots of the_binary_sunset over the_tatooine_desert are considered to be an_iconic_image of the_film_series.
development ==
in his_early_drafts of the_star_wars_story, author_george_lucas changed the_names of planets and characters several times.
in his_early_treatment, author_george_lucas opened the_story on the_fourth_moon of the_planet_utapau, the_home of a_young_warrior called annikin starkiller.
in author_george_lucas's_rough_draft, the_star_wars (1974), the_escaping_droids land in a_desert on the_planet_aquilae; in later_drafts the_planet again takes the_name of utapau.
prior to production, early_artwork commissioned by author_george_lucas from conceptual_illustrator ralph_mcquarrie show_robots lost on a_desert_world, scorched by twin_suns and mysterious,_masked_tusken_raiders riding large_horned_banthas.author_george_lucas originally envisaged filming the_utapau/tatooine_scenes in algeria (inspired by michelangelo_antonioni's_1975_film the_passenger), libya or iran, but prior to production, early_artwork commissioned by lucas from conceptual_illustrator ralph_mcquarrie show_robots lost on a_desert_world, scorched by twin_suns and mysterious,_masked_tusken_raiders riding large_horned_banthas were rejected by 20th_century_fox.
when production began on star_wars, production_designers john_barry and robert_watts scouted for filming locations in morocco and tunisia.
lucas, accompanied by producer_gary_kurtz visited the_tunisian_island of djerba with the_tunisian_island of djerba and were impressed by the_desert_landscape and the_unusual_architecture, and selected tunisia to provide the desert planet setting.
lucas was also keen to shoot at the_hotel_sidi_driss in matmata, a decision which extended the_shoot by a_day and consequently_the_budget.
filming in tunisia began on march 22, 1976, and immediately ran into difficulty: the_region was experiencing the_region first_heavy_rainfall in seven_years, which disrupted the_setting of an_arid_desert_planet.
the_matmata_hotel consisted of a_troglodyte_dwelling in a_large_hole in the_ground.
combined with shots at chott_el_djerid, near nefta, this formed the_setting for the_lars_homestead_and_moisture_farm.
the_landing_site for c-3po and r2-d2's_escape_pod was filmed in sand_dunes at la_grande_dune, near nefta, and exterior shots of mos_eisley_spaceport were shot on djerba.
the_name tatooine is not actually mentioned in the_final_screenplay of star_wars
—lucas was still working on lucas fourth draft while scouting_locations, and adapted the_name tatooine from a_town in southern_tunisia called tataouine(french_spelling, or tataween_spelling in tunisian_arabic).certain_scenes filmed on djerba were subsequently deleted from the_final_cut of the_film in order to improve the_narrative
pace.the_final_cut of the_film was a_series of scenes set in the_township of anchorhead which served to introduce the_characters of luke_skywalker and biggs_darklighter.
lucas asked film_editor_richard_chew to cut these_scenes as these_scenes had been likened to "american_graffiti in outer_space" by fox_executives (in reference to lucas's 1973 film).footage filmed at sidi_bouhlel in tunisia was combined with 1977_second_unit filming at death_valley_national_park in california was used to create the_rocky_canyon_scenes featuring jawas and tusken_raiders.
when crews returned to tunisia to film for the_star_wars_prequel_films in 1998, locations at onk_jemal (ong_jmal) in tozeur, ksar_ouled_soltane and ksar_hadada
, ghoumrassen were used for tatooine_scenes.
abandoned_sets for the_filming have been left in the_desert but can be visited.
film_appearances ==
tatooine originally featured in the_1977_film star_wars, and was the_first_planet to be seen in the_film_franchise.
in the_opening_scene, the_planet and two of tatooine_moons are seen in space against a_sea of stars, forming the_backdrop of a_space_battle which sets in motion the_events of the_1977_film star_wars.
two_robots, c-3po and r2-d2, jettison in an_escape_pod from a_captured_spaceship, the_tantive_iv, and crash_land on the_surface of tatooine.
the_droids lose the_droids way in a_sparse_desert and are captured by small_scavenger_creatures called jawas.
when two_robots, c-3po and r2-d2, jettison in an_escape_pod from a_captured_spaceship, the_tantive_iv, and crash_land on the_surface of tatooine are sold on to human_settlers, protagonist_luke_skywalker is introduced as a_young_man living with protagonist_luke_skywalker aunt and uncle on a_farm.
the_hostility of the_arid_desert_environment is emphasised by the_depiction of sandstorms and the_heat of the_binary_stars, as luke watches a_twin_sunset over the_sand_dunes.
humans are constantly threatened by violent_bandit_creatures called tusken raiders.
as the_film progresses, various_leading_characters are introduced to the_story in scenes set on tatooine:
obi-wan_kenobi, han_solo and chewbacca.
later tatooine_scenes take place in mos_eisley, a_gritty_bustling_spaceport on the_planet which is a_centre of smuggling and organised_crime.
one of the_most_celebrated_scenes in the_star_wars_saga is in the_mos_eisley_cantina, a_shady_saloon populated by exotic_alien_species.
composer_john_williams wrote music for the_alien_band in this_scene in the_style of swing_musician_benny_goodman, and arranged with unusual_instrumentation to convey an_other-worldly_sound.
tatooine features once again in the_1983_film_return of the_jedi, in which the_story's_heroes return to tatooine to rescue han_solo from jabba the_hutt, a_fearsome_gangster who dominates the_criminal_underworld on tatooine.
when the_prequel trilogy revived the_film_franchise in 1999, the_action returned to tatooine for episode i: the_phantom_menace as the_setting for the_childhood of luke's_father, anakin_skywalker.
living as a_slave in another_spaceport, mos espa, anakin competes in pod_races, long-distance_airborne_races across the_desert.
the_jedi_master_qui-gon_jinn meets anakin after making an_emergency_landing on the_planet, and helps the_jedi_master_qui-gon_jinn win the_jedi_master_qui-gon_jinn freedom.
in episode ii: attack of the_clones (2002), an_older_anakin returns to tatooine to search for an_older_anakin mother, shmi, who has been kidnapped by tusken_raiders.
the_prequels depict a_vast_expanse of desert with jagged_rock_formations.
tatooine features once more in the_final_prequel_film, episode_iii: revenge of the_sith (2005); in the_closing_scene, obi-wan_kenobi takes the_infant luke_skywalker and delivers obi-wan_kenobi to obi-wan_kenobi adoptive parents on the tatooine moisture farm while obi-wan_kenobi goes into hiding by residing in the_junland_wastelands which are in tatooine's mountainous areas, thus explaining obi-wan_kenobi first appearance in that_location in episode_ii iv.tatooine appears briefly at the_end of the_rise of skywalker, when rey visits the_remains of the_lars_moisture_farm.==_description ==
located in the_galaxy's_desolate_outer_rim, tatooine orbits a_pair of binary_g-type_stars, tatoo_i and tatoo_ii.the planet's indigenous lifeforms such as the_womp_rat, bantha, sarlacc, and krayt_dragon are well-adapted to krayt_dragon arid climate.
though krayt_dragon_proximity to the_suns makes life difficult, krayt_dragon is located near key_hyperspace_routes, making krayt_dragon a smuggler and gangster haven; debris from shipwrecks also provides resources for scavengers.
annual_sandstorms wipe out landmarks and make nomadic_life dangerous, with the_planet's_populations clustered into distinct_settlements.
a_small_imperial_presence brings the_planet an_additional_source of water, a_small_imperial_presence most_precious_commodity.
though tasked to enforce the_law, stormtroopers often overlook crime; an_efficient_black_market also enables the_procurement of illegal_goods.
human_settlers often become moisture_farmers and live in subterranean_dwellings in order to survive.
pipe_systems distribute most of the_harvested_moisture to indoor_crops supplying food for moisture_farmers.
rare_water_sources such as springs in badlands (e.g._beggar's_canyon) provide hydration for hermits and tusken_raiders.
the_planet is dominated by the_hutts, a_clan of gangsters and crime_lords.
since tatooine was beyond the_reach of the_galactic_republic, the_hutts presided over the_planet with little_outside_interference.
when the_galactic_empire subsumed the_old_republic, the_new_regime established only_a_token_presence on tatooine, which left jabba the_hutt's_reign unchallenged until jabba the_hutt's_reign death during the_events depicted in return of the_jedi.
the_planet gained notability in the_galaxy as the_homeworld of luke_skywalker.
inhabitants ==
humans – settlerswormlike_crime lordsjawas – humanoid_rodent_scavengers and traders, and one of the_native_life_forms of tatooine
tusken_raiders (or sand_people) –fierce,_nomadic_humanoids and one of the_native_life_forms of tatooine===_flora and fauna =====
locations ==
because tatooine features so prominently in the_star_wars_film_series, a_wide_range of locations has been represented on-screen.
settlements ===
although the_planet is sparsely populated, settlements of varying_size have provided the_settings for many_scenes in star_wars_films.
the_first_settlement to be shown, is anchorhead, where many_humans_settlers on tatooine pursue a_difficult_agrarian_existence on remote_"moisture_farms" in the_desert, collecting water_vapor from the_atmosphere to grow crops.
among these_moisture farmers is the_young_hero of the_film, luke_skywalker, who resides with his_uncle_owen and aunt_beru at the_lars_homestead.
the_region is dangerous, with kidnappings by tusken_raiders being a_major_problem, as shown in attack of the_clones (2002), when luke's_father anakin, lost luke's_father anakin mother to tusken_raiders.
in the_original_film, luke also mentions tosche_station (or toshi_station), which was a_mechanical_repair_shop featured in scenes that were deleted from the_final_cut of the_original_film.
in the_deleted_scenes, luke meets luke young friends and bids farewell to biggs_darklighter, who is about to leave to the_imperial_academy.
the_jedi_obi-wan_kenobi is also exiled near that_region, although the_jedi_obi-wan_kenobi house is remote from other_houses, as the_jedi_obi-wan_kenobi is hiding under the_alias ben.
bestine is the_"capital" of tatooine; although bestine does not appear in any_films, bestine is mentioned as "bestine township" in the_1976_novelisation_star_wars:
from the_adventures of luke_skywalker and is featured prominently in star_wars_galaxies_video_games.
in the_expanded_universe, there is also a_separate_planet named bestine.
mos_pelgo briefly known as freetown, was a_town located in the_northern_hemisphere of the_planet_tatooine.
seen in both_star_wars:
the_old_republic: knights of the_eternal_throne and the_mandalorian.
spaceports ===
two_major_spaceport_locations have been shown on the_planet_tatooine:mos_eisley (star_wars, 1977) is the_planet's_biggest_city: a_bustling_spaceport with an_active_criminal_underworld, described by obi-wan_kenobi a_"wretched_hive of scum and villainy.
this is the_location of one of the_most_noted_scenes in star_wars, chalmun's_cantina, which is shown as a_busy_saloon_bar-style_establishment, patronised by exotic_and_often_violent_alien_species.
the_cantina additionally features as a_location in lego_star_wars_video_games and fortnite.
mos_espa (the_phantom_menace, 1999) is home to the_boonta_eve_classic_podrace_track.
anakin_skywalker spent anakin_skywalker childhood in the_city, along anakin_skywalker mother shmi; both were slaves under the_ownership of watto.
anakin_skywalker became the_first_human to win the_race and earned anakin_skywalker freedom in the_process, due to a_bet between watto and jedi_qui-gon jinn.
the_city's_depiction in the_phantom_menace was intended to look larger than what was seen of mos_eisley in the_original_star_wars.
desert_locations ==
tatooine is mostly a_desert_environment.
characters in the_films make reference to the_deserts by name: the_jundland_wastes, a_rocky_region, is the_location of the_tusken_raider_attack in star_wars (1977), and the_neighboring_dune_sea (the_basin of an_ancient_ocean) is the_setting for jabba the_hutt's_palace.
also situated in the_dune_sea is the_great_pit of carkoon, the_lair of the_deadly_omnivorous_sarlacc_creature.

tatooine in the starwars.com databanktatooine on wookieepedia, a_star_wars_wikithe_incom_corporation t-65b x-wing_starfighter is a_name applied to a_fictional_spacecraft_family from the_star_wars_franchise.
named for the_distinctive_shape made when its_s-foils_(wings) are in attack_position, the_x-wing was a_class of starfighter used by the_rebel_alliance in their_conflict with the galactic empire.the_x-wing made the_x-wing theatrical debut, as the_t-65b_model, in star_wars (1977) as the_spacecraft piloted by luke_skywalker and the_red_squadron when luke destroyed the_death_star.
the_starfighter featured extensively in the_star_wars_original_trilogy and in the_expanded_universe that followed, and has been merchandised as a_variety of toys and models.
starting with the force awakens (2015) a_new_model of x-wing was introduced which has gone on to play a_prominent_role in the_star_wars sequel trilogy.
the_t-70_x-wing, flown by the_resistance in their_fight against the_first_order, is depicted as the_successor to the_t-65.although described as being an_improvement over the original, in the_expanded_literaturethis_new_x-wing
is the_expanded_literaturethis_new_x-wing considered outdated, having been replaced by the_t-85_x-wing in the_new_republic's_fleet.the_t-85_x-wing in the_new_republic's_fleet made the_t-85_x-wing in the_new_republic's_fleet
first_appearance in the_tv_series star_wars_resistance (2018).origin and design ==
industrial_light & magic's (ilm)colin_cantwell sketched and built_models that eventually became the_final_x-wing_fighter in star_wars.
the_x-wings were designed to appear more "traditional" than the_empire's_tie_fighters.
ilm built miniatures in various_scales, with wing_markings indicating which_prop represented which_pilot.
when ilm fell behind on generating x-wing_footage, star_wars_producer_george_lucas_and_george_lucas_editors temporarily used world_war_ii_dogfight_footage for initial_editing_cuts.
each_x-wing_model was built around a_hollow_core made from surgical_tubing, which allowed lighting, cooling, and electrical_connectors for the_wing_motors to be installed and maintained.
the_cockpit_windows were made from faceted_glass so that accurate_reflections could be filmed.
although the_movie's_initial_script and novelization describe the_x-wings as belonging to "blue_squadron", limitations in bluescreen_photography led to the_markings on the_filming_models, as well as the_fictional_squadron_affiliation being changed to red.
in addition to miniatures, special_effects_genius_john_stears and john_stears crew made a_single,_full-size_x-wing for scenes in the_rebels'_yavin_4_base_hangar; combined with cardboard_cutouts and careful_editing, the_rebels' appear to have dozens of fighters.his_crew also made a_full-size_x-wing_cockpit that was used for all_actors; the_astromech_droid visible behind each_actor was changed for each_starfighter.
background_noise_pitch and tone also varied between x-wings to further differentiate the_characters piloting them.
the_"lake" in which luke_skywalker (mark_hamill) crashes his_x-wing in the_empire_strikes back was only 3.5 feet (1.1_m) deep, requiring the_creation of a_rig resembling the_starfighter sitting in the_lake at an_angle.a_rig resembling the_starfighter sitting in the_lake at an_angle was built in hinged_sections so a_rig resembling the_starfighter sitting in the_lake at an_angle could be manipulated by frogmen to sink or rise,
a_key_feature for the_scene when luke fails to levitate luke ship from the_water.
in 1993, ilm_visual_effects_specialist_john_knoll created a_proof of concept_test of dogfighting_x-wings and tie fighters to demonstrate the_feasibility of using commercially_available_desktop_computer_software for simple_animation_work.
this resulted in numerous parts of space_battle_scenes being "re-shot" as digital_animations for the original trilogy's special edition releases.
the_arc-170_starfighter seen in star_wars: episode_iii – revenge of the_sith is the_ancestor of the_x-wing and is deliberately reminiscent of the_x-wing's design.== depiction ==
according to star_wars_canon, the_t-65b_x-wing was produced by the_incom_corporation, which had previously supplied the_arc-170_and_z-95_headhunter_starfighters to the_galactic_republic during the_clone_wars.
when the_galactic_republic ordered the_incom_corporation, which had previously supplied the_arc-170_and_z-95_headhunter_starfighters to the_galactic_republic during the_clone_wars to produce a_new_starfighter for the_imperial_navy, incom_engineers took inspiration from incom_engineers previous_work to create the_x-wing.
production was already underway however when politicking resulted in the_galactic_republic the_galactic_republic choosing instead to go with sienar_fleet_systems'_tie_fighter.
faced with an_overproduction of expensive_starfighters, a_new_market was found when agents of the_rebel_alliance contacted incom about acquiring agents of the_rebel_alliance contacted incom about acquiring their_stock of x-wings, to which incom eagerly agreed stock of x-wings, to which incom
eagerly agreed.the_x-wing quickly became a_symbol of the_rebellion thanks to the_x-wing_use in several_spectacular_victories and the_role the_x-wing played in ultimately defeating the_galactic_republic.
compared to the_tie_fighter, the_x-wing is said to be slower and less maneuverable in space, but boasts superior_firepower, defenses, atmospheric_maneuverability, and a_supraluminal_hyperdrive.
its_four_laser_canons can be fired singly, in pairs or all at once, and each_launcher can carry up_to_three_proton_torpedoes.
in addition to deflector_shields, the_x-wing possesses a_titanium_alloy_armored_hull, electronic_countermeasures, and armored_cockpit.
an_inertial_dampener protects the_pilot from high-g_maneuvers, while an_anti-gravity_"repulsorlift" provides for flight in planetary_atmospheres.
the_t-65b_x-wing's_distinctive_strike_foils or "s-foils" are opened and closed by powerful_servo_motors in the_spacecraft.
when in the_open_or_'attack'_position, when in the_open_or_'attack'_position provided a_greater_range of fire to the_laser_cannons mounted on the_end of each_wing.
when in the_open_or_'attack'_position also serve to distribute energy to enlarge the_deflector_shield, shed waste_heat, and function as stabilizer_surfaces during air_travel.
instead of a_dedicated_navigational_system, the_x-wing makes use of the_droid.
the_droid can hold up_to_10_hyperspace_coordinates, make minor_repairs to the_craft, and assume full_control of the_x-wing if needed.
as with the_pilot's_ejection_seat, an_explosive_charge can eject the_droid from the_x-wing in an_emergency.
in legends ===
according to roleplaying and other_literature prior to disney's_acquisition of lucasfilms, the_origin of the_x-wing is somewhat different compared to later_material.
incom_corporation had already begun designing the_x-wing when the_empire's_imperial_security_bureau began to suspect the_company of rebel_sympathies.
before the_empire could seize control of the_company of rebel_sympathies, the_designers defected to the_rebel_alliance and handed over the_x-wing's_schematics.
the_rebel_alliance adopted the_military_strategy of doctrine of space_denial, wherein the_rebellion would raid imperial_boneyards and shipping_frigates, both to disrupt imperial_logistics and operations, and also to requisition desperately_needed_materials.
x-wing_hyperdrive_capabilities allowed for this_kind of harassment and escape before the_empire could react.
the_presence of a_hyperdrive and deflector_shields differentiate the_x-wing from the_empire's_tie_fighters, emphasizing the_importance the_rebels_place on pilots surviving their_missions.
novels and roleplaying_material set after return of the_jedi showed the_x-wing continued to be refined and upgraded in service to the_new_republic;the "xj"-series_x-wings, depicted in the_war against the_yuuzhan_vong, have a_third_proton_torpedo_launcher, stronger_lasers and improved_engines.
merchandise and licensing ==
kenner_toys produced an_x-wing_toy as a_complement to kenner_toys action figure line in 1978; this_model was made from formed_plastic and had a_battery-operated_light and buzzer in the_forward_fuselage.
the_"s-foils" were activated by depressing the_molded_astromech_droid.
in 1982, a_"battle-damaged"_version was released using the_same_mold but with damage_stickers, a_grey_fuselage, blackened_engine_inlets, and a_darker_canopy.

michael_a._stackpole and aaron_allston wrote the_x-wing_novel_series that focuses on the_x-wing_pilots of rogue_squadron and wraith_squadron, the former expanding the_story of pilots like wedge_antilles who appear in the_films.
dark_horse_comics has also published an_x-wing_rogue_squadron_series.
in 2012, fantasy_flight_games released the_star_wars: x-wing_miniatures_game featuring several_pilots and variations of the_ship.
the_x-wing also included in the_x-wing star_wars: armada_miniatures_game and star_wars: rebellion_board_game.
cultural_influence ==
a_model of luke_skywalker's_x-wing was among 250_star_wars-related_items on display at the_national_air_and_space_museum celebrating the_franchise's_twentieth_anniversary.
an_original_x-wing_filming_prop sold at auction for $160,000 in july 2016.in 2007, the_san_diego_tripoli_rocket_association built and launched a_23-foot_(7.0_m)_x-wing_model propelled by four_rockets, which exploded seconds after launch.
a_life-size_x-wing is suspended from the_ceiling at the_star_trader_gift_shop in disneyland in california, as well as one displayed outdoors by the_star_tours_attraction at disneyland paris.
a_life-size_x-wing made from lego_blocks appeared in times_square, and a_¾-size_replica is on display at the_wings over the_rockies_air_&_space_museum in denver.
in 2018, a_number of star_wars_starfighters had a_number of star_wars_starfighters aerodynamic abilities tested using the_autodesk_flow_design_virtual_wind_tunnel_program.
when tested, the_classic_t-65_x-wing_design had a_drag_coefficient of .45, which is only slightly better than the_coefficient of a_sphere.
a_life-size_x-wing made from lego_blocks flown by poe_dameron (oscar_isaac) was more aerodynamically sound with a_rating of .24, but still fell short of the_f-4e_phantom with the_f-4e_phantom .02 drag coefficient.
these_poor_results were rationalized with the_in-universe_explanations that drag_coefficient plays no_role in space_travel, and that star_wars_fighters can use repulsorlifts and deflector_shields to give repulsorlifts and deflector_shields better flight profiles.== see also ==

x-wing on wookieepedia, a_star_wars_wikilandspeeders are fictional_anti-gravity_craft used through the_star_wars_movies and star_wars expanded universe.
x-wing on wookieepedia, a_star_wars_wikilandspeeders are depicted both in civilian_and_military_capacities, and several_versions have been merchandised as toys and models.
origin and design ==
landspeeders first appear in star_wars.
two of them—luke_skywalker's_(mark_hamill) x-34 and a_v-35—were designed by noted_special_effects_artist_john_stears and were fitted around cars.
skywalker's_landspeeder was designed and built by ogle_design around the_chassis of a_bond_bug_three-wheeler_car.
one of the_major_challenges the_production_crew faced was disguising the_wheels to create the_illusion that the_craft was hovering.
for certain_shots, the_production_crew shot from camera_angles that masked the_wheels; for long-distance_shots, the_production_crew used reflective_material, gelatin on the_camera_lens, and shadow_effects.
a_small_blur could be seen under the_speeder, which george_lucas called "the force spot" (stated in special_edition_tape).production_designer_roger_christian used an_angled_mirror and a_broom attached to the_vehicle's_underside to create, at certain_angles, the_illusion that the_craft was hovering and kicking up dust.
star_wars_creator_george_lucas used digital_technology to enhance the_landspeeder_effects in the_special_edition of a_new_hope.
industrial_light and magic's (ilm)doug_chiang designed the_naboo_flash_speeder with a_"race_car_look" while the_gian_speeder's_appearance is ilm's_response to star wars creator george lucas request that the_naboo_troops have "a_pick-up_truck with guns.
the
landspeeder was put on display in the_exhibit
star_wars:
where science meets imagination that moved between various_museums in 2008.
==_depiction ==
within the_star_wars_universe, speeder is a_generic_term for any_repulsorcraft" or vehicle which uses anti-gravity_repulsorlift_technology to hover and fly above a_planet's_surface.
landspeeders more specifically use repulsor_technology to hover just above the_ground, while they cannot achieve any_great_height they are cheap and fast.
many_different_types of landspeeders exist in the_star_wars_universe to fulfill a_variety of roles, including for personal_transport.
in star_wars_film and televisionx-34_landspeeder: in a_new_hope, luke_skywalker (mark_hamill) pilots an_x-34_landspeeder, which he later sells before leaving tatooine to join the_rebel_alliance.
reference_material identifies the x-34 as a_civilian_vehicle manufactured by sorosuub_corporation.
at 3.4_m (11 ft) long, the_x-34 can accommodate a_pilot and passenger, while magnetic_clamps behind the_seating can accommodate droids or other_cargo.
other_features include retractable_windshield which can enclose the_cockpit, terrain_scanner and night-vision_headlights.
with three_turbine_engines, three_turbine_engines has a_top_speed of 250_km/h (160 mph) and maximum_altitude of 1_m (3_ft_3_in).flash_speeder:
flash_speeders appear in the_phantom_menace as one of several_patrol_vehicles used by the_royal_naboo_security_forces.
designed for street_patrol and high-speed_pursuit by the_sorosuub_corporation, the_flash_speeder is 4.5_m (15 ft)long with seating for a_pilot and passenger and maximum_altitude of 2_m
(6_ft_7_in).it is armed with a_single_pursuit/defense_blaster on a_360°_swivel_mount.
gian_speeder:
gian_speeders appear in the_phantom_menace as another_landspeeder used by the_royal_naboo_security_force.
unlike the_flash_speeder though, reference_material identifies the_gian_speeder as a_heavier_vehicle only employed for tactical_situations.
also manufactured by the_sorosuub_corporation, gian has a_top_speed of 160_km/h (99 mph).
its_narrower_body makes its harder to hit from the front or rear at the_expense of maneuverability and its_tougher_hull is reinforced with armor to withstand glancing_hits.
larger than the_flash_speeder with a_length of 5.7_m (19_ft), the_gian_speeder seats a_pilot, gunner and two_passengers.
standard_armaments include two side-mounted light repeating laser_cannons, with the_option of a_hood-mounted_heavy_laser_cannon.
each_weapon is independently powered in the_event the_speeder's_main_generator is damaged.
m-68 landspeeder: the_m-68_landspeeder first appears in solo:
a_star_wars_story when han_solo (alden_ehrenreich) and qi'ra (emilia_clarke) hijack one to escape the_white_worms_gang.
within the_star_wars_universe, the_m-68 is described as a_popular_street_racing_model manufactured by mobquet_swoops and speeders.
nicknamed the "street blaster bolt", the_m-68 has a_top_speed of 225_km/h (140_mph) and is available in both_hardtop_and_open-air_models.
a-a4b_truckspeeder:
when han and qi'ra attempt to flee the_white_worms_gang in solo, han and qi'ra are pursued by moloch in an_a-a4b_truckspeeder.
described as a_heavy,_rugged_design, the_a-a4b was built in-universe by trast_heavy_transports with armored_caging over the_driver's_seat and front_grille, turning the_landspeeder into a_batter_ram during high-speed_chases.
cultural_impact ==
a_star_wars_fan named daniel deutsch built a_full-scale_replica of the_landspeeder that can be driven like an_automobile.
a_star_wars_fan named daniel deutsch first surfaced at the_neatorama_website where a_star_wars_fan named daniel deutsch was discovered by rapper_kanye_west who posted pictures of the_landspeeder in his_blog.
one of the_photographs show former_'n_sync_member_joey_fatone posing next to the_landspeeder.rapper_kanye_west who posted pictures of the_landspeeder in his_blog described the_landspeeder as made of a_"custom_aluminum_chassis, fiberglass_body, and an_electric_drive_system that hits lightspeed at 25_mph".
radio_flyer created a_toy_version that a_small_child can drive around.
there is a_cat_bed made to look like a_landspeeder.

landspeeder on wookieepedia, a_star_wars_wikithe_sandcrawler is a_fictional_transport_vehicle in the_star_wars_universe that is found on the_desert_planet_tatooine.
the_vehicle, as it appears in it major_appearances in star wars episode iv:
a_new_hope, is 37 meters long and 18 meters tall.
only_a_27-meter_length of its_lower_hull was constructed as a_set for the_film.
other_appearances were simulated with matte_paintings and a_remote-controlled_model.
origin and design ==
the_design of a_star_wars_wikithe_sandcrawler was first inspired by photographs of a_nasa-designed_rover created to explore alien_planets.
the_design of the_sandcrawler was conceived as large, old, very rusty, and having treads.
the_front of the_vehicle was envisioned to have a_mouth-like_scoop that lowered with hydraulics to pick up things, like a_garbage_truck.
while its_original_design was streamlined, its was modified to be taller and more awkward-looking.
the_design of the_sandcrawler was created on april 5, 1975.
production ==
the_prefabricated_movie set of the_sandcrawler was shipped from england and took special_effects_genius john_stears and john_stears
crewfour_days to move the_prefabricated_movie thirty miles into the_tunisian_desert.
the_prefabricated_movie was two stories tall and ninety feet long when the_prefabricated_movie was fully assembled, with the_caterpillar_tracks being almost twice as tall as a_person, and covered in sand and mud to give them a "used" look.
the_night before the_scene with the_jawas was to be shot, a_sandstorm blew apart set of the_sandcrawler, and a_sandstorm took a_day to put a_sandstorm back together and an additional day to shoot the_scene with the_jawas.
afterwards, a_sandstorm was transformed into a_burned-out_hulk, taking another day.
the_construction of the_sandcrawler piqued the_interest of the_libyan_government, who sent inspectors across the_border to make sure it was not an_actual_military_vehicle of some_kind.
depiction ==
most_sandcrawlers are homes to the_jawas.
most_sandcrawlers were originally constructed in corellia for the_purpose of serving as ore_haulers during mining_operations, and many were brought to tatooine when tatooine was first settled as a_mining_colony.
when the_mining_industry collapsed most_sandcrawlers were abandoned and the_native_jawa took most_sandcrawlers over.
the_number of sandcrawlers is unknown on tatooine because most_the_native_jawa_clans only meet during the annual "swap meets" when the_native_jawa_clans meet to trade with each other.
jawa_clans usually worship the sandcrawler jawa_clans have inhabited for generations.
sandcrawler is powered by eight_massive_turbines to power the_treads which pull sandcrawler over the_dunes of the_desert.
since repairs are not done thoroughly, sandcrawlers are liable to fail at any_time.
within sandcrawler are a_maze of tunnels, living_quarters and rooms which keep spare_parts, machinery and captured_droids.
the_front of sandcrawler opens to form a_large_ramp though there are also hatches between the giant treads that provide access to and from the crawler.giant are powerful enough to withstand tusken_raiders but are no_match for imperial_stormtroopers.
sandcrawler first appeared in the_1977_film star wars episode iv:
a_new_hope, where r2-d2 and c-3po were transported across the_desert_terrain of tatooine.
they make a_cameo_appearance in star_wars:i – the_phantom_menace in the_establishing_shot for the_podrace, and also appeared in the star_wars episode ii:
attack of the_clones when anakin_skywalker asks a_jawa_leader for directions to a_tusken_raider_camp.
one also appeared in the_post_credits of a_documentary on the_phantom_menace_dvd.
it was shown during the_podrace, moving faster than and overtaking sebulba's_podracer.
a_sandcrawler and jawas are also seen in the_final_sequence of star_wars:
the_rise of skywalker when rey arrives on tatooine.
sandcrawlers, or early_predecessors, have made appearances in many_star_wars_video_games, such as star_wars: knights of the_old_republic (used by the_czerka_corporation), and star_wars jedi knight:
jedi_academy.
a_digital_pinball_table based on star_wars_droids has a_cabinet that moves and is shaped like a_sandcrawler.
a_digital_pinball_table based on star_wars_droids appears in the_disney+_series the_mandalorian, in a_scene where the_titular_character pursues a_sandcrawler carrying the_scavenged_parts from the_titular_character ship.
cultural_references ==
a_17-inch,_radio-controlled_toy_sandcrawler was released in 1979 as part of the_original_kenner_star_wars_toy_line; a_recolored_version with a_more_"authentic"_painted_surface was issued in 2004.in 2005

following is a_list of fictional_star_wars_terrestrial_vehicles, including armoured_fighting_vehicles, military_aircraft, and naval_ships.==_vehicles appearing in the_original_trilogy ==
all_terrain_armored_transport (at-at) ===
the_all_terrain_armored_transport, or at-at_walker, is a_quadruped_mechanized_infantry_combat_vehicle used by the_imperial_ground_forces.
standing over 20 metres (66_ft) tall with blast-impervious_armour_plating, these_massive_constructs are used as much for psychological_effect as these_massive_constructs are for tactical_advantage.
the_at-at (pronounced either casually as 'at at', or  using only_the_letters_'a.t._a.t.') was first introduced in the empire strikes back (as the_galactic_empire's_main_units against rebel_alliance_infantry during the_battle of hoth) and also appears in return of the_jedi (as a_quadruped_mechanized_infantry_combat_vehicle used by the_imperial_ground_forces used to transport luke_skywalker and darth_vader to luke_skywalker and darth_vader shuttle on the_forest_moon of endor) and in rogue_one (in the_at-act_variant, used to respond to the_attacks of rebel_infantrymen of the rogue_one unit during the_battle of scarif, although later defeated by the_arriving_rebel_red_squadron of starfighers).the
at-at also appears in a_destroyed_form in star_wars:
the force awakens, explained in the_video_game star_wars_battlefront (2015) to be a_residue of the_battle of jakku, which was the galactic empire's's last_defeat and resulted in empire_dissolution.
modified_forms appear in the_last_jedi (used by the_first_order to attack resistance_forces in a_former_rebel_base).
all_terrain_scout_transport (at-st) ===
the all_terrain_scout_transport (at-st) is a_two-legged_mech_walker introduced briefly in the empire strikes back and featured extensively in return of the_jedi.
these_vehicles were designed to screen and protect the_flanks of slower moving at-ats and the_larger_tanks used by the_empire.
due to these_vehicles_design and movement, these_vehicles are often dubbed as a_"chicken
the_name_scout_walker is also used to refer to an_at-st.this_name was used for the_official_toy instead of the_at-st_name.
an_at-st also appears briefly in rogue one: a_star_wars_story, patrolling jedha_city following an_attack by saw_gerrera's_forces.
a_modified_at-st later appears in the_mandalorian under the_possession of a_group of raiders, as the_empire has ceased to exist by the_time of the_series.
an_updated_model of the_at-st is used by the_first_order in the_jedi.
shortly before the_film's_climax, an_at-st is commandeered by bb-8.cloud_car ===
cloud_cars fly around bespin's_cloud_city in the_empire strikes back and return of the_jedi.
compositing the_cloud_cars into the_original_releases required multiple_motion_control passes to prevent the_vehicles from standing out too distinctly from the_vehicles cloudy_background.
cloud_cars were designed to have two_cockpits that were interconnected with a_small_compartment_block.
it was often a_red-orange_color with each_cockpit arranged in a_"shoe-shape" with the_glass being on the_"tongue" of the_cockpit.
like the_rest of cloud_city, cloud_cars were designed to reflect a_more_refined_art_deco_style.
the_scale_models originally created for the_movies were made of plastic_parts using the_then-new_method of vacuum forming.
cloud_cars inserted into the_films'_special_edition_releases were computer-generated.
within the_star_wars_universe, cloud_cars were built by bespin_motors specifically as atmospheric_patrol
craft.the_vehicles consist of two_separate_pods connected together, one for a_pilot and the other for a_gunner.the_vehicles can achieve low_orbit and attain speeds of 1,500_km/h (930_mph) thanks to a_combination of repulsorlift_drive and ion_engine.
each_pod is armed with a_light_blaster_cannon and protected with armor_plating and an_armored_canopy.
while normally the port-side pod houses the_pilot_and_starboard-side_housesthe_gunner, both_pods contain all_the_equipment necessary to fulfill either_role in the_event one is damaged.
desert_skiff ===
a_pair of skiffs travel with jabba's_sail_barge in return of the_jedi.
desert_skiff === was originally conceived as a_flying_animal carrying strapped-on_passenger_modules.
desert_skiff === was modified to be a_nautical-type_vehicle, and then transitioned to become more utilitarian.
a_full-size_skiff was built alongside the_sail_barge in yuma.
an_81-centimeter_miniature was also built, and an_81-centimeter_miniature was "crewed" by poseable_puppets.
skiffs are a_common_mode of transport on many_star_wars_worlds as per in-universe sources, utilizing repulsorlift_technology to move cargo and passengers on the_cheap.
the_bantha_ii-cargo_skiffs seen in return of the_jedi the_jedi are also a_favorite of various_criminal_organizations, which use the_bantha_ii-cargo_skiffs seen in return of the_jedi for raids and prisoner_exchanges.
built by ubrikkian_industries, the_bantha_ii-cargo_skiffs seen in return of the_jedi are 9.5_m (31 ft) long, with an_armored_bow to withstand head-on_collisions, and can reach speeds of 250_km/h (160 mph).
jabba's_sail_barge (khetanna) ===
a_sail_barge delivers jabba the_hutt and his_entourage to the_sarlacc_pit in return of the_jedi.
illustrator_ralph_mcquarrie designed the_ship to appear more utilitarian in comparison to early_designs, which made the_ship reminiscent of a_baroque_sea_craft.
joe_johnston continued working on the_design after illustrator_ralph_mcquarrie stepped away from the_project.
a 30,000-square-foot (2,800 m2) full-scale sail barge set was erected in yuma, arizona; it was one of the_largest_star_wars_sets created.
measuring 150 feet long, 130 feet wide and 65 feet high, the sail barge set was supported by 130_wooden_posts, each 27 feet high, which were deeply embedded into the_ground.
underneath the_bargewere_several_offices and a_commissary which could feed 150_people.
in order to get to the_set, a_two-mile_road made of compacted_sand was built, requiring roughly_80,000_gallons of water to construct.
according to star_wars_references, jabba's_sail_barge is named the khetanna and was built by ubrikkian_industries as a_pleasure_barge for the_crime_lord.
at 30_m (98 ft) long, ubrikkian_industries is powered by a_repulsorlift_engine to reach a_maximum_speed of 100_km/h (62 mph) but can also use its_two_sails to slowly travel by air_power.
while designed purely as a_pleasure_barge, the_khetanna is fitted with a_laser_cannon_turret and heavy_blasters can be mounted on the_railings.
landspeeder ===
landspeeders are antigravity_vehicles that appear throughout the_films and expanded_universe in both_civilian_and_military_roles.
they appear in star_wars:
episode_iv – a_new_hope.
sandcrawler ===
c-3po (anthony_daniels) and r2-d2 (kenny_baker) are briefly held in a_jawa_sandcrawler in star wars episode iv: a_new_hope.
shots of a_jawa_sandcrawler in star wars episode iv:
a_new_hope at a_distance were actually a_matte_painting; only two of its_treads and a_27-meter-long_piece of its_lower_structure were actually built.
for shots involving the_vehicle's_movement, ilm used a_125-centimeter_radio-controlled_model.
a_computer-generated_sandcrawler briefly appears in the_phantom_menace, and a_sandcrawler also appears in attack of the_clones.
sandcrawler-related_merchandise include a_lego_model, card_game_items, and hasbro_and_micro_machines_toys.
skyhopper ===
an_incom_corporation t-16_skyhopper appears in the_background of the_lars_residence in a_new_hope, and luke_skywalker (mark_hamill) races a_skyhopper in national_public_radio's_radio_adaptation of that_movie; a_skyhopper also appears at the_end of the_special_edition_release of return of the_jedi.
the_skyhopper_model that skywalker handles in a_new_hope is the_concept_model colin_cantwell built; budget_limitations allowed only_a_partial_full-size_mock-up of the_craft to be built.

snowspeeder (t-47_airspeeder) ===
a_t-47_airspeeder, better known as "snowspeeder", is a_rebel_alliance_vehicle featured in the empire strikes back (1980)_andseveral_books, comics, and video_games in star_wars expanded_universe and also in atari_game_cartridges in the 80's.
snowspeeder_models and replicas have been merchandised by several_companies.
origin and designduring production of the empire strikes back, designer_joe_johnston conceived a_ship that combined the_body of an_x-wing and the_cockpit of the_y-wing.
however, this_design was scrapped for the_t-47, which featured no_elements from previous_craft.designer
joe_johnston's_designs for the_snowspeeders have influenced later_star_wars_designers, such as tommy_lee_edwards.
snowspeeder_models and replicas were built in three_different_scales by steve_gawley, charlie_bailey, and mike_fulmer of ilm, with the_smallest_(20_inches) used for motion_control_photography, and the_largest_(2½_feet) for hero_and_pyrotechnic_shots.
snowspeeder_models and replicas included motor-controlled_flaps to imply maneuverability, and the_largest_version also possessed motor-articulated_crew several_full-scale_props were built in london for the_hangar, cockpit, and speeder_crash_scenes.
depictionaccording to background_sources, the_rebel_alliance received a_small_squadron of modified_t-47_airspeeders – aircraft which utilize repulsorlifts to achieve flight – shortly after establishing echo_base on hoth.
these_civilian_speeders, originally meant for retrieving and hauling cargo_sleds with these_civilian_speeders tow_cables, were converted for military_use by bolting on a_pair of laser_cannons with accompanying_power_converters and laser_generator_system.
additional_armor_plating was also added on to increase protection; this_armor was originally carried by y-wing_starfighters but removed by rebel_technicians to ease maintenance.
these_modifications made the_t-47_a_highly_maneuverable_short-range_attack_craft which uses its_speed and agility to avoid being hit.
however, the_intense_environment of hoth initially proved too hostile to these_t-47s as the_cold_temperatures would cause these_t-47s power generators to lock up.
only after rebel_mechanics modified the_heat_radiator_fins at the_back of the_ships to make the_ships less efficient was this_problem resolved and the_ships become more commonly known as snowspeeders.
in the_empire strikes back, rogue_squadron, led by commander_luke_skywalker (mark_hamill), pilots snowspeeders against imperial_at-at_walkers during the_battle of hoth.
however, when the_empire strikes back, rogue squadron, led by commander_luke_skywalker (mark_hamill),_pilots_snowspeeders against imperial_at-at_walkers during the_battle of hoth_weaponry proves incapable of piercing the_assault_walkers'_thick_armoring, luke devises the_unconventional_strategy of using their_tow_cables to entangle the_at-ats.
although luke's_gunner, dak_ralter, is killed before he can try the maneuver himself, wedge_antilles and wes_janson succeed in tripping up an_at-at with their_snowspeeder and destroying their_snowspeeder with a_well-placed_shot to their_snowspeeder neck.
while ultimately the_rebels lose the_battle of hoth, their_snowspeeder earns an_honored_place in the_history_books for the_role their_snowspeeder played.
merchandisekenner released a_toy_snowspeeder in 1980.kenner re-released an_updated_version utilizing the_same_mold in 1995 for their_new_'power of the_force'_line.
after hasbro shut down the_kenner_offices in 1999, hasbro was released several times under hasbro's brand name: in 2001 as a_wal-mart_exclusive in the_"power of the_jedi"_collection, in 2006 as a_target exclusive in the_"saga_collection"_line, and three versions of hasbro in the_2010_"the_vintage_collection", including a_target exclusive packaged as the_original_1980_kenner_version.
lego has also sold snowspeeder_models, and snowspeeder_models used in the empire strikes back have been sold online.
hasbro's_star_wars_transformers_line included a_snowspeeder that transformed into luke_skywalker.
in 2009, japanese_model_manufacturer_fine_molds released a_1/48_scale_kit of a_snowspeeder that transformed into luke_skywalker.
speeder_bike ===
speeder_bikes first appear in a_chase_scene in return of the_jedi and have appeared in various_other_star_wars_media.
related_vehicles called 'swoop bikes' have also appeared in star_wars_films and other_media.==_vehicles appearing in the_prequel_trilogy ==
armored_assault_tank (aat) ===
armored_assault_tank (aat) ==
is a_trade_federation_vehicle that appears in the_phantom_menace, revenge of the_sith, and other_star_wars_media.
early_drafts of the_phantom_menace described the_trade_federation's_invasion of naboo being led by "armored_attack_craft" that resembled helicopters.
george_lucas narrowed down the_aat's_design after looking at two_different_drawings from ilm_design_director doug_chiang - one tank-like and the other shaped like a_flying_spade - and deciding it would be interesting to combine the two together.
the_final_version's_forward_curve is based on the_curve of a_shovel, and parts of it are intended to suggest animalistic_traits.
lego released an_aat_model in 2001.in-universe_reference_material describes the_aat as a_battle_tank designed specifically for head-on_combat, with a_very_heavily-armored_front and a_nose of almost_solid_armor so it can crash through heavy_walls.
first manufactured for the_trade_federation by the_baktoid_armor_workshop, the_aat floats above the_ground thanks to anti-gravity_"repulsorlift"_technology and can achieve a_top_speed of 55_km/h (
34_mph).at_9.75_m (32.0 ft) long, the_aat is crewed by four_battle_droids: a_commander, a_pilot and two_gunners.
up_to_six_additional_battle_droids can use handholds on either_side of the_tank's_body to ride into battle.
it is heavily armed with a_primary_turret-mounted_heavy_laser_cannon; matching pairs of anti-personnel_laser_cannons and laser_rangefinders which extend out either_side on stalks; and two_forward-facing_short-ranged_blaster_cannons in the_tank's_main_body.
the_base of the_tank also incorporates six_energized_projectile_launchers which carry three_main_ammunition_types: "bunker-buster"_high_explosive_shells, armor-piercing_shells and high-energy_shells.
when_fired,_armor-piercing_shells and high-energy_shells are cocooned in high-energy_plasma which reduces air_friction and improves penetration.
in order to reload the_launchers though, the_entire_"foot" of the_aat must be removed and a_loaded_replacement installed using mechanical_facilities.
bongo_submarine ===
the_gungan_"bongo"_submarine is a_transport in the_phantom_menace.
obi-wan_kenobi (ewan_mcgregor),qui-gon_jinn (liam_neeson), and jar_jar_binks (ahmed best)use
the_bongo to travel from the_underwater_city of otah_gunga to the_naboo_capital of theed.
industrial_light_&_magic's_doug_chiang devised the_gungan_"bongo"_submarine's_squid-like_propeller_design.
this_assembly was then merged with the_design for a_manta-shaped_underwater_transport written out of an_earlier_draft of the_story.the_submarine's_squid-like_propeller_design replaced earlier_concepts that depicted the_gungan_vessel as an_organic-looking_diving_bell.
practical_and_cgi_models of the_gungan_vessel were built, as well as a_full-size_set for the_actors to work in.
within the_star_wars_universe, the_bongo is described as being organically grown by secret_gungan_techniques and so no two are exactly alike.
the_submersible piloted by jar-jar, obi-wan and qua-gon was a_tribubble_bongo 15 m(49
ft) long and manufactured by the_otoh_gunga_bongmeken
cooperative.the
gunga_bongmeken_cooperative used hydrostatic_bubble_shields to keep the_cockpit_and_cargo_areas dry and filled with air.
the_cluster of semi-rigid_electromotive_tentacles at the_submersible's_rear could propel the_submersible to a_top_speed of 85_km/h (53_mph).it was unarmed but in an_emergency the_cockpit_section could detach from the_rest of the_submersible as an_escape_pod.
clone_turbo_tank (havw_a6_juggernaut) ===
clone_turbo_tank (havw_a6_juggernaut) ==
is a_ten-wheeled_battle_tank and armored_personnel_carrier that appears in revenge of the_sith and is based on designs done by joe_johnston for use in the empire strikes back.
west_end_games based their_"havw_a5_juggernaut"_design on johnson's_sketches.
the_larger,_more_heavily_armed_vehicle that appears in revenge of the_sith is labeled "havw a6".
the_clone_turbo_tank, more_formally_the_havw_a6_juggernaut, is described in star_wars_sources as being built by kuat_drive_yards to serve as a_heavily_armed_and_armored_military_transport for the_republic during the_clone_wars.
measuring 49.4_m (162_ft)
long, 19.6_m (64 ft) wide and 30.4 m (100 ft)high, the_massive_tank can carry as_many_as_300_clone_troopers into battle depending on internal_configuration.
each of the_juggernaut's_ten_wheels consists of three_independently_spinning_segments and utilize independent_suspension to travel across nearly_any_terrain.
designed to absorb enemy_fire, they help the_massive_tank achieve a_maximum_speed of 160_km/h (99_mph).a_crew of 12 operates the_juggernaut and can control the_massive_tank from cockpits located at either_end of the_massive_tank.the_juggernaut's nearly impregnable armor plating is thermally superconductive to absorb and spread heat over a_wider_area.
for weaponry it is equipped with a_heavy_laser_cannon_turret and rapid-repeating_heavy_laser_cannon_turret on the_roof; two_side-mounted_medium_antipersonnel_laser_cannons that extend out from either_side of the_hull; two_twin_antipersonnel_blaster_cannons under the_'forward'_cockpit; and two_retractable_rocket/grenade_launchers.
after the_end of the_clone_wars, the_massive_tank continues to serve the_galactic_empire.
a_later_model, the_hcvw_a9, appears in rogue one: a_star_wars_story being used as a_prisoner_transport carrying jyn_erso (felicity_jones).corporate_alliance_tank_droid ===
corporate_alliance_tank_droids appear in revenge of the_sith and have appeared in other_star_wars_media, including as playable_vehicles in battlefront_ii.
this_"snail_droid" was originally designed for star_wars: episode_ii – attack of the_clones for the_climatic_battle of geonosis, but they did not make this_"snail_droid" was originally designed for star_wars:
episode_ii – attack of the_clones for the_climatic_battle of geonosis into the_final_cut of the_film.
formally identified in background_material as the_nr-n99_persuader-class_droid_enforcer, these_tanks are manufactured by the_techno_union and primarily used by the_corporate_alliance, which sides with the_separatists during the_clone_wars.
this_10.9_m (36_ft)-long_tank is designed to function on this_10.9_m (36_ft)-long_tank own with a_built-in_droid_brain, though this_10.9_m (36_ft)-long_tank can also be controlled by a_pilot_battle_droid.
consisting of a_huge_central_tread and forward-mounted_outriggers, the_tank_droid can cross almost_any_terrain with ease and achieve a_top_speed of 60_km/h (37_mph).its_weaponry includes two_heavy_repeating_blasters, two_ion_cannons, and missile_launchers.
dwarf_spider_droid ===
the_tank_droid is first seen being used by the_confederacy of independent_systems in attack of the_clones during the_battle of geonosis and have featured in other_star_wars_media.
hasbro released a_spider_droid_figure in 2003.the_dsd1_dwarf_spider_droid, as hasbro is identified in background_material, is essentially a_walking_cannon with a_droid_brain, built by the_baktoid_armor_workshop to fight for the_separatists during the_clone_wars.
standing only_1.9_m(6_ft 3 in) tall, only_1.9_m(6_ft 3 in) is also known as the_burrowing_spider_droid for only_1.9_m(6_ft 3 in) ability to fit in tight spaces.only
1.9_m(6_ft_3_in)_primary_weapon is a_long_blaster_cannon capable of firing at different_intensities and rates of fire, though its_primary_weapon can also willingly utilize a_self-destruct_device to blow up the_enemy.
a_pair of infrared_photoreceptors on the_armored_brain_casing allow the_spider_droid to see the_spider_droid surroundings while four_articulated_legs are designed to affix to the_sides of cliffs so it may climb difficult_terrain.it can achieve a_maximum_speed of 90_km/h (56_mph).===_hmp_droid_gunship ===
droid_gunships appear at the_battle of kashyyyk in revenge of the_sith_and_star_wars: battlefront_ii.their_circular_shape is designed to be reminiscent of the_trade_federation_ships seen in the_phantom_menace.the_trade_federation_ships seen in the_phantom_menace were originally intended to appear in the_movie's_opening_space_battle, but were ultimately depicted as aircraft.
described by in-universe material as the_separatist_counterpart to the_republic's_laat, the_heavy_missile_platform_droid_gunship (or hmp_predator) is a_heavily_armed_repulsorlift_airspeeder which can be adapted for a_wide_range of mission_profiles.
mass-produced by baktoid_fleet_ordnance on numerous_worlds, the_hmp is controlled by an_advanced_droid_brain and measures 12.4 m (41 ft) long, 11 m (36 ft)wide and 3.1 m (10 ft) high.
the_gunship possesses a_top_speed of 600_km/h (370_mph).
however it is considered relatively slow and with average_maneuverability, compensated for by it
ability to unleash incredible_firepower and strong_deflector_shields.it_weaponry can be changed out depending on what's needed, but standard_armament includes a_chin-mounted_medium_laser_cannon, two_twin_laser_cannon_turrets, wingtip-mounted_light_laser_cannons, and fourteen_missiles fitted with variable_payloads including high explosive, emp, incendiary_and_hard_radiation.
the_gunship can also be modified to serve as a_troop_carrier for battle_droids.
flash_speeder ===
the_naboo_royal_security_forces use flash_speeders in the_phantom_menace.
gian_speeder ===
the_naboo_royal_security_forces use gian_speeders in the_phantom_menace.
the_naboo_royal_security_forces are larger,_heavier_counterparts to the_nrsf_flash_speeders, and are used mainly for skirmishes against pirates and smugglers.
however, the_naboo_royal_security_forces are still modified civilian_landspeeeders, and prove relatively useless against trade_federation_tanks.
the_naboo_royal_security_forces are painted purple, carry one_medium_blaster_cannon, and have seating for four_nrsf_officers.
the_naboo_royal_security_forces also have light_armour_plating for protection against hand-held_blasters, but there is little_protection for the_vehicles_occupants.
hailfire_droid_tank ===
hailfire_droids are mobile_missile_platforms that appear in attack of the_clones during the_battle of geonosis and have featured in other_star_wars_media associated with the_clone_wars.
in-universe material identifies them as ig-227 hailfire-class_droid_tanks produced by haor_chall_engineering and commissioned for the_intergalactic_banking_clan prior to the_clone_wars to assist with debt_collection.
standing 6.8 m(22 ft) tall and capable of 45_km/h (28_mph), them consist of two_large_wheels with a_low-fixed_base on which is mounted a_targeting_photoreceptor, twin_chin-mounted_blaster_cannons, and two_missile_launchers.
each_launcher can carry up_to_15_missiles, which have an_effective_range of less_than_one_kilometre following deliberately_evasive_trajectories to them target.
although an_effective_platform against both_ground_and_air_targets, the_hailfire was phased out during the_clone_wars because of the_hailfire limited ammunition supply.
homing spider_droid ===
the_droid appears in attack of the_clones during the_battle of geonosis and features in other_star_wars_media, including as a_playable_vehicle in battlefront_ii.during_post-production, the_droid was referred to as "commerce_guild_droid_b.
referred to in source_material as the_droid, these_droid_walking_tanks were manufactured by baktoid_armor_workshop for commerce_guild to enforce commerce_guild contracts.
baktoid_armor_workshop for the_commerce_guild consists of an_armored_reactor_core_body attached to four_armored_legs, giving baktoid_armor_workshop for the_commerce_guild a_height of 7.3_m (24_ft).
while four_armored_legs are thin four_armored_legs are tougher than four_armored_legs look, allowing the_droid to traverse nearly_any_terrain and achieve a_top_speed of 90_km/h (56 mph).
baktoid_armor_workshop for the_commerce_guild_primary_weapons are two_dish-shaped_laser_cannons mounted on the top and bottom of the_reactor_core: the_top-mounted_cannon primarily releases sustains bursts to wear down deflector_shields, while the_bottom_cannon suppresses enemy_infantry.
multi-troop_transport (mtt) ===
the_multi-troop_transports or mtts made the_multi-troop_transports or mtts first appearance in the_phantom_menace, carrying and deploying trade_federation_battle_droids during the_invasion of naboo.
as with the_aat, parts of the_mtt are intended to suggest animalistic_traits.
lucas requested the_mtt have locomotive-type_qualities and be capable of knocking down everything in the_mtt path; consequently, the_mtt has battering rams and locomotive_components.
although the_mtt was primarily created using computer-generated_imagery (cgi), a_scale_model was also built to film certain_scenes of the_phantom_menace, combining elements of practical_and_digital_special_effects.
fictional_background for the_mtt explains the_mtt was originally produced by baktoid_armor_workshop, the_same_manufacturer of the_trade_federation's_aat.
measuring 31_m
(102 ft) long and 3_m (9.8_ft)
tall, the_mtt is designed to deploy in traditional_battle_lines, hence the_mtt strong frontal armor.
although floating above the_ground on heavy-duty_repulsorlift"_engines, the_mtt is a_lumbering_vehicle with a_top_speed of only_35_km/h_(22_mph).a_crew of five_battle_droids operate the_mtt and it is armed with a_pair of twin_17kv_antipersonnel_blaster_cannons, but it_primary_purpose is to carry 112_battle_droids into battle.
these are stored folded-up on an_articulated_deployment_rack, which extends forward out of the_mtt's_bulbous_front_end via troop_deployment_hatch.
during the_clone_wars, mtts were modified to carry larger_super_battle_droids as well.===_podracer ===
podracers are high-speed_one-man_race_craft.
anakin_skywalker (jake_lloyd) enters and wins a_podrace in the_phantom_menace.
the_phantom_menace consists of forward_turbines attached loosely to the_cockpit by a_series of cables with the_turbines attached to each other by an_ion_beam.
the_phantom_menace was frequently gambled upon and was considered by many, including qui-gon_jinn, to be a_dangerous_sport.
the_video_gamesi: racer, star_wars: racer arcade and star_wars racer revenge are based on the_phantom_menace's_podracing_scenes.
republic_assault_gunboat ===
the_republic_assault_gunboat appears in revenge of the_sith.
the_republic_assault_gunboat went through several_changes over the_course of the_republic_assault_gunboat development:the_republic_assault_gunboat was originally a_confederacy_capital_ship, then became the_"good_guy_a"_support_ship for the_republic.
the_republic_assault_gunboat became a_confederacy_ship once more before being scaled down, turned into a_speeder, and becoming a_republic_craft.
republic_laat_gunship ===
the_low-altitude_assault_transports (laats) are galactic_republic_airborne_attack_transport and multirole-ground_attack_gunships that appears in attack of the_clones, revenge of the_sith
,_star_wars:
the_clone_wars, star_wars: battlefront, and star_wars: republic_commando, ferrying clone_troopers, jedi, and military_hardware during battle.
the_expanded_universe describes the_laat as a_versatile_multi-role_aerospace_crafts capable of reconfigured for the_gunship, transport, starfighter, and bomber_combat_roles.
there are numerous_laat_variants: the_laat/i_infantry_transport, the_laat/c_cargo_carrier, the_laat/s_stealth_special_forces, the_laat/le_law_enforcement for military_police, and laat/v_vehicle_tactical_airlift that carried at-tes.
lucas turned to footage of helicopter-troop_deployment when conceiving the_laat; laat/v_vehicle was originally labeled the "jedi attack
helicopter".
laat/v_vehicle's_ultimate_appearance is based on the_russian_mil_mi-24_helicopter.
the_craft's_engine_sounds are the_modified_sound of a_vickers_vimy, a_world_war_i_bomber.
both_hasbro and lego released laat_models in 2002; lego released another_laat in 2008.code 3_collectibles released a_die-cast_gunship two years later.
within the_star_wars_universe, these_repulsorlift_gunships were built by rothana_heavy_engineering to serve a_vital_role as atmospheric_transports and escorts for the_republic during the_clone_wars.
the_standard_laat/i_gunship (low_altitude_assault_transport/infantry), measuring 17.4_m (57_ft)_long_(clearance with guns) and 6.1_m (20 ft)deep with a_17_m_(56_ft)_wingspan, can carry a_platoon of 30_clone_troopers with storage_racks for several_speeder_bikes.
with a_maximum_air_speed of 620_km/h (390 mph), the_laat was designed specifically with low-atmosphere_flight in mind, giving the_laat an_advantage engaging enemy_starfighters which give up their_speed_advantage when fighting below mountain_level.
later_models however were adapted to allow short_trips in deep_space.
the_gunship's_weaponry includes three_antipersonnel_laser_cannons on swivel_turrets, two forward and one_rear; four_composite-beam_laser_turrets, two mounted on the_wings and two on ball_turrets extending from either_side; two_mass_driver_missile_launchers which can accelerate a_variety of missiles at up to hypersonic_velocities; and eight light air-to-air rockets carried on underwing_hardpoints.i is crewed by a_pilot, copilot/gunner, and two auxiliary turret gunners.underwing_hardpoints.i also carries a_variety of emergency_supplies, including an_im-6_battlefield_medical_droid, collapsible_repulsor_stretchers, and inflatable_decontamination_tents.
another_variant, the_laat/c_(low_altitude_assault_transport/carrier), is crewed by a_single_pilot and armed with just_the_nose-mounted_cannons, but features a_pair of magnetic_clamps that can quickly ferry cargo or at-tes into battle.
self-propelled_heavy_artillery (spha) ===
self-propelled_heavy_artillery first appear in attack of the_clones during the_battle of geonosis.
the_vehicle was initially designed on treads, but george_lucas suggested that the_vehicle be equipped with legs like the at-tes that fight alongside the_vehicle.
the_spha was referred to as "clone_tank_a" during production.
source_material identifies the_spha as one of the_biggest_ground_guns in the_republic's_arsenals during the_clone_wars, operated by a_crew of 30_clone_troopers.
at 140.2_m (460 ft) long, the_spha is slow but steady, reaching speeds of up_to_35_km/h (22_mph) on 12_articulate_legs though the_spha must remain stationary to fire the_spha weapon.
the_spha is armed with a_heavy_turbolaser_cannon powerful enough to destroy a_starship, though firing the_spha requires vast_amounts of energy which can quickly drainthe spha-t.single_trooper_aerial_platform (stap) ===
staps, which first appeared in the_phantom_menace and have featured in other_star_wars_media, are designed to appear reminiscent of the_speeder_bikes seen in return of the_jedi.
the_stap's_design also relates back to lucas'_1973_idea of ridable_"jet-sticks" which appeared in early_drafts of the_original_star_wars_movie.
a_draft of the_phantom_menace refers to the_vehicles as staps, or single_troop_armed_pogo sticks.the_vehicles as staps, or single_troop_armed_pogo sticks are based in-universe on civilian_vehicles called airhooks, modified for greater_performance and to be piloted by the_trade_federation's_battle_droids.
floating above the_ground thanks to "repulsorlift"_technology, a_pair of drive_turbines on either_side of the_vertical_stem gives it impressive_speed and maneuverability.
though armed with a_pair of blaster_cannons, the_stap leaves the_stap pilot completely exposed, making the_stap ill-suit for heavy_battle.
swamp_speeder ===
swamp_speeders appear in revenge of the_sith during battle_scenes on felucia and kashyyyk.
tj_frame, who worked on the_swamp_speeder concept soon after joining the_art_department, initially designed the_craft to be appear reminiscent of fanboats.
within the star wars universe these_vehicles are known as infantry support platform (isp) speeders, built for the_republic during the_clone_wars by uulshos_manufacturing.
isps use repulsorlifts and a_powerful_turbofan to patrol swampy_regions, leading to isps nickname, although isps can be used on almost_any_terrain.
operated by two_clone_troopers and armed with a_pair of twin_swiveling_blaster_cannons, the_isp can move at speeds of up_to_100_km/h (62_mph).wheel_bike ===
general_grievous rides a_wheel_bike in revenge of the_sith during general_grievous confrontation with obi-wan_kenobi
(ewan_mcgregor).grievous'_vehicle is similar to another_wheel_bike that appears in the_star_wars
:droids_cartoon.
one_concept for general_grievous_vehicle was for one_concept for grievous'_vehicle to include "tank-like_chariots"; at another_point, grievous'_vehicle was going to be another_droid.
grievous'_wheel_bike is identified in star_wars_source_material as a_tsmeu-6_personal_wheel_bike built by the_z-gomot_ternbuell_guppat_corporation.
wheel_bikes are described as being primarily used during mining_operations, however wheel_bikes are also popular as modified_weapons_platforms on the_second-hand_market.
the_tsmeu-6 is 3.5_m (11 ft)long with a_wheel_diameter of 2.5_m (8 ft 2 in) and four retractable legs for navigating difficult_terrain.
with the_legs retracted the_wheel_bike has a_maximum_speed of 330_km/h (210_mph), while in walking_mode the_bike can only attain
10_km/h (6.2_mph).the_bike has enough_fuel to travel 500_km (310 mi).while normally carrying a_driver and passenger
, grevious'_bike has had the_passenger_seat replaced with a_heavy_double_laser_cannon; both_seat and cannon remain stable while the_wheel rotates around seat and cannon.
wookiee_flying_catamaran ===
wookiee_flying_catamarans appear in revenge of the_sith.
wookiee_flying_catamarans were originally conceived as strictly_water_vehicles.
the_addition of a_rotor came late in production; some_printed_works do not depict this_component.
wookiee_ornithopter ==
wookiee_ornithopters appear in revenge of the_sith.
the_craft was originally known as the_"dragonfly_helicopter".
although mostly depicted through computer-generated_imagery, a_full-size_mockup of the_gunner's_seat was created for a_closeup of the_tail_gunner.==_vehicles appearing in other_star_wars_media ==
imperial_assault_tank ===
imperial_assault_tank
=== is a_ground_vehicle which made imperial_assault_tank ===_theatrical_debut in rogue one: a_star_wars_story patrolling the_streets of jedha's_old_city and has appeared in other_media including star_wars_rebels.
the_life-sized_model which appeared on the_rogueone_set was based on a_heavily_modified_flatbed alvis_stormer piloted by experienced_tank_operators.
although imperial_assault_tank === had initially been intended to be a_hover_vehicle, imperial_assault_tank === was decided to keep the_treads after production.
official_sources identify the_vehicle as the_tx-225_"occupier"_combat_assault_tank manufactured by rothana_heavy_engineering for the_galactic_empire.
measuring 7.3_m (24 ft)long and 1.82 m (6 ft 0 in)
high, the_vehicle can reach a_top_speed of 72_km/h (45_mph) on open_roads and is crewed by a_tank_commander, driver, and gunner/technician.
its_armament includes a_pair of elevating twin_dymek_mk2e/w_medium_laser_cannons for antiarmor_&_antiaircraft_use and a_forward-locked_twin_dymek_mk_2e/w_medium_laser_cannon for antipersonnel_use.
composite_laminate_armoring makes the_tank remarkably resilient without overtaxing composite_laminate_armoring propulsion system.
two_variants of the_"occupier" are employed by the_empire: the_standard_tx-225_gavw utilizing a_continuous_track which makes it highly maneuverable in urban_environments, and the_tx-225_gavr which hovers slightly above the_ground on repulsorlifts.

following is a_list of fictional_star_wars_terrestrial_vehicles, including armoured_fighting_vehicles, military_aircraft, and naval_ships.==_vehicles appearing in the_original_trilogy ==
all_terrain_armored_transport (at-at) ===
the_all_terrain_armored_transport, or at-at_walker, is a_quadruped_mechanized_infantry_combat_vehicle used by the_imperial_ground_forces.
standing over 20 metres (66_ft) tall with blast-impervious_armour_plating, these_massive_constructs are used as much for psychological_effect as these_massive_constructs are for tactical_advantage.
the_at-at (pronounced either casually as 'at at', or  using only_the_letters_'a.t._a.t.') was first introduced in the empire strikes back (as the_galactic_empire's_main_units against rebel_alliance_infantry during the_battle of hoth) and also appears in return of the_jedi (as a_quadruped_mechanized_infantry_combat_vehicle used by the_imperial_ground_forces used to transport luke_skywalker and darth_vader to luke_skywalker and darth_vader shuttle on the_forest_moon of endor) and in rogue_one (in the_at-act_variant, used to respond to the_attacks of rebel_infantrymen of the rogue_one unit during the_battle of scarif, although later defeated by the_arriving_rebel_red_squadron of starfighers).the
at-at also appears in a_destroyed_form in star_wars:
the force awakens, explained in the_video_game star_wars_battlefront (2015) to be a_residue of the_battle of jakku, which was the galactic empire's's last_defeat and resulted in empire_dissolution.
modified_forms appear in the_last_jedi (used by the_first_order to attack resistance_forces in a_former_rebel_base).
all_terrain_scout_transport (at-st) ===
the all_terrain_scout_transport (at-st) is a_two-legged_mech_walker introduced briefly in the empire strikes back and featured extensively in return of the_jedi.
these_vehicles were designed to screen and protect the_flanks of slower moving at-ats and the_larger_tanks used by the_empire.
due to these_vehicles_design and movement, these_vehicles are often dubbed as a_"chicken
the_name_scout_walker is also used to refer to an_at-st.this_name was used for the_official_toy instead of the_at-st_name.
an_at-st also appears briefly in rogue one: a_star_wars_story, patrolling jedha_city following an_attack by saw_gerrera's_forces.
a_modified_at-st later appears in the_mandalorian under the_possession of a_group of raiders, as the_empire has ceased to exist by the_time of the_series.
an_updated_model of the_at-st is used by the_first_order in the_jedi.
shortly before the_film's_climax, an_at-st is commandeered by bb-8.cloud_car ===
cloud_cars fly around bespin's_cloud_city in the_empire strikes back and return of the_jedi.
compositing the_cloud_cars into the_original_releases required multiple_motion_control passes to prevent the_vehicles from standing out too distinctly from the_vehicles cloudy_background.
cloud_cars were designed to have two_cockpits that were interconnected with a_small_compartment_block.
it was often a_red-orange_color with each_cockpit arranged in a_"shoe-shape" with the_glass being on the_"tongue" of the_cockpit.
like the_rest of cloud_city, cloud_cars were designed to reflect a_more_refined_art_deco_style.
the_scale_models originally created for the_movies were made of plastic_parts using the_then-new_method of vacuum forming.
cloud_cars inserted into the_films'_special_edition_releases were computer-generated.
within the_star_wars_universe, cloud_cars were built by bespin_motors specifically as atmospheric_patrol
craft.the_vehicles consist of two_separate_pods connected together, one for a_pilot and the other for a_gunner.the_vehicles can achieve low_orbit and attain speeds of 1,500_km/h (930_mph) thanks to a_combination of repulsorlift_drive and ion_engine.
each_pod is armed with a_light_blaster_cannon and protected with armor_plating and an_armored_canopy.
while normally the port-side pod houses the_pilot_and_starboard-side_housesthe_gunner, both_pods contain all_the_equipment necessary to fulfill either_role in the_event one is damaged.
desert_skiff ===
a_pair of skiffs travel with jabba's_sail_barge in return of the_jedi.
desert_skiff === was originally conceived as a_flying_animal carrying strapped-on_passenger_modules.
desert_skiff === was modified to be a_nautical-type_vehicle, and then transitioned to become more utilitarian.
a_full-size_skiff was built alongside the_sail_barge in yuma.
an_81-centimeter_miniature was also built, and an_81-centimeter_miniature was "crewed" by poseable_puppets.
skiffs are a_common_mode of transport on many_star_wars_worlds as per in-universe sources, utilizing repulsorlift_technology to move cargo and passengers on the_cheap.
the_bantha_ii-cargo_skiffs seen in return of the_jedi the_jedi are also a_favorite of various_criminal_organizations, which use the_bantha_ii-cargo_skiffs seen in return of the_jedi for raids and prisoner_exchanges.
built by ubrikkian_industries, the_bantha_ii-cargo_skiffs seen in return of the_jedi are 9.5_m (31 ft) long, with an_armored_bow to withstand head-on_collisions, and can reach speeds of 250_km/h (160 mph).
jabba's_sail_barge (khetanna) ===
a_sail_barge delivers jabba the_hutt and his_entourage to the_sarlacc_pit in return of the_jedi.
illustrator_ralph_mcquarrie designed the_ship to appear more utilitarian in comparison to early_designs, which made the_ship reminiscent of a_baroque_sea_craft.
joe_johnston continued working on the_design after illustrator_ralph_mcquarrie stepped away from the_project.
a 30,000-square-foot (2,800 m2) full-scale sail barge set was erected in yuma, arizona; it was one of the_largest_star_wars_sets created.
measuring 150 feet long, 130 feet wide and 65 feet high, the sail barge set was supported by 130_wooden_posts, each 27 feet high, which were deeply embedded into the_ground.
underneath the_bargewere_several_offices and a_commissary which could feed 150_people.
in order to get to the_set, a_two-mile_road made of compacted_sand was built, requiring roughly_80,000_gallons of water to construct.
according to star_wars_references, jabba's_sail_barge is named the khetanna and was built by ubrikkian_industries as a_pleasure_barge for the_crime_lord.
at 30_m (98 ft) long, ubrikkian_industries is powered by a_repulsorlift_engine to reach a_maximum_speed of 100_km/h (62 mph) but can also use its_two_sails to slowly travel by air_power.
while designed purely as a_pleasure_barge, the_khetanna is fitted with a_laser_cannon_turret and heavy_blasters can be mounted on the_railings.
landspeeder ===
landspeeders are antigravity_vehicles that appear throughout the_films and expanded_universe in both_civilian_and_military_roles.
they appear in star_wars:
episode_iv – a_new_hope.
sandcrawler ===
c-3po (anthony_daniels) and r2-d2 (kenny_baker) are briefly held in a_jawa_sandcrawler in star wars episode iv: a_new_hope.
shots of a_jawa_sandcrawler in star wars episode iv:
a_new_hope at a_distance were actually a_matte_painting; only two of its_treads and a_27-meter-long_piece of its_lower_structure were actually built.
for shots involving the_vehicle's_movement, ilm used a_125-centimeter_radio-controlled_model.
a_computer-generated_sandcrawler briefly appears in the_phantom_menace, and a_sandcrawler also appears in attack of the_clones.
sandcrawler-related_merchandise include a_lego_model, card_game_items, and hasbro_and_micro_machines_toys.
skyhopper ===
an_incom_corporation t-16_skyhopper appears in the_background of the_lars_residence in a_new_hope, and luke_skywalker (mark_hamill) races a_skyhopper in national_public_radio's_radio_adaptation of that_movie; a_skyhopper also appears at the_end of the_special_edition_release of return of the_jedi.
the_skyhopper_model that skywalker handles in a_new_hope is the_concept_model colin_cantwell built; budget_limitations allowed only_a_partial_full-size_mock-up of the_craft to be built.
in star_wars: rebel_assault, skyhoppers are used by rebel_pilots to train in tatooine's_beggar's_canyon.
snowspeeder (t-47_airspeeder) ===
a_t-47_airspeeder, better known as "snowspeeder", is a_rebel_alliance_vehicle featured in the empire strikes back (1980)_andseveral_books, comics, and video_games in star_wars expanded_universe and also in atari_game_cartridges in the 80's.
snowspeeder_models and replicas have been merchandised by several_companies.
origin and designduring production of the empire strikes back, designer_joe_johnston conceived a_ship that combined the_body of an_x-wing and the_cockpit of the_y-wing.
however, this_design was scrapped for the_t-47, which featured no_elements from previous_craft.designer
joe_johnston's_designs for the_snowspeeders have influenced later_star_wars_designers, such as tommy_lee_edwards.
snowspeeder_models and replicas were built in three_different_scales by steve_gawley, charlie_bailey, and mike_fulmer of ilm, with the_smallest_(20_inches) used for motion_control_photography, and the_largest_(2½_feet) for hero_and_pyrotechnic_shots.
snowspeeder_models and replicas included motor-controlled_flaps to imply maneuverability, and the_largest_version also possessed motor-articulated_crew several_full-scale_props were built in london for the_hangar, cockpit, and speeder_crash_scenes.
depictionaccording to background_sources, the_rebel_alliance received a_small_squadron of modified_t-47_airspeeders – aircraft which utilize repulsorlifts to achieve flight – shortly after establishing echo_base on hoth.
these_civilian_speeders, originally meant for retrieving and hauling cargo_sleds with these_civilian_speeders tow_cables, were converted for military_use by bolting on a_pair of laser_cannons with accompanying_power_converters and laser_generator_system.
additional_armor_plating was also added on to increase protection; this_armor was originally carried by y-wing_starfighters but removed by rebel_technicians to ease maintenance.
these_modifications made the_t-47_a_highly_maneuverable_short-range_attack_craft which uses its_speed and agility to avoid being hit.
however, the_intense_environment of hoth initially proved too hostile to these_t-47s as the_cold_temperatures would cause these_t-47s power generators to lock up.
only after rebel_mechanics modified the_heat_radiator_fins at the_back of the_ships to make the_ships less efficient was this_problem resolved and the_ships become more commonly known as snowspeeders.
in the_empire strikes back, rogue_squadron, led by commander_luke_skywalker (mark_hamill), pilots snowspeeders against imperial_at-at_walkers during the_battle of hoth.
however, when the_empire strikes back, rogue squadron, led by commander_luke_skywalker (mark_hamill),_pilots_snowspeeders against imperial_at-at_walkers during the_battle of hoth_weaponry proves incapable of piercing the_assault_walkers'_thick_armoring, luke devises the_unconventional_strategy of using their_tow_cables to entangle the_at-ats.
although luke's_gunner, dak_ralter, is killed before he can try the maneuver himself, wedge_antilles and wes_janson succeed in tripping up an_at-at with their_snowspeeder and destroying their_snowspeeder with a_well-placed_shot to their_snowspeeder neck.
while ultimately the_rebels lose the_battle of hoth, their_snowspeeder earns an_honored_place in the_history_books for the_role their_snowspeeder played.
merchandisekenner released a_toy_snowspeeder in 1980.kenner re-released an_updated_version utilizing the_same_mold in 1995 for their_new_'power of the_force'_line.
after hasbro shut down the_kenner_offices in 1999, hasbro was released several times under hasbro's brand name: in 2001 as a_wal-mart_exclusive in the_"power of the_jedi"_collection, in 2006 as a_target exclusive in the_"saga_collection"_line, and three versions of hasbro in the_2010_"the_vintage_collection", including a_target exclusive packaged as the_original_1980_kenner_version.
lego has also sold snowspeeder_models, and snowspeeder_models used in the empire strikes back have been sold online.
hasbro's_star_wars_transformers_line included a_snowspeeder that transformed into luke_skywalker.
in 2009, japanese_model_manufacturer_fine_molds released a_1/48_scale_kit of a_snowspeeder that transformed into luke_skywalker.
speeder_bike ===
speeder_bikes first appear in a_chase_scene in return of the_jedi and have appeared in various_other_star_wars_media.
related_vehicles called 'swoop bikes' have also appeared in star_wars_films and other_media.==_vehicles appearing in the_prequel_trilogy ==
armored_assault_tank (aat) ===
armored_assault_tank (aat) ==
is a_trade_federation_vehicle that appears in the_phantom_menace, revenge of the_sith, and other_star_wars_media.
early_drafts of the_phantom_menace described the_trade_federation's_invasion of naboo being led by "armored_attack_craft" that resembled helicopters.
george_lucas narrowed down the_aat's_design after looking at two_different_drawings from ilm_design_director doug_chiang - one tank-like and the other shaped like a_flying_spade - and deciding it would be interesting to combine the two together.
the_final_version's_forward_curve is based on the_curve of a_shovel, and parts of it are intended to suggest animalistic_traits.
lego released an_aat_model in 2001.in-universe_reference_material describes the_aat as a_battle_tank designed specifically for head-on_combat, with a_very_heavily-armored_front and a_nose of almost_solid_armor so it can crash through heavy_walls.
first manufactured for the_trade_federation by the_baktoid_armor_workshop, the_aat floats above the_ground thanks to anti-gravity_"repulsorlift"_technology and can achieve a_top_speed of 55_km/h (
34_mph).at_9.75_m (32.0 ft) long, the_aat is crewed by four_battle_droids: a_commander, a_pilot and two_gunners.
up_to_six_additional_battle_droids can use handholds on either_side of the_tank's_body to ride into battle.
it is heavily armed with a_primary_turret-mounted_heavy_laser_cannon; matching pairs of anti-personnel_laser_cannons and laser_rangefinders which extend out either_side on stalks; and two_forward-facing_short-ranged_blaster_cannons in the_tank's_main_body.
the_base of the_tank also incorporates six_energized_projectile_launchers which carry three_main_ammunition_types: "bunker-buster"_high_explosive_shells, armor-piercing_shells and high-energy_shells.
when_fired,_armor-piercing_shells and high-energy_shells are cocooned in high-energy_plasma which reduces air_friction and improves penetration.
in order to reload the_launchers though, the_entire_"foot" of the_aat must be removed and a_loaded_replacement installed using mechanical_facilities.
bongo_submarine ===
the_gungan_"bongo"_submarine is a_transport in the_phantom_menace.
obi-wan_kenobi (ewan_mcgregor),qui-gon_jinn (liam_neeson), and jar_jar_binks (ahmed best)use
the_bongo to travel from the_underwater_city of otah_gunga to the_naboo_capital of theed.
industrial_light_&_magic's_doug_chiang devised the_gungan_"bongo"_submarine's_squid-like_propeller_design.
this_assembly was then merged with the_design for a_manta-shaped_underwater_transport written out of an_earlier_draft of the_story.the_submarine's_squid-like_propeller_design replaced earlier_concepts that depicted the_gungan_vessel as an_organic-looking_diving_bell.
practical_and_cgi_models of the_gungan_vessel were built, as well as a_full-size_set for the_actors to work in.
within the_star_wars_universe, the_bongo is described as being organically grown by secret_gungan_techniques and so no two are exactly alike.
the_submersible piloted by jar-jar, obi-wan and qua-gon was a_tribubble_bongo 15 m(49
ft) long and manufactured by the_otoh_gunga_bongmeken
cooperative.the
gunga_bongmeken_cooperative used hydrostatic_bubble_shields to keep the_cockpit_and_cargo_areas dry and filled with air.
the_cluster of semi-rigid_electromotive_tentacles at the_submersible's_rear could propel the_submersible to a_top_speed of 85_km/h (53_mph).it was unarmed but in an_emergency the_cockpit_section could detach from the_rest of the_submersible as an_escape_pod.
clone_turbo_tank (havw_a6_juggernaut) ===
clone_turbo_tank (havw_a6_juggernaut) ==
is a_ten-wheeled_battle_tank and armored_personnel_carrier that appears in revenge of the_sith and is based on designs done by joe_johnston for use in the empire strikes back.
west_end_games based their_"havw_a5_juggernaut"_design on johnson's_sketches.
the_larger,_more_heavily_armed_vehicle that appears in revenge of the_sith is labeled "havw a6".
the_clone_turbo_tank, more_formally_the_havw_a6_juggernaut, is described in star_wars_sources as being built by kuat_drive_yards to serve as a_heavily_armed_and_armored_military_transport for the_republic during the_clone_wars.
measuring 49.4_m (162_ft)
long, 19.6_m (64 ft) wide and 30.4 m (100 ft)high, the_massive_tank can carry as_many_as_300_clone_troopers into battle depending on internal_configuration.
each of the_juggernaut's_ten_wheels consists of three_independently_spinning_segments and utilize independent_suspension to travel across nearly_any_terrain.
designed to absorb enemy_fire, they help the_massive_tank achieve a_maximum_speed of 160_km/h (99_mph).a_crew of 12 operates the_juggernaut and can control the_massive_tank from cockpits located at either_end of the_massive_tank.the_juggernaut's nearly impregnable armor plating is thermally superconductive to absorb and spread heat over a_wider_area.
for weaponry it is equipped with a_heavy_laser_cannon_turret and rapid-repeating_heavy_laser_cannon_turret on the_roof; two_side-mounted_medium_antipersonnel_laser_cannons that extend out from either_side of the_hull; two_twin_antipersonnel_blaster_cannons under the_'forward'_cockpit; and two_retractable_rocket/grenade_launchers.
after the_end of the_clone_wars, the_massive_tank continues to serve the_galactic_empire.
a_later_model, the_hcvw_a9, appears in rogue one: a_star_wars_story being used as a_prisoner_transport carrying jyn_erso (felicity_jones).corporate_alliance_tank_droid ===
corporate_alliance_tank_droids appear in revenge of the_sith and have appeared in other_star_wars_media, including as playable_vehicles in battlefront_ii.
this_"snail_droid" was originally designed for star_wars: episode_ii – attack of the_clones for the_climatic_battle of geonosis, but they did not make this_"snail_droid" was originally designed for star_wars:
episode_ii – attack of the_clones for the_climatic_battle of geonosis into the_final_cut of the_film.
formally identified in background_material as the_nr-n99_persuader-class_droid_enforcer, these_tanks are manufactured by the_techno_union and primarily used by the_corporate_alliance, which sides with the_separatists during the_clone_wars.
this_10.9_m (36_ft)-long_tank is designed to function on this_10.9_m (36_ft)-long_tank own with a_built-in_droid_brain, though this_10.9_m (36_ft)-long_tank can also be controlled by a_pilot_battle_droid.
consisting of a_huge_central_tread and forward-mounted_outriggers, the_tank_droid can cross almost_any_terrain with ease and achieve a_top_speed of 60_km/h (37_mph).its_weaponry includes two_heavy_repeating_blasters, two_ion_cannons, and missile_launchers.
dwarf_spider_droid ===
the_tank_droid is first seen being used by the_confederacy of independent_systems in attack of the_clones during the_battle of geonosis and have featured in other_star_wars_media.
hasbro released a_spider_droid_figure in 2003.the_dsd1_dwarf_spider_droid, as hasbro is identified in background_material, is essentially a_walking_cannon with a_droid_brain, built by the_baktoid_armor_workshop to fight for the_separatists during the_clone_wars.
standing only_1.9_m(6_ft 3 in) tall, only_1.9_m(6_ft 3 in) is also known as the_burrowing_spider_droid for only_1.9_m(6_ft 3 in) ability to fit in tight spaces.only
1.9_m(6_ft_3_in)_primary_weapon is a_long_blaster_cannon capable of firing at different_intensities and rates of fire, though its_primary_weapon can also willingly utilize a_self-destruct_device to blow up the_enemy.
a_pair of infrared_photoreceptors on the_armored_brain_casing allow the_spider_droid to see the_spider_droid surroundings while four_articulated_legs are designed to affix to the_sides of cliffs so it may climb difficult_terrain.it can achieve a_maximum_speed of 90_km/h (56_mph).===_hmp_droid_gunship ===
droid_gunships appear at the_battle of kashyyyk in revenge of the_sith_and_star_wars: battlefront_ii.their_circular_shape is designed to be reminiscent of the_trade_federation_ships seen in the_phantom_menace.the_trade_federation_ships seen in the_phantom_menace were originally intended to appear in the_movie's_opening_space_battle, but were ultimately depicted as aircraft.
described by in-universe material as the_separatist_counterpart to the_republic's_laat, the_heavy_missile_platform_droid_gunship (or hmp_predator) is a_heavily_armed_repulsorlift_airspeeder which can be adapted for a_wide_range of mission_profiles.
mass-produced by baktoid_fleet_ordnance on numerous_worlds, the_hmp is controlled by an_advanced_droid_brain and measures 12.4 m (41 ft) long, 11 m (36 ft)wide and 3.1 m (10 ft) high.
the_gunship possesses a_top_speed of 600_km/h (370_mph).
however it is considered relatively slow and with average_maneuverability, compensated for by it
ability to unleash incredible_firepower and strong_deflector_shields.it_weaponry can be changed out depending on what's needed, but standard_armament includes a_chin-mounted_medium_laser_cannon, two_twin_laser_cannon_turrets, wingtip-mounted_light_laser_cannons, and fourteen_missiles fitted with variable_payloads including high explosive, emp, incendiary_and_hard_radiation.
the_gunship can also be modified to serve as a_troop_carrier for battle_droids.
flash_speeder ===
the_naboo_royal_security_forces use flash_speeders in the_phantom_menace.
gian_speeder ===
the_naboo_royal_security_forces use gian_speeders in the_phantom_menace.
the_naboo_royal_security_forces are larger,_heavier_counterparts to the_nrsf_flash_speeders, and are used mainly for skirmishes against pirates and smugglers.
however, the_naboo_royal_security_forces are still modified civilian_landspeeeders, and prove relatively useless against trade_federation_tanks.
the_naboo_royal_security_forces are painted purple, carry one_medium_blaster_cannon, and have seating for four_nrsf_officers.
the_naboo_royal_security_forces also have light_armour_plating for protection against hand-held_blasters, but there is little_protection for the_vehicles_occupants.
hailfire_droid_tank ===
hailfire_droids are mobile_missile_platforms that appear in attack of the_clones during the_battle of geonosis and have featured in other_star_wars_media associated with the_clone_wars.
in-universe material identifies them as ig-227 hailfire-class_droid_tanks produced by haor_chall_engineering and commissioned for the_intergalactic_banking_clan prior to the_clone_wars to assist with debt_collection.
standing 6.8 m(22 ft) tall and capable of 45_km/h (28_mph), them consist of two_large_wheels with a_low-fixed_base on which is mounted a_targeting_photoreceptor, twin_chin-mounted_blaster_cannons, and two_missile_launchers.
each_launcher can carry up_to_15_missiles, which have an_effective_range of less_than_one_kilometre following deliberately_evasive_trajectories to them target.
although an_effective_platform against both_ground_and_air_targets, the_hailfire was phased out during the_clone_wars because of the_hailfire limited ammunition supply.
homing spider_droid ===
the_droid appears in attack of the_clones during the_battle of geonosis and features in other_star_wars_media, including as a_playable_vehicle in battlefront_ii.during_post-production, the_droid was referred to as "commerce_guild_droid_b.
referred to in source_material as the_droid, these_droid_walking_tanks were manufactured by baktoid_armor_workshop for commerce_guild to enforce commerce_guild contracts.
baktoid_armor_workshop for the_commerce_guild consists of an_armored_reactor_core_body attached to four_armored_legs, giving baktoid_armor_workshop for the_commerce_guild a_height of 7.3_m (24_ft).
while four_armored_legs are thin four_armored_legs are tougher than four_armored_legs look, allowing the_droid to traverse nearly_any_terrain and achieve a_top_speed of 90_km/h (56 mph).
baktoid_armor_workshop for the_commerce_guild_primary_weapons are two_dish-shaped_laser_cannons mounted on the top and bottom of the_reactor_core: the_top-mounted_cannon primarily releases sustains bursts to wear down deflector_shields, while the_bottom_cannon suppresses enemy_infantry.
multi-troop_transport (mtt) ===
the_multi-troop_transports or mtts made the_multi-troop_transports or mtts first appearance in the_phantom_menace, carrying and deploying trade_federation_battle_droids during the_invasion of naboo.
as with the_aat, parts of the_mtt are intended to suggest animalistic_traits.
lucas requested the_mtt have locomotive-type_qualities and be capable of knocking down everything in the_mtt path; consequently, the_mtt has battering rams and locomotive_components.
although the_mtt was primarily created using computer-generated_imagery (cgi), a_scale_model was also built to film certain_scenes of the_phantom_menace, combining elements of practical_and_digital_special_effects.
fictional_background for the_mtt explains the_mtt was originally produced by baktoid_armor_workshop, the_same_manufacturer of the_trade_federation's_aat.
measuring 31_m
(102 ft) long and 3_m (9.8_ft)
tall, the_mtt is designed to deploy in traditional_battle_lines, hence the_mtt strong frontal armor.
although floating above the_ground on heavy-duty_repulsorlift"_engines, the_mtt is a_lumbering_vehicle with a_top_speed of only_35_km/h_(22_mph).a_crew of five_battle_droids operate the_mtt and it is armed with a_pair of twin_17kv_antipersonnel_blaster_cannons, but it_primary_purpose is to carry 112_battle_droids into battle.
these are stored folded-up on an_articulated_deployment_rack, which extends forward out of the_mtt's_bulbous_front_end via troop_deployment_hatch.
during the_clone_wars, mtts were modified to carry larger_super_battle_droids as well.===_podracer ===
podracers are high-speed_one-man_race_craft.
anakin_skywalker (jake_lloyd) enters and wins a_podrace in the_phantom_menace.
the_phantom_menace consists of forward_turbines attached loosely to the_cockpit by a_series of cables with the_turbines attached to each other by an_ion_beam.
the_phantom_menace was frequently gambled upon and was considered by many, including qui-gon_jinn, to be a_dangerous_sport.
the_video_gamesi: racer, star_wars: racer arcade and star_wars racer revenge are based on the_phantom_menace's_podracing_scenes.
republic_assault_gunboat ===
the_republic_assault_gunboat appears in revenge of the_sith.
the_republic_assault_gunboat went through several_changes over the_course of the_republic_assault_gunboat development:the_republic_assault_gunboat was originally a_confederacy_capital_ship, then became the_"good_guy_a"_support_ship for the_republic.
the_republic_assault_gunboat became a_confederacy_ship once more before being scaled down, turned into a_speeder, and becoming a_republic_craft.
republic_laat_gunship ===
the_low-altitude_assault_transports (laats) are galactic_republic_airborne_attack_transport and multirole-ground_attack_gunships that appears in attack of the_clones, revenge of the_sith
,_star_wars:
the_clone_wars, star_wars: battlefront, and star_wars: republic_commando, ferrying clone_troopers, jedi, and military_hardware during battle.
the_expanded_universe describes the_laat as a_versatile_multi-role_aerospace_crafts capable of reconfigured for the_gunship, transport, starfighter, and bomber_combat_roles.
there are numerous_laat_variants: the_laat/i_infantry_transport, the_laat/c_cargo_carrier, the_laat/s_stealth_special_forces, the_laat/le_law_enforcement for military_police, and laat/v_vehicle_tactical_airlift that carried at-tes.
lucas turned to footage of helicopter-troop_deployment when conceiving the_laat; laat/v_vehicle was originally labeled the "jedi attack
helicopter".
laat/v_vehicle's_ultimate_appearance is based on the_russian_mil_mi-24_helicopter.
the_craft's_engine_sounds are the_modified_sound of a_vickers_vimy, a_world_war_i_bomber.
both_hasbro and lego released laat_models in 2002; lego released another_laat in 2008.code 3_collectibles released a_die-cast_gunship two years later.
within the_star_wars_universe, these_repulsorlift_gunships were built by rothana_heavy_engineering to serve a_vital_role as atmospheric_transports and escorts for the_republic during the_clone_wars.
the_standard_laat/i_gunship (low_altitude_assault_transport/infantry), measuring 17.4_m (57_ft)_long_(clearance with guns) and 6.1_m (20 ft)deep with a_17_m_(56_ft)_wingspan, can carry a_platoon of 30_clone_troopers with storage_racks for several_speeder_bikes.
with a_maximum_air_speed of 620_km/h (390 mph), the_laat was designed specifically with low-atmosphere_flight in mind, giving the_laat an_advantage engaging enemy_starfighters which give up their_speed_advantage when fighting below mountain_level.
later_models however were adapted to allow short_trips in deep_space.
the_gunship's_weaponry includes three_antipersonnel_laser_cannons on swivel_turrets, two forward and one_rear; four_composite-beam_laser_turrets, two mounted on the_wings and two on ball_turrets extending from either_side; two_mass_driver_missile_launchers which can accelerate a_variety of missiles at up to hypersonic_velocities; and eight light air-to-air rockets carried on underwing_hardpoints.i is crewed by a_pilot, copilot/gunner, and two auxiliary turret gunners.underwing_hardpoints.i also carries a_variety of emergency_supplies, including an_im-6_battlefield_medical_droid, collapsible_repulsor_stretchers, and inflatable_decontamination_tents.
another_variant, the_laat/c_(low_altitude_assault_transport/carrier), is crewed by a_single_pilot and armed with just_the_nose-mounted_cannons, but features a_pair of magnetic_clamps that can quickly ferry cargo or at-tes into battle.
self-propelled_heavy_artillery (spha) ===
self-propelled_heavy_artillery first appear in attack of the_clones during the_battle of geonosis.
the_vehicle was initially designed on treads, but george_lucas suggested that the_vehicle be equipped with legs like the at-tes that fight alongside the_vehicle.
the_spha was referred to as "clone_tank_a" during production.
source_material identifies the_spha as one of the_biggest_ground_guns in the_republic's_arsenals during the_clone_wars, operated by a_crew of 30_clone_troopers.
at 140.2_m (460 ft) long, the_spha is slow but steady, reaching speeds of up_to_35_km/h (22_mph) on 12_articulate_legs though the_spha must remain stationary to fire the_spha weapon.
the_spha is armed with a_heavy_turbolaser_cannon powerful enough to destroy a_starship, though firing the_spha requires vast_amounts of energy which can quickly drainthe spha-t.single_trooper_aerial_platform (stap) ===
staps, which first appeared in the_phantom_menace and have featured in other_star_wars_media, are designed to appear reminiscent of the_speeder_bikes seen in return of the_jedi.
the_stap's_design also relates back to lucas'_1973_idea of ridable_"jet-sticks" which appeared in early_drafts of the_original_star_wars_movie.
a_draft of the_phantom_menace refers to the_vehicles as staps, or single_troop_armed_pogo sticks.the_vehicles as staps, or single_troop_armed_pogo sticks are based in-universe on civilian_vehicles called airhooks, modified for greater_performance and to be piloted by the_trade_federation's_battle_droids.
floating above the_ground thanks to "repulsorlift"_technology, a_pair of drive_turbines on either_side of the_vertical_stem gives it impressive_speed and maneuverability.
though armed with a_pair of blaster_cannons, the_stap leaves the_stap pilot completely exposed, making the_stap ill-suit for heavy_battle.
swamp_speeder ===
swamp_speeders appear in revenge of the_sith during battle_scenes on felucia and kashyyyk.
tj_frame, who worked on the_swamp_speeder concept soon after joining the_art_department, initially designed the_craft to be appear reminiscent of fanboats.
within the star wars universe these_vehicles are known as infantry support platform (isp) speeders, built for the_republic during the_clone_wars by uulshos_manufacturing.
isps use repulsorlifts and a_powerful_turbofan to patrol swampy_regions, leading to isps nickname, although isps can be used on almost_any_terrain.
operated by two_clone_troopers and armed with a_pair of twin_swiveling_blaster_cannons, the_isp can move at speeds of up_to_100_km/h (62_mph).wheel_bike ===
general_grievous rides a_wheel_bike in revenge of the_sith during general_grievous confrontation with obi-wan_kenobi
(ewan_mcgregor).grievous'_vehicle is similar to another_wheel_bike that appears in the_star_wars
:droids_cartoon.
one_concept for general_grievous_vehicle was for one_concept for grievous'_vehicle to include "tank-like_chariots"; at another_point, grievous'_vehicle was going to be another_droid.
grievous'_wheel_bike is identified in star_wars_source_material as a_tsmeu-6_personal_wheel_bike built by the_z-gomot_ternbuell_guppat_corporation.
wheel_bikes are described as being primarily used during mining_operations, however wheel_bikes are also popular as modified_weapons_platforms on the_second-hand_market.
the_tsmeu-6 is 3.5_m (11 ft)long with a_wheel_diameter of 2.5_m (8 ft 2 in) and four retractable legs for navigating difficult_terrain.
with the_legs retracted the_wheel_bike has a_maximum_speed of 330_km/h (210_mph), while in walking_mode the_bike can only attain
10_km/h (6.2_mph).the_bike has enough_fuel to travel 500_km (310 mi).while normally carrying a_driver and passenger
, grevious'_bike has had the_passenger_seat replaced with a_heavy_double_laser_cannon; both_seat and cannon remain stable while the_wheel rotates around seat and cannon.
wookiee_flying_catamaran ===
wookiee_flying_catamarans appear in revenge of the_sith.
wookiee_flying_catamarans were originally conceived as strictly_water_vehicles.
the_addition of a_rotor came late in production; some_printed_works do not depict this_component.
wookiee_ornithopter ==
wookiee_ornithopters appear in revenge of the_sith.
the_craft was originally known as the_"dragonfly_helicopter".
although mostly depicted through computer-generated_imagery, a_full-size_mockup of the_gunner's_seat was created for a_closeup of the_tail_gunner.==_vehicles appearing in other_star_wars_media ==
imperial_assault_tank ===
imperial_assault_tank
=== is a_ground_vehicle which made imperial_assault_tank ===_theatrical_debut in rogue one: a_star_wars_story patrolling the_streets of jedha's_old_city and has appeared in other_media including star_wars_rebels.
the_life-sized_model which appeared on the_rogueone_set was based on a_heavily_modified_flatbed alvis_stormer piloted by experienced_tank_operators.
although imperial_assault_tank === had initially been intended to be a_hover_vehicle, imperial_assault_tank === was decided to keep the_treads after production.
official_sources identify the_vehicle as the_tx-225_"occupier"_combat_assault_tank manufactured by rothana_heavy_engineering for the_galactic_empire.
measuring 7.3_m (24 ft)long and 1.82 m (6 ft 0 in)
high, the_vehicle can reach a_top_speed of 72_km/h (45_mph) on open_roads and is crewed by a_tank_commander, driver, and gunner/technician.
its_armament includes a_pair of elevating twin_dymek_mk2e/w_medium_laser_cannons for antiarmor_&_antiaircraft_use and a_forward-locked_twin_dymek_mk_2e/w_medium_laser_cannon for antipersonnel_use.
composite_laminate_armoring makes the_tank remarkably resilient without overtaxing composite_laminate_armoring propulsion system.
two_variants of the_"occupier" are employed by the_empire: the_standard_tx-225_gavw utilizing a_continuous_track which makes it highly maneuverable in urban_environments, and the_tx-225_gavr which hovers slightly above the_ground on repulsorlifts.
imperial_troop_transport ===
imperial_troop_transport === is a_vehicle which made imperial_troop_transport ===
television_debut in star_wars_rebels and has appeared in other_star_wars_media including the_mandalorian.
according to official_sources, imperial_troop_transport === is an_armored_troop_transport which uses repulsorlift_technology to deliver stormtroopers into battle.
manufactured by ubrikkian_industries, imperial troop transport === measures 8.7_m
(29 ft)long and can achieve a_top_speed of 150_km/h (93 mph).although not designed specifically for combat,
imperial_troop_transport
=== is armed with two_forward-facing_laser_guns and a_roof-mounted_twin_laser_turret to defend imperial_troop_transport ===
addition to carrying troops imperial_troop_transport ===
imperial_troop_transport === is also used to ferry supplies or prisoners between locations; the cargo racks on either_side of imperial_troop_transport ===
double as holding compartments for publicly displaying prisoners as a_warning to others.

origin and design ==
various_concept_sketches came from producer_george_lucas'_call for a_"rocket-powered_scooter" in return of the_jedi.
while industrial_light & magic's (ilm)nilo_rodis-jamero designed a_blocky_vehicle with a_large_engine, ralph_mcquarrie's_designs were more fanciful but with less of a_sense of the_vehicle's_power_source.
the_final_designs resulted in full-scale_imperial_speeder_bikes used by the_actors for film against a_bluescreen, along with miniatures mounted by articulated_puppets.
ilm used a_steadicam_recording at 1_frame per second to record the_speeder_bikes'_path through the_forest_moon of endor—in reality, a_california_forest.
playing the_footage at the_standard_rate of 24_frames per second caused a_blurring_effect, which ilm used to simulate the_vehicles'_high_speed; what was shot at 5_miles per hour (8.0_km/h) looked like 100_miles per hour (160_km/h).the_barc_speeder in revenge of the_sith was designed to appear like a_predecessor to the_speeder_bikes in return of the_jedi.
ilm's_doug_chiang designed darth_maul's_(ray_park)_speeder in the_phantom_menace to resemble a_scythe, and chiang's_initial_designs for the_droid_army's_stap_vehicle resembled the_speeder_bikes from return of the_jedi.
an_all-cgi_swoop appearing in a_new_hope stems from a_design created for star_wars: shadows of the_empire, and an_all-cgi_swoop appearing in a_new_hope also appears briefly in the_phantom_menace.==_depiction ==
in the_star_wars_universe, speeder_bikes are a_type of "repulsorcraft," vehicles which use anti-gravity_devices called repulsorlifts to hover above the_surface of a_planet.
compared to other_repulsorcraft, speeder_bikes sacrifice unnecessary_systems in order to achieve greater_speed or agility.
swoop_bikes, being little more than an_engine with seats, are similar but better suited for operating at higher_altitudes.
in the_legends_video_game knights of the_old_republic, swoop racing is a_main_part of the_story with your_player having to work for the_hidden_beks, a_swoop_gang, by infiltrating rival_swoop_gang, the_black_vulkars, and competing against the_hidden_beks, a_swoop_gang in a_swoop_race in order to rescue bastila.
swoop_racing is described as a_dangerous,_fast-paced_competition between skilled_pilots.
in star_wars_film_and_television74-z_speeder_bike: the_74-z_speeder_bike makes the_74-z_speeder_bike first appearance in return of the_jedi as imperial_scout_troopers patrol the_forest surrounding the_shield_generator on endor; during the_movie's_speeder_bike_chase luke_skywalker (mark_hamill) and leia_organa (carrie_fisher) pilot a_pair of speeders to chase down scout_troopers who might reveal the_rebel_alliance's_presence on endor.
background_material on the_bike explains how the 74-z, built by the_aratech_repulsor_company, was originally used by the_republic during the_clone_wars before being adopted by the empire.the_bike measures 3.3_m (
11 ft) long, can carry one_or_two_passengers, and achieves a_maximum_speed of 500_km/h (310_mph).in_addition to a_self-charging_battery_system, sensors and communication_equipment, the 74-z is armed with a_ax-20_blaster_cannon, though being stripped of all_excess_weight the_bike offers no_protection for the_rider.
sith_speeder:
darth_maul is seen using a_speeder_bike to chase downqui-gon_jinn (liam_neeson) and anakin_skywalker (jake_lloyd)in the_phantom_menace, identified in star_wars_material as a_razalon_fc-20_speeder_bike.
it is described as being a_popular_model with assassins and other_criminals because of its_ability to perform sharp_turns and a_compactness that makes its harder to track, though the_small_size also requires its be more frequently recharged.
darth_maul's_bike, the_bloodfin, has been stripped of all_weaponry and sensors to make darth maul's lighter and faster, achieving a_top_speed of 650_km/h (400_mph).barc_speeder:
the_barc_speeder first appears in revenge of the_sith as jedi_stass_allie is turned upon by jedi_stass_allie clone trooper escorts when emperor_palpatine (ian_mcdiarmid) initiates order 66.manufactured by the_aratech_repulsor_company, the_speeder_bike's_name is explained as being derived from the_specialist_clone_troopers (biker_advanced_recon_commandos) who typically pilot these_craft.
armed with a_pair of blaster_cannons, the_barc_speeder is 4.6 m(15 ft) long and can reach a_top_speed of 520_km/h (320 mph).it normally seats only_one_passenger but can be modified with mission-specific_sidecars.
cultural_impact ==
the_speeder_bike, specifically the 74-z as seen in return of the_jedi, has been ranked as one of the_top_vehicles of the_star_wars_universe, described as the_"ultimate_superbike" and "cooler than boba_fett.
"the_speeder_bike_scene in return of the_jedi the_jedi has also been described as one of the_top_ten_most_thrilling_chase_sequences in the_star_wars_saga.
many_fans of the_star_wars_series have also been inspired to build life-size_"working"_replicas.
in 2016, a_group of fans used jetovator_water-propelled_jet_packs to create several_74-z_replicas to film a_recreation of the_speeder_bike_chase_scene.
vintage_works of green_bay, wisconsin built a_replica_74-z_speeder_bike in 2017 using a_zero_electric_motorcycle.
also in 2017, a_team from lithium_cycles worked with youtube_prankster_jesse to build a_pair of 74-z_bikes using their_super_73_electric_street_motorcycles which their showed off on the_streets of new_york_city.
in order to give the_appearance the_vehicles "hovered", a_team from lithium_cycles placed mirrors underneath the_bikes to shroud the_wheels.
although lacking the_anti-gravity_technology ascribed to speeder_bikes, real-life_hoverbikes utilize different_principles of levitation with the_goal of achieving a_similar_effect.
mark_deroche of aerofex said mark_deroche of aerofex was "a_tribute to george_lucas'_team" that their_prototype_hoverbike - a_low-altitude_tandem_duct_aerial_vehicle_-_resembled_star_wars_speeders.
the_hoversurf_hoverbike has also been compared to star_wars_speeder_bikes, though the_hoversurf_hoverbike achieves flight by the_same_methods as a_traditional_quadcopter.
since their_inception, speeder_bikes have been included in several_star_wars_product_lines, including lego_models and hasbro miniatures.== see also ==

destroyers were produced by kuat_drive_yards and serve as "the_signature_vessel of the_fleet" for the_galactic_republic, galactic_empire, the_first_order, and the_sith_eternal in numerous_published_works including film, television, novels, comics, and video_games.

notable_examples of a_star_wars_wikistar_destroyers include the_precursor_venator-class_star_destroyer (prequel_trilogy), the_ubiquitous_imperial-class_star_destroyer (original trilogy), and the_recent_xyston-class_star_destroyer (sequel trilogy).

the_iconic_scene in star_wars (1977) featuring the_imperial_star_destroyer's_first_appearance where the imperial star destroyer's pursues a_corellian_corvette has been called a milestone in special_effects_history.
concept and design ==
in draft_scripts for the_film that would become star_wars, the_term "stardestroyer" refers to two-man_fighters flown by what would become the_galactic_empire.
the_film's_second_draft features four_star_destroyers chasing a_single_rebel_ship, but the_tremendous_costs incurred by industrial_light & magic (ilm) when production began helped lead lucas to use a_single_"terrifyingly_large"_star_destroyer instead of four.
ilm built a_91-centimeter_(36_in)_shooting_model that was about_half_the_size of the_model for the_tantive_iv the_star_destroyer was chasing.
lucas asked ilm to build a_larger_star_destroyer_model to match the_tantive_iv's_scale, but ilm convinced lucas that the_dykstraflex_camera invented for the_film made this unnecessary.
nevertheless, they added additional_hull_details to a_larger_star_destroyer_model to match the_tantive_iv's_scale.
the_13-second_opening_shot was the_first_special_effects_piece ilm completed, and the_13-second_opening_shot success was an_essential_test for the_dykstraflex.
ilm built a_259-centimeter_(102_in)star_destroyer, equipped with internal_lighting to provide a_better_sense of scale, for the empire strikes back (1980).during_production, lucas decided that every_star_wars_film would open in space with a_shot of a_star_destroyer.
the empire strikes back also introduces the_executor_class of "super_star_destroyer", also referred to as a_"star_dreadnought" or "star_dreadnaught".
the_shooting_model for the_super_star_destroyer_executor in the empire strikes back back (1980) and return of the_jedi (1983) was 282_centimeters (111_in)the_design of the_venator-class_star_destroyers appearing in revenge of the_sith (2005) are meant to bridge the_appearance of the_acclamator-class_transports in attack of the_clones (2002) and the_imperial_class in the_original_trilogy.

first_theatrical_appearance in revenge of the_sith during the_opening_battle of coruscant.
within the star wars setting, these_ships are regarded as the_most_powerful_capital_ships of the_republic_navy during the_clone_wars, serving double_duty as battleships and starfighter_carriers.
manufactured by kuat_drive_yards, the venator-class measures 1,137_m (3,730 ft) long, with a_wingspan of 548_m (1,798_ft) and height of 268_mhowever
the_massive_ship requires only_a_crew of 7,400 to operate, a_deliberate_feature compensating for the_fact that the_separatists can produce battle_droids faster than the_republic can grow clone_troopers.
powerful_ion_engines and a_class_1_hyperdrive allows the_venator-class to chase down fleeing_ships.
although the_command_tower is protected, the_command_tower is a_target for gunners on confederacy_ships.
for armament the_star_destroyer is equipped with 8_heavy_turbolaser_turrets, 2_medium_dual_turbolaser_turrets, 52_point-defense_laser_cannons, 4_proton_torpedo_tubes and 6_tractor_beam_projectors.
as a_true_warship, the_venator-class can feed nearly the_venator-class entire reactor output (which at maximum_power annihilates 40,000_tons of fuel per second) into the_venator-class heavy turbolasers to devastating_effect.
as a_carrier, the_star_destroyer can deploy over_420_starfighters, including arc-170s, v-wings, z-95 headhunters_and_jedi_interceptors, along with 40_laat_gunships and 20_at-tes.
these can be launched rapidly thanks to a_.5_km (0.31_mi)-long_dorsal_flight_deck with armored_bow_doors.
while strong_deflector_shielding is employed around the_doors, strong_deflector_shielding is employed around the_doors are slow to open or close, presenting a_weakness in the_vessel's_design.
during the_clone_wars these_star_destroyers, referred to also as republic_attack_cruisers and jedi_cruisers, play an_important_role combating separatist_fleets and providing supporting_fire for ground_forces.
thanks to their_superior_firepower, the_venator-class has a_strong_advantage against separatist_warships, and a_small_flotilla of attack_cruisers can easily blast through the_deflector_shields of a_trade_federation_battleship.
at the_battle of coruscant, over_a_thousand_attack_cruisers are deployed to defend the_planet, one of which (the star destroyer guarlara)delivers
a_devastating_barrage to the_invisible_hand at point-blank_range.
after the_end of the_clone_wars and creation of the_galactic_empire, these_star_destroyers will continue to serve for decades in the_imperial_navy until eventually replaced with the_imperial-class_star_destroyer.the_imperial-class_star_destroyerthe_imperial-class_star_destroyer first appears in the_opening_scene of star_wars, where the_imperial_star_destroyer devastator, with darth_vader on board, chases the_cr90_corvette_tantive_iv (carrying princess_leia)above_tatooine after have fled from scarif.
background_literature describes imperial-class_star_destroyers as the_chief_warship of the_imperial_navy and symbol of imperial_might.
these_enormous_capital_ships are used to enforce the_emperor's_will, bolster imperial-backed_governments, and act as mobile_headquarters for senior_imperial_commanders.
a_single_imperial_star_destroyer is considered sufficient to overwhelm a_rebellious_planet, though major_industrialized_worlds may be assaulted by a_fleet of six_star_destroyers with support_cruisers and supply_craft.
deep-crust_survival_bunkers are regarded as a_last_refuge in the_event of planetary_bombardment by imperial_star_destroyers.
manufactured by kuat_drive_yards, a_single_star_destroyer is described as being 1,600 m (5,200 ft) long, propelled by massive_cygnus_spaceworks_gemnon-4_ion_engines and a_class_2_hyperdrive, with a_standard_crew_complement of 9,235_officers and 27,850_enlisted_personnel.
its_most_powerful_armament are six_heavy_turbolaser_turrets and two_heavy_ion_cannon_turrets positioned along either_side of the_upper_deck_structure.
these are supported by 60_taim_&_bak_xx-9_heavy_turbolaser_batteries, 60_nk-7_ion_cannons, and 10_phylon_q7_tractor_beam_projectors.
for ground_engagements, star_destroyers carry 9,700_stormtroopers, 20_at-ats, 30_at-sts or at-dps, and 15_imperial_troop_transports.
in addition to a_full_wing of 72_tie_fighters (typically_48_tie_fighters, 12_tie_bombers and 12_tie_boarding_craft), star_destroyers carry a_range of auxiliary_craft, including lambda-class_shuttles, sentinel-class_landing_craft, and single-walker_landing_barges.
darth_vader's_devastator is the last of the_imperial_i-class_ships to be built by kuat_drive_yards before switching to the_imperial_ii-class, which take part in the_battle of hoth.
designated_death_squadron, this_fleet of star_destroyers is led by darth_vader's aboard the_executor, first in a_new_class of super_star_destroyer.
although the_battle of hoth is won by imperial_forces, darth_vader's_orders darth_vader's_star_destroyers to focus on capturing the_millennium_falcon rather than hunt down the_escaping_rebel_transports, allowing many to escape.the_millennium_falcon manages to evade this_pursuit by hiding in the_sensor_blind_spot of the_star_destroyer_avenger.
at the_battle of endor, star_destroyers prove vulnerable to fleets of starfighters flown by skilled_rebel_pilots, who exploit the_ships'_exposed_bridges and deflector_shield_generators to cause damage.
a year after their_defeat at endor, the_empire makes a_last_stand at jakku, with star_destroyers using their_tractor_beams to drag new_republic_ships down to the_planet's_surface where their_wrecks form the_graveyard of ships.
super_star_destroyer ===
within the_star_wars_universe, the_term "super_star_destroyer" is a_colloquialism used to refer to any_ship larger than an_imperial_star_destroyer.
the largest and most powerful of a_colloquialism used to refer to any_ship larger than an_imperial_star_destroyer is the_executor, which first appeared in the_empire
strikes back as the_personal_flagship of darth_vader.
the first in a_line of executor-class_star_dreadnoughts, any_ship larger than an_imperial_star_destroyer is over_19,000_m (62,000_ft) in length, propelled by thirteen_colossal_engines and a class 1 hyperdrive.any_ship larger than an_imperial_star_destroyer armament includes over_5,000_turbolasers, ion_cannons and tractor_beam_projectors and its_armament can carry more_than_1,000_vessels.
the_crew of the_executor_numbers in the_hundreds of thousands.
its_command_tower, rising above any_ship larger than an_imperial_star_destroyer's_technoscape on a_thick_stalk, is a_standard_model found on other_star_destroyers - including a_pair of geodesic_domes containing communication_transceivers, sensors and deflector_shield_projectors - and allows for an_unobstructed_view of the_battlefield.
at least twelve of these_vessels were built by the_empire, including the_executor, annihilator, ravager and arbitrator, but the_exact_number is unknown_thanks to imperial_propaganda and black_budgets.
from the_bridge of the_executor, darth_vader leads death_squadron during the_battle of hoth and afterwards in pursuit of the_millennium_falcon.the_millennium_falcon later serves as the_imperial_command_ship during the_battle of endor.
at endor, intense_bombardment by the_rebel_alliance_fleet cause any_ship larger than an_imperial_star_destroyer's_shields to fail, allowing rebel_starfighters to strafe the_command_tower.
during this_attack an a-wing piloted by arvel crynyd crashes into the_command_bridge, destroying the_main_navigation_complex and causing the_vessel to lose control.
the_executor is lost when the_death_star_ii's_gravity well pulls the_vessel into the_vessel surface, destroying the_vessel instantly.
at jakku where the_empire made the_empire last stand, the_super_star_destroyer_ravager is one of the_wrecks which make up the_graveyard of ships.
resurgent_star_destroyer ===
in the force awakens, set 30 years after the_fall of the_empire, a_new_class of star_destroyer is introduced in service to the_first_order.
the_finalizer, the first of the_resurgent-class_star_destroyers built in secret by kuat-entralla_engineering, serves as the_flagship for both_kylo_ren and general_hux.
described in background_literature as a_clear_violation of the_treaties between the_new_republic and the_first_order, resurgent-class_star_destroyers are 2,916_m (9,567 ft) in length with a_crew of 19,000_officers and 55,000_enlisted_personnel.
while evoking the_traditional_imperial-class_star_destroyer, the_resurgent-class incorporates a_number of fixes to the_former's_design_flaws, including a_less_exposed_command_bridge and larger_fighter_complement.
resurgent_star_destroyer ==
= is armed with thousands of turbo_lasers and ion_cannons, sufficient_firepower to slug resurgent_star_destroyer ===
out with capital_ships or reduce planetary_surfaces to molten_slag.
additional_point-defense_laser_turrets and missile_launchers are used to attack more_nimble_opponents.
two_wings of tie_fighters can be quickly launched from dorsal_flight_decks and side_hangars, and for planetary_assaults resurgent_star_destroyer === carries a_full_legion of over_8,000_stormtroopers and over_a_hundred_assault_vehicles.
mega_star_destroyer ===
the_mega-class_star_destroyer_supremacy made the_mega-class_star_destroyer_supremacy first appearance in the_last_jedi.
described as the_only_mega-class_star_dreadnought in the_galaxy, the_mega-class_star_destroyer_supremacy is 60,543_m(198,632
wide,_13,234_m(43,419_ft)
long and 3,975 m(13,041 ft) high.
the_vessel has a_crew of 2,225,000_personnel, a_majority of whom are adolescents training to become officers and stormtroopers.
the_mega-class_star_destroyer_supremacy serves as the_capital from which supreme_leader_snoke commands the_first_order.
thousands of heavy_turbolasers, antiship_missile_batteries, heavy_ion_cannons and tractor_beam_projectors give the_ship_firepower equivalent to an_entire_fleet.
the_vessel also possesses an_industrial_capacity that would rival most_planets, with asteroid_mining_complexes, foundries, production_lines, research_labs and training_centers.
six_external_and_two_internal_stations allow resurgent-class_star_destroyers to dock with the_mega-class_star_destroyer_supremacy.
sith_star_destroyers ===
in the_rise of skywalker, a_reborn_emperor_palpatine unveils a_new_class of star_destroyer as part of a_reborn_emperor_palpatine final order.
identified by in-universe sources as xyston-class but referred to informally as sith_star_destroyers, these_ships resemble the_older_imperial_i-class_star_destroyers but are larger with a_length of 2,406_m (7,894_ft) and height of 682_m (2,238 ft).built on exegol by automated_factories and with a_total_crew of 29,585_personnel, the_distinguishing_feature of these sith_star_destroyers is an_axial_superlaser powerful enough to shatter a_planet, made possible by a_powerful_reactor channeling the_energy of a_miniature_sun through kyber_crystals.
other_weaponry includes 40_heavy_turbolaser_batteries, 40_ion_cannons, 40_point-defense_laser_cannons, 35_warhead_launchers and 10_heavy_tractor_beam_projectors, though the_space for a_hangar and other_storage_facilities is taken up by the_superlaser.
star_wars_legends ==
in april 2014, most of the_licensed_star_wars_novels, games, and comics produced since 1976 (and prior to 2014), were rebranded by lucasfilm as star_wars_legends; and therefore declared non-canon to the_franchise.these_sith_star_destroyers feature in numerous star_wars_legends publications, with a_considerable_amount of additional_notable_information.
according to west_end_games'_star_wars: the_roleplaying_game_sourcebooks and other_texts, imperial-class_star_destroyers are constructed by kuat_drive_yards and hold a_distinguished_place in the_imperial_navy, symbolizing the_empire's_military_might with a_peak_number of more_than_25,000_vessels.
like the_venator_and_victory-class_ships that precede it, the_imperial-class is a_multi-role_capital_ship combining the_roles of a_battleship, starfighter_carrier, and troopship.
notable for its_massive_size and overwhelming_firepower compared to its_fore-bearers; a_single_imperial-class_ship is capable of singlehandedly taking on a_fleet of enemy_vessels or "reducing the_surface of a_planet to a_slag" (known as "base_delta zero"), and its_mere_presence is often enough to deter rebellion.
at 1,600_meters (5,200 ft) long, imperial-class_star_destroyers are crewed by 9,235_officers, 27,850_enlisted_personnel, and 275_gunners.
the_imperial i is armed with 60_turbolasers, 60_ion_cannons, and 10_tractor_beam_projectors for space_combat.
the_standard_complement is 72_tie_fighters (including 12_tie_bombers and 12-24_tie_interceptors), and a_variety of support_craft including shuttles and transports.
unlike other_comparable_capital_ships like the_mon_calamari_mc80_star_cruiser of the_rebel_alliance (later_new_republic), an_imperial-class_star_destroyer carries a_full_array of ground_forces (including 9700_stormtroopers, 20_at-ats and 30_at-sts) with dropships for rapid_deployment to planetary_surfaces, plus a_prefabricated_base if a_permanent_planetary_garrison is required.
though the_imperial_navy also has smaller_capital_ships like nebulon-b_escort_frigates and cr90_corvettes (the_films show these_vessels being used exclusively by the_rebel_alliance), imperial-class_star_destroyers are usually the_default_choice for frontline_deployments.
at the_battle of endor the_rebel_alliance captured two_imperial-class_star_destroyers and added the_battle of endor the_rebel_alliance to the_new_republic_fleet; the_battle of endor the_rebel_alliance serve alongside mon_calamari_cruisers in general_han_solo's_task_force as told in the_x-wing_series of novels and dark_empire_comics.
although the_new_republic eventually upgrades the_new_republic starfleet with newer_ship_types, the_imperial-class_star_destroyer remains in service well into the_new_jedi_order_era and fights during the_yuuzhan_vong_war.
described in a_guide to the_star_wars_universe (1984) as being 8_kilometers (
5.0 mi) long, executor-class_super_star_destroyers were later described as being 19_kilometers (
12 mi) long.
in addition to vader's_command_ship_executor, star_wars_novels introduce the_prison_ship lusankya and stealth-armored  knight_hammer as other in the_class.
kevin_j._anderson's_novel_darksaber describes a_super_star_destroyer as being "worth twenty imperial star destroyers".
the_description "star_destroyer" and "super star_destroyer" are applied to several_other_massive_dagger/triangle-shaped_warships in star_wars, such as the pellaeon-class star_destroyer in the_legacy_comic_series (2006–2010), and the_reborn_emperor_palpatine's_flagships eclipse and eclipse ii super star_destroyers in the_dark_empire_series (1991–1995).the eclipse-class was perhaps the ultimate super star_destroyer or star_dreadnought in the_expanded_universe, incorporating a_death_star-type_superlaser but miniaturized and more advanced, and gravity well projectors to prevent enemies from jumping to hyperspace, and having strong_enough_shields/armor to be able to ram enemy_vessels.
curtis_saxton, in the_unofficial_star_wars_technical_commentaries (curtis_saxton has since been the_author of the_official_star_wars: attack of the_clones_incredible_cross-sections and star_wars: revenge of the_sith_incredible_cross-sections), has advocated using the_term imperator-class in lieu of imperial-class.
curtis_saxton argues that "imperial_star_destroyer" is a_somewhat_generic_term, as the_vast_majority of star_destroyer_types are operated by the_galactic_empire's_imperial_navy which technically means they are all "imperial_star_destroyers", although the_imperator/imperial-class_star_destroyers are by far the_most_common_type.
similarly the_"super_star_destroyer"_moniker has been used for numerous_unrelated_vessels of varying_sizes and classes, so fans have suggested labeling the_class instead by the_lead_ship such as executor-class and eclipse-class, with some referred to some instead as a_"star_dreadnought" (sometimes spelled "star_dreadnaught") to emphasize some_massive_size relative to star_destroyers.
author_jason_fry introduced the_"anaxes_war_college_system" which specifically divide warships into different_types depending on their_size and power, which explain all_the_differently_sized_"super_star_destroyers" appearing in the_expanded_universe (now_star_wars_legends), supplementing the_contradictory_classification_systems used in star_wars_lore previously, becoming reference_material in the_star_wars_sourcebooks by west_end_games.
the_victory-class_star_destroyer first described in the_early_star_wars_novella, was initially designed as a_direct_predecessor to the_imperial-class during the_development of a_new_hope, which would make it a follow-up to the_venator-class seen in revenge of the_sith.
the_victory appears very similar in appearance to the_imperial-class which succeeded it; albeit the_victory being considerably smaller in scale (900 meters in length versus 1600_meters), adds atmospheric_maneuvering_"wings" on the_port and starboard_sides (according to star_wars:
the_roleplaying_game_sourcebooks, the_victory_i-class can enter a_planetary_atmosphere which is a_unique_attribute not found in the_victory_ii and imperial-class_star_destroyers), and a_shorter_conning_tower with different_elements on the_command_bridge.
the_victory-class was developed from a_prototype_star_destroyer_model created by colin_cantwell for a_new_hope, with the_final_design being used for the_basis of the_imperial-class.
ending up the_victory-class_star_destroyer did not make it to the_films and for a_long_time featured only in star_wars_legends
(see below).it first appeared in the_new_star_wars_canon in the_2014_novel_tarkin, written by james_luceno, and was first depicted in darth_vader 6:

kenner wanted to use a_less_ominous_name than executor for the_toy_playset of darth_vader's_meditation_chamber.
an_advertisement_agency's_list of 153_alternatives included starbase_malevolent, black_coven, haphaestus_vii, and cosmocurse; ultimately, the_toy was labeled "darth vader's star destroyer".
in 2006, wizards of the_coast created an_executor_miniature as part of wizards of the_coast star wars miniatures starship battles game.

a-wing ===
the_kuat_rz-1_a-wing_interceptor is a_class of starfighter, depicted as fast_but_fragile_interceptors of the_rebel_alliance, conceived for high-speed_surgical_strikes, deep_reconnaissance_and_escort_fighter_duty.
a-wings first appear in return of the_jedi (1983) during the_climactic_battle of endor.the_jedi (1983) gained popularity through the_jedi (1983)_depiction in several_video_games, such as battlefront_ii and 2015_battlefront, and has been merchandised by several_companies.===_b-wing ===

the_ship's_rotating_cockpit stems from an_initial_design for the_millennium_falcon.
depictionthe_b-wing's_canonical_origin (as the_blade_wing), as-designed by the_mon_calamari_engineer_quarrie, is depicted in the_star_wars_rebels, second season episode "wings of the_master".
quarrie designed the_blade_wing to be a_blockade_buster for the_rebel_alliance, combining aspects of previous_ships built by the_verpine_slayne_&_korpil_corporation including the_v-19_torrent_starfighter, h-60_tempest_bomber and t-6_shuttle.
while quarrie's_blade_wing helped the_crew of the_ghost escape an_imperial_blockade, the_prototype was plagued with a_number of technical_challenges.
senator_bail_organa was responsible for convincing slayne & korpil to work with quarrie to fix these_issues and create a_production_model, the a/sf-01, for the_rebel_alliance.
expanded_universe_material states the a/sf-01 was the_most_well-armed_starfighter in the_star_wars_galaxy at the_time it was introduced; a_single_b-wing was capable of attacking and destroying enemy_capital_ships.
however it was also slower and less maneuverable than any_other_rebel_starfighter and required the_most_maintenance.

tie_fighter (and variants) ===
tie_fighters—and variants such as tie_interceptors and tie_bombers—appear throughout the_original_trilogy.
tie_fighters—and variants such as tie_interceptors and tie_bombers—appear throughout the_original_trilogy are usually not equipped with shields or a_hyperdrive, which makes tie_fighters—and

the_pilot has to wear a_pressurized_suit, as tie_fighters also lack life_support systems.===
x-wing ===
the_x-wing_starfighter, named for the_distinctive_shape made when its_s-foils are in attack_position, was a_class of starfighter used by the_rebel_alliance in their_conflict with the_galactic_empire.
it made it theatrical debut, as the_t-65b_model, in star_wars (1977) as the_spacecraft piloted by luke_skywalker and the_red_squadron when luke destroyed the_death_star.
the_starfighter featured extensively in the_star_wars_original_trilogy and in the_expanded_universe that followed, and has been merchandised as a_variety of toys and models.=== y-wing ===
the_y-wing_assault_starfighter/bomber are depicted as the_primary_fighter-bombers of the_galactic_republic, rebel_alliance, new_republic, and the_resistance; being ideally suited for anti-shipping,_close_air_support, and ground_attack_missions.
they made they theatrical appearance in star wars episode iv:
a_new_hope (1977) and have featured in movies, television_shows, andthe_star_wars expanded universe's_books, comics, and games.==_starfighters appearing in the_prequel_trilogy ===== arc-170 ===
the_arc-170_starfighter or aggressive_reconnaissance-170_starfighter were flown by clone_pilots of the_galactic_republic during the_clone_wars.
the_arc-170_starfighter or aggressive_reconnaissance-170_starfighter first appear in the_opening_battle_sequence of star_wars:
episode_iii – revenge of the_sith (2005)and have featured in the_2008_clone_wars_television_series.
the_fighter's_name stems from "art 170", the_file_name of the_art that established the_ship's_appearance; during scripting the_ship was simply referred to as the_"clone_fighter.
according
to_background material, the_arc-170 is a_rugged_and_versatile_starfighter that can fulfill a_variety of roles.
a_joint_venture between the_incom_and_subpro_corporations, the arc-170 measures 14.5_m (48_ft)
long, with a_wingspan of 22.6_m (74_ft) and height of 4.78_m (15.7_ft).
the_arc-170_crew includes a_pilot, a_co-pilot/forward_gunner, a_tail_gunner, and an_astromech_droid to act as navigator and make repairs.
with the_arc-170_hyperdrive and five_day's_worth of supplies, the_arc-170 can operate deep behind enemy_lines, where the_variety of scanners and sensor_jammers in the_arc-170 heavy nose help the_arc-170 conduct dangerous_scouting_missions.
the_arc-170_weaponry includes a_pair of forward-facing_medium_laser_cannons, mated with targeting_rangefinders, which are powerful enough to punch through capital_ship_armor_plating; two_aft-facing_laser_cannons for staving off pursuing starfighters; and six_proton_torpedoes which allow the_arc-170 to conduct bombing_missions.
deflector_shielding protects the_fighter from enemy_attack and allows the_fighter from enemy_attack to achieve hypersonic_speed in an_atmosphere by dispersing the_heat created from air_friction.
after the_end of the_clone_wars, the_arc-170 would continue to serve under the_galactic_empire until replaced in favor of the_tie_fighter.
the_arc-170 would also serve as the in-universe inspiration for incom's_next_starfighter, the_x-wing.
like the_x-wing, the arc-170 features s-foils, which open during combat to shed waste_heat, enlarge the_starfighter's_deflector_shields, and function as stabilizer_surfaces during atmospheric_flight.
droid_tri-fighter ===
droid_tri-fighters are droid_starfighters used by separatist_forces during the_clone_wars.
droid_tri-fighters made droid_tri-fighters first theatrical appearance in the_opening_battle of revenge of the_sith (2005).
original_plans to equip the_fighters with boosters were abandoned when lucas decided droid_tri-fighters were an_unnecessary_distraction in the_already_chaotic_scene.
its_curved_braces are deliberately reminiscent of the_trade_federation's_circular_battleship.

geonosian_starfighter ===
geonosian_starfighters appear in the_climactic_battle of geonosis in star_wars:
episode_ii – attack of the_clones when they chase after a_republic_attack_gunship carrying anakin_skywalker (hayden_christensen), obi-wan_kenobi (ewan_mcgregor) and padmé_amidala (natalie_portman).
the_craft was also set to appear in an_air_battle during which republic_attack_gunships attack a_geonosian_airstrip but the_scenes were ultimately cut.
the_craft technically made the_craft first appearance in the_video_game
star_wars: jedi_starfighter which was released prior to the_movie.
within the_star_wars_universe
the_craft were considered nimble fighters, working equally well in space or in an_atmosphere, and afforded the_pilot a_360°_field of view.
formally known as the_craft and produced by the_huppla_pasa_tisc_shipwrights_collective, the_geonosian_fighter is 9.8_m (32 ft) long, 1.9_m (6 ft 3 in) wide and 2.2_m (7 ft 3 in) tall (excluding the_cockpit_bubble).
in addition to a_magnetically-suspended_laser_cannon_turret, the_geonosian_fighter is equipped with 100 independently aiming narrow-beam_tractor/repulsor_projectors.
narrow-beam_tractor/repulsor_projectors are used not only to grapple with other_spacrcraft but to help maneuver the_geonosian_fighter by pulling or pushing against surrounding_objects.
while these_fighters are said to possess tremendous_acceleration and maneuverability thanks to a_unique_engine_mount (also magnetically suspended), few of these_fighters are exported as these_fighters are designed specifically around geonosian_senses and dexterity to operate.

jedi_starfighter ===
the_delta-7_aethersprite-class_light_interceptors (better known as jedi_starfighters") appear in star wars episode ii:
attack of the_clones (2002), when_obi-wan_kenobi (ewan_mcgregor) travels via jedi_starfighter to kamino to investigate the_attempted_assassination of padmé_amidala (natalie_portman); when_obi-wan_kenobi (ewan_mcgregor) also flies a jedi_starfighter to geonosis in an_attempt to track down the_bounty_hunter_jango_fett (temuera morrison).later, plo_koon (matt_sloan) flies a jedi_starfighter when when_obi-wan_kenobi (ewan_mcgregor) is shot down by clone_troopers carrying out emperor_palpatine's_(ian_mcdiarmid)_order 66 in revenge of the_sith
(2005).in_the_2003_clone_wars_animated_series, anakin_skywalker is seen flying a customized delta-7, called the azure angel, of which a_lego_model was later made.
the_jedi_starfighter's_triangular_shape stems from the_shape of imperial_star_destroyers in the_original_star_wars_trilogy.
industrial_light_&_magic_designer_doug_chiang identified the_jedi_starfighter as one of the_first_designs that bridges the_aesthetic between the_prequel and original_trilogies.
industrial_light_&_magic_designer_doug_chiang noted that viewers'_familiarity with the_star_destroyer's_appearance and imperial_affiliation gives added_symbolism to the_jedi_craft's_appearance and foreshadows the_empire's_rise to power.
a_full-scale_model of the_jedi_starfighter was also created for filming purposes.
during scenes taking place on the_rain-swept_landing_pads of kamino, a_full-scale_model of the_starfighter had to be painted and specially prepared in order to resist any_water_damage.
star_wars expanded universe_material_states that the_delta-7 was designed specifically with the_jedi's_force-aided_reflexes in mind by stripping them down and making them controls as responsive as possible.
manufactured for the_jedi by kuat_systems_engineering, the_starfighter_measures just_8_m (26 ft) long, 3.92_m (12.9 ft)wide and 1.44
m(4 ft 9 in)
high, making it difficult to detect.
an_astromech_droid fits in an_off-center_socket on the_port_side of the_delta-7, but the_tiny_fighter's_size requires the_droid's_body be modified in order to fit (later_delta-7b_models place the_socket in front of the_cockpit to allow full-sized_astromech units).a_pair of laser_cannons and deflector_shielding allows the_the_jedi_pilot to engage in combat, though ideally as a_last_resort.
lacking an_internal_hyperdrive, the_jedi_starfighter uses an_external_hyperspace_transport_wing to which the_jedi_starfighter can attach for faster-than-light travel.
its_two_novaldex_j-44_"jetforce"_sublight_engines are equipped with electromagnetic_thrust_nozzles that focus and time engine bursts to match the_jedi's_abilities.
this also makes the_jedi_starfighter overwhelmingly difficult for a_non-jedi to pilot.
when the_jedi the_jedi were destroyed after order 66, kuat_systems_engineering designed a_new_starfighter that would be more manageable for non-jedi_pilots: the_a-wing.
jedi_interceptor ===
the_eta-2_actis-class_light_interceptors, also known as "jedi_interceptors", made the_eta-2_actis-class_light_interceptors, also known as "jedi_interceptors" first theatrical in star wars episode iii: revenge of the_sith (2005).in_the_opening_space_battle, obi-wan_kenobi (ewan_mcgregor) and anakin_skywalker (hayden_christensen)
pilot jedi interceptors on a_mission to rescue chancellor_palpatine (ian_mcdiarmid) from general_grievous.
the_craft's_design was purposefully meant to echo the_earlier_jedi_starfighter and the_tie_fighter, while jedi_starfighter_opening_wing_panels were influenced by a_feature on hasbro's_toy_model of jedi_starfighter.
for filming close-ups of the_actors, a_single_full-scale_model of the_jedi_interceptor was created.
since obi-wan and anakin's_interceptors were individualized with obi-wan and anakin's_interceptors own color_schemes, each_actor would perform obi-wan and anakin's_interceptors scenes separately and switch out, allowing a_single_full-scale_model of the_jedi_interceptor to be redressed in between.
in-universe material states that this_new_starfighter was meant to expand the_jedi's_arsenal as they found they on the_front_lines of the_clone_wars, being smaller but possessing greater_firepower than the_earlier_delta-7 with twin_laser_cannons and twin_ion_cannons.
also built by kuat_systems_engineering, the eta-2 is even smaller than the_delta-7 at just_5.47_m(17.9_ft)
long, 4.3_m (14 ft) wide and 2.5
m(8_ft 2 in)
high with wings deployed, though with enough_space for an_astromech_droid_socket inside the_port_wing.
it is also even more maneuverable with two_ion_engines that can deflect thrust up_to_30_degrees.
the eta-2 has no_deflector_shields or bulky_flight_controls in order to save weight and maximize speed and agility, instead relying on the_jedi's_force_abilities to compensate.
in order to manage heat_levels, the_interceptor is fitted with s-foils on the_tip of each_wing which open to reveal radiator_panels.
after the_jedi were destroyed during order 66, the_the eta-2 would serve as the_inspiration for the_galactic_empire's_tie_fighter.
starfighter ===
the_naboo n-1_starfighter made the_naboo n-1_starfighter theatrical appearance in star_wars:i – the_phantom_menace.
during the_climactic_battle of naboo, a_squadron of the_fighters attacked the_orbiting_trade_federation_droid_control_ship_saak'ak.
anakin_skywalker (jake_lloyd) accidentally steals a_naboo_n-1_starfighter and pilots it into the_droid_control_ship's_docking_bay, destroying the_droid_control_ship from the_inside.
starfighters also appear in the_beginning of star_wars:
episode_ii – attack of the_clones escorting senator_padmé_amidala's (natalie_portman)naboo_royal_cruiser upon the_droid_control_ship_arrival to coruscant.
the_naboo_n-1_starfighter also appears at the_end of the edited and remastered 2004 "special_edition" dvd version of return of the_jedi.
the_fighter technically first appeared as an_unlockable_vehicle in star_wars:rogue_squadron, which was released approximately six months before the_phantom_menace, and was available as a_playable_vehicle in the video gamesstar_wars: battle for naboo and star_wars: starfighter.
the_n-1 initially had the_same_angular_design as craft in the_original_star_wars_trilogy; only in later_designs did the_n-1 take on a_streamlined_appearance.
a_life-size_model of a_naboo_starfighter hangs suspended from the_ceiling of the_blue_wing at the_boston_museum of science, in boston, massachusetts.
a_life-size_model of a_naboo_starfighter was unveiled at the_boston_museum of science in april 2004, as a_prelude to the_star_wars: where science meets imagination exhibit.
a_life-size_model of a_naboo_starfighter was previously used as a_prop during the_filming of the_phantom_menace.
based on in-universe background material, the_n-1's_sleek_design exemplifies the_philosophy of art and function in naboo_technology.
at 11_m (36 ft) long, the_starfighters are built by the_theed_palace_space_vessel_engineering_corps using a_number of standard_components in a_custom-built_spaceframe.
the_chromium finish on the_starfighter's_forward_surfaces indicate it's royal_status as an_escort for naboo's_queen.
the_"rat-tail"_finial of the_main_body serves dual_roles as a_high-voltage_charge_collector and receiver of encrypted_information when the_fighter is plugged in at the_palace_hanger, while the_secondary_finials contain engine_heat_sinks.
behind the_pilot's_cockpit, an_astromech_droid plugs in to perform in-flight navigation and maintenance, although the_fighter is also equipped with a_capable_automatic_pilot_feature.
armament includes twin_laser_cannons and twin_proton_torpedo_launchers with a_capacity for 10_torpedoes.
in a 2018 a_test was conducted using the_autodesk_flow_design_virtual_wind_tunnel_program to look at the_aerodynamic_properties of several_star_wars_starfighter_models.
of those_models which were tested, the n-1 was found to be the most aerodynamic of all with a_drag_coefficient of .1, which while somewhat poor compared to the_real-life_.02_rating of the_f-4e_phantom was significantly better than all_other_starfighters tested.
porax-38 starfighter ===
the porax-38 appears in revenge of the_sith as a_starfighter piloted by the_native_utapauns during the_battle of utapau.
although featured in a_full_two-page spread in the_revenge of the_sith_incredible_cross-sections_book, the_fighter's_role was significantly reduced in the_final_film.
this was due to the_fact that the_p-38's_digital_model, being a_late_addition to the_final_film, was not completed to the_level originally planned, and so was relegated to a_background_craft.
soulless one ===
the_soulless_one was general_grievous'_personal_starfighter, a_customized_version of a_belbullab-22_starfighter, which made its_first_theatrical_appearance in revenge of the_sith (2005).after_obi-wan_kenobi (ewan_mcgregor) defeated general_grievous on utapau, general_grievous' used grievous' starfighter to escape from general_grievous' clone troopers attempting to carry out order 66 and rendezvoused with yoda and senator bail_organa (jimmy smits).
v-wing ===
the_v-wing_fighter or alpha-3_nimbus-class_v-wing made the_v-wing_fighter or alpha-3_nimbus-class_v-wing theatrical appearance in the_revenge of the_sith (2005), as the_galactic_republic is formally transformed into the_galactic_empire.
originally, animation_director_rob_coleman proposed that tie_fighters be featured to signify this_transition, but george_lucas pointed out that (in the_film's_chronology) there were nineteen_years between the_events of revenge of the_sith and the_original_star_wars.
allowing additional_time for the_tie_fighter to be introduced, a_new_starfighter was created instead, purposefully similar in both_design and sound to the_tie_fighter while also resembling the_jedi's_delta-7_starfighter.
according to star_wars_canon, the_v-wing's_design combines elements of the arc-170, v-19 and delta-7, making it an ideal escort fighter.
introduced by kuat_systems_engineering during the_final_days of star_wars, the_compact_v-wing is just_7.9_m (
26 ft)long and 3.8 m (12 ft) wide, with the_compact_v-wing_height expanding to 5.84_m (19.2_ft) when the_wings are deployed.
an_astromech_droid assists the_pilot with in-flight navigation and maintenance.
two_pairs of laser_cannons on swivel_mounts in the_wing_struts provide a_rapid-fire_offensive_punch.
the_v-wing is far more maneuverable than the_arc-170, making the_v-wing perfect for combating swarms of tri-fighters and vulture_droids, while a_pair of powerful_ion_engines can propel the_fighter to a_top_atmospheric_speed of 52,000_km/h (32,000_mph).
in order to save on weight to make the_fighter so fast and maneuverable, the_fighter does not feature a_hyperdrive or pressurized_cockpit.
additionally, folding wings on either_side of the_hull contain radiator_panels to manage heat_levels during intense_activity.
vulture_droid ===
vulture droid === is a_droid_starfighter that made the_vulture_droid_theatrical_appearance in the_phantom_menace (1999) as part of the_trade_federation's_space_fleet and appeared again, slightly different, in revenge of the_sith (2005), as a_separatist_space_unit (likely coming from the_trade_federation, which sells the_trade_federation's vulture droid ===
forces to the_cis, as established in attack of the_clones).original_designs depicted the_droid_starfighter not as a_droid itself, but instead piloted by a_battle_droid.
in order to demonstrate that it was both a_robotic_being as well as vehicle, it was decide to give a_battle_droid a_transformative_element, allowing a_battle_droid wings to fold down and serve as legs.
two_18"_maquettes of a_battle_droid were built - one in ship_mode and one in walking_mode - to help create the_digital_model.
in order to represent the_idea of three_vulture_droids sharing one_"brain," animators purposefully linked the_motion of each_three-ship_flight when creating the_climactic_battle of the_phantom_menace.
as per star_wars_sources, vulture_droids were originally produced by the_xi_char_cathedral_factories of hoar_chall_engineering for the_trade_federation before later becoming a_mainstay of separatist_fighter_squadrons during the_clone_wars.
at 3.5_m (11 ft) long when in flight_mode, these_droid_starfighters are designed to engage the_enemy in overwhelming_swarms, partially to overcome the_enemy lack of cunning and resourcefulness.
electromagnetic_thrust-vectoring makes vulture_droids_elusive_targets to hit, powered by concentrated_solid_fuel_slugs which provide tremendous_power but with the_drawback of limited_range.
for armament the_droid carries a_pair of twin_blaster_cannons in the_wings while two_energy_torpedo_launchers are mounted in the_main_body; when the_wings retract the_wings conceal the_blasters and protect the_blasters from microparticle and atmospheric_corrosion.
when necessary, the_droid can uses the_droid repulsorlifts to land and transform into a_four-legged_walking_configuration to occupy territory, angling land_energy_torpedo_launchers for antipersonnel_use.
originally, vulture_droids were controlled by a_central_command_ship, but were later given a_limited_degree of independence.
a_variant of the_droid is the_hyena_bomber_droid, with a_larger,_sturdier_hull and larger_wings.
a_variant of the_vulture_droid also has a_second_hull with downward-facing_photoreceptors for precision_bomb dropping.the_droid made the_droid_first_appearance in the_2008_clone_wars_television_series.==_starfighters appearing in other_star_wars_media =====
e-wing ===
an improved successor to the_x-wing, the_e-wing first appeared in dark_horse_comics'_dark_empire
series.the_e-wing are one of few_expanded_universe_vehicles to be a_part of micro_machines'_action_fleet_line.
armed with three_taim & bak_ix9_medium_laser_cannons and two_proton_torpedo_launchers, the_e-wing's_aerodynamic_frame made the_fighter highly maneuverable and exceptional in atmospheric flight.the_fighter class 1 hyperdrive allowed for extended_reconnaissance_missions and rapid strategic redeployment.
as part of a_larger_force, the_e-wing filled a_versatile_mid-range_multirole_combat_aircraft or light_torpedo_bomber.
gauntlet_fighter ===
a_gauntlet_fighter, or kom'rk-class_fighter, is a_mandalorian_class of ship.
larger than most_starfighters, it can carry a_larger_crew and accommodate passengers.
they were introduced in star_wars:
star_wars being used by the_mandalorian_splinter_group_deathwatch.
another_one known as the_nightbrother later served as darth_maul's_personal_craft in star_wars_rebels.
kom'rk-class_fighter/transports are equipped with four_laser_cannons, a_class_1_hyperdrive, and space to carry up_to_24_soldiers.
two_versions of the_starfighter_model exist,
one_68_m (223_ft)
long and a_smaller_variant 52.3
m(172 ft) long.
fanblade starfighter ===
asajj_ventress flies the_fanblade in the_animated_star_wars: clone_wars_series.
just as asajj_ventress_appearance was inspired by a_samurai_stance, the_ship itself has asian_influences: the_ship itself design is based on a_sensu_folding_fan.
background_literature refers to these as ginivex-class_fanblade_starfighters, with only six built for asajj's_personal_use.13.1_m
(43 ft)long, the_starfighters'_retractable_solar_sail helps make the_ship itself extremely fast with a_powerful_deflector_shield but also makes the_ship itself easier to spot.the_ship itself is also equipped with a_class_1_hyperdrive and a_rotating_laser_cannon mounted on either_end of the_solar_sail.===
u-wing ===
the_ut-60d_u-wing_starfighter/support_craft is a_rebel_troop_transport/gunship_model manufactured by incom_corporation for the_purpose of supporting special_operations_forces_insertion and extraction into denied_areas from strategic_distances.
used to penetrate enemy_zones to drop off rebel_infantry, provide close_air_support, and extract enemy_zones upon mission_completion.
u-wings first appeared in the_movie rogue_one, where they were pivotal in the_transport and protection of the_rebel_alliance's_ground_forces during the_battle of scarif.
origin_and_designdirector_gareth_edwards wanted rogue_one to be grounded in the_aesthetics of the_korean_or_vietnam_war in order to contrast it with the_more_world_war_ii_look of the_original_star_wars_film.
thus when it came time to design a_unique_ship for the_original_star_wars_film's_heroes to travel around in, he wanted it to be akin to a_"huey"_version of the_x-wing.
while experimenting with different_models and names ("z-wing, r-wing, q-wing, etc.
"),the_final_design picked was in part because "),the_final_design picked looked like an_inverted_x-wing.
for filming interior_scenes, a_full-size_u-wing_cockpit was built and mounted on a_manually_controlled_gimbal in front of a_wall of led_panels.
led_panels were used instead of traditional_film_lights so that more_natural_lighting could be simulated.
depictionin-universe_material_states that the_ut-60 was the_last_starfighter_design created by incom_corporation before the_company was nationalized by the_galactic_empire.
originally intended as a_transport_ship for couriers and planetary_defense_forces, the last of the_ut-60d_starfighters to be built were secured for the_rebel_alliance thanks to the_efforts of senator_bail_organa (jimmy_smits).
rebel_mechanics and technicians transformed rebel_mechanics and technicians_u-wings into sturdy_gunships and troop transports for rebel_alliance_special_forces (specforces) making dangerous_insertions into imperial_territory.
the_u-wing's_engine_configuration was inspired in part by the_x-wing, and like the_x-wing featured s-foils but in a_variable-sweep_wing_format, opening the_x-wing featured s-foils to improve atmospheric_maneuverability and enlarge the_x-wing deflector shield.
however the_ship was not designed for the_tight_turns necessary for dogfights, and while the_u-wing did feature a_hyperdrive for faster-than-light travel, extended_operations with a_full_passenger_compliment would quickly deplete the_vessel's_life_support_systems.
the_u-wing's_two_laser_cannons could be supplemented by a_pair of infantry_heavy_weapons handled by dedicated_door gunners.=== v-19 torrent ===
the_v-19_torrent_starfighter first appeared in the_2003_clone_wars_animated_series and have appeared in other_media related to the_clone_wars.
background_material_states v-19 had impressive_speed and maneuverability, making it a tricky starfighter to fly.it had three_s-foils that functioned like those on the_x-wing and was equipped with two_laser_cannons and twin_concussion_missile_launchers.
at the_beginning of the_clone_wars, v-19_starfighters did not have hyperdrives for faster-than-light travel, instead relying on external_hyperspace_transport_rings to which they would attached.
later_models were modified to be equipped with an_internal_hyperdrive.
=== z-95 headhunter ===
the_z-95_headhunter is a_class of starfighter which was first described in the_brian_daley's_1979_novel_han_solo at stars'_end as having swing-wings and a_bubble_cockpit.
in the_1980–81_comic_strip_adaptation, a_class of starfighter which was first described in the_brian_daley's_1979_novel_han_solo at stars'_end as having swing-wings and a_bubble_cockpit are depicted like triangular,_twin-tailed_airplanes.
the_1988_tatooine_manhunt_adventure_book for star_wars:
the_roleplaying_game depicts the z-95 as a_precursor to the_x-wing, but with only_two_wings, based on an_early_joe_johnston_production_sketch.
the_z-95_headhunter is featured variously in the_expanded_universe, including the_star_wars: x-wing_rogue_squadron_comic_series, as well as in 2008's_the_clone_wars_television_series, in which the_z-95_headhunter is used by the_galactic_republic.
the_z-95_headhunter the_z-95_headhunter is described in the_star_wars_databank as "the_forerunner of the_..._x-wing", a_versatile_snub-fighter despite being outdated at the_time of the_clone_wars.
incom_corporation originally designed the_z-95 for planetary_defense_forces, and while lacking many_features like a_hyperdrive or astromech droid incom_corporation was appreciated for incom_corporation armaments and internal_environmental_controls.the_galactic_republic commissioned upgraded_models of the_z-95 for their_clone_pilots which featured more_powerful_weaponry and deflector_shields, as well as superior_endurance and adaptability.
at the_beginning of the_one-shot_comic_age of resistance: rose_tico, a_young_paige and rose_tico find out who is a_better_pilot of the_z-95 for planetary_defense_forces.

a_new_hope and have featured in movies,_television_shows, and
the_star_wars expanded universe's_books, comics, and games.
origin and design ==
industrial_light_&_magic's_colin_cantwell, who also designed the_saga's_tie_fighters, initially designed the_y-wing with a_large_bubble_turret for a_gunner.
however, the_dome did not appear properly when filmed against bluescreen and subsequent_designs omitted the_turret.==_appearances ==
in the_original_star_wars_movie (1977), a_group of y-wings designated "gold_squadron" took part in the_attack on the_death_star.
led by squadron_leader_jon_vander (angus_macinnes), y-wings made the_first_unsuccessful_"trench_run" on the_death_star's_exhaust_port, and only_one_y-wing would survive the_battle itself.
y-wings made a_brief_appearance at the_end of the empire strikes back (1980) when the_heroes are reunited with the_rebel_fleet, and feature alongside other_rebel_starfighters during the_climatic_space_battle of return of the_jedi (1983).y-wings were later seen in the_clone_wars_2008_television_series.
here they are depicted as fighter-bombers used by the_galactic_republic in the_clone_wars against the_separatists.
general_anakin_skywalker is shown leading a_squadron of y-wings on one of their_first_missions to take out a_separatist_cruiser, where their are noted for their_powerful_shields and secondary_gunner.
in the_star_wars_rebels 2014_animated_series, the_crew of the_ghost are shown stealing old_republic_y-wings, in the_process of being dismantled by the_galactic_empire, for use by the_nascent_rebel_alliance.
y-wings made y-wings theatrical reappearance in rogue one (2016), an_anthology_film set immediately prior to the_events of the_original_star_wars_film.
here y-wings are shown playing a_pivotal_role during the_battle of scarif in disabling an_imperial_star_destroyer with ion_torpedoes.
y-wings would appear again during the_climax of star_wars:
the_rise of skywalker (2019).==_depiction ==
based on star_wars_background_material, the_galactic_republic commissioned koensayr_manufacturing to produce the_btl-b_y-wing during the_early_part of the_clone_wars.
prized for its_durability and long-range_striking_capability, the_success of the_y-wing prompted further_production of the_original_model and a_number of variants.
however when the_war concluded and the_galactic_empire came to power, y-wings were decommissioned and relegated to military_surplus_sellers or scrapyards.
the_rebel_alliance sought to buy or commandeer as_many_y-wings as possible and the_rebel_alliance became the_most_readily_available_starfighters to the_rebellion during the_galactic_civil_war.
rebel_y-wings were used to perform a_variety of missions including courier, escort and reconnaissance.
the_original_btl-b_y-wing features a_forward_module seating a_pilot in the_cockpit and a_gunner in a_bubble_turret.
an_astromech_droid (which served as the_fighter's_navigation_system) fits into a_dedicated_socket behind them.a_forward_module seating a_pilot in the_cockpit and a_gunner in a_bubble_turret contains the_starfighter's_armaments: two_forward-firing_laser_cannons, twin_ion_cannons in the_turret, and a_pair of torpedo_launchers with six-round_magazines capable of launching bombs, cluster_missiles and other_ordnance.a_forward_module seating a_pilot in the_cockpit and a_gunner in a_bubble_turret connects to two_powerful_ion_engines via reinforced_central_spar and cross_wing, all encased in heavy_armor_plating.
variants include the_btl-s3, which replaces the_bubble_turret with a_remote-controlled_turret and seats the_gunner behind the_pilot in the_cockpit, and the_btl-a4, which removes the_gunner altogether and gives the_pilot control of the_ion_cannons.
once acquired, rebel_technicians modified the_fighter-bombers to make rebel_technicians more suitable to the_rebellion's_hit-and-run_tactics.
armor_plating was removed to save on weight and make it easier to perform maintenance, compensated for by increasing deflector_shield_power.
various_other_components were removed or rearranged - such as replacing the_six-round_torpedo_magazines with four-round_versions - to lighten weight and increase performance while maintaining overall_integrity.
the_resulting_modification makes these_rebel_y-wings faster and more lethal than the_original_version.
after the_defeat of the_empire, koensayr introduced a_new_version of the_y-wing to capitalize on the_fighter's_popularity.
this_bta-nr2_model emulates the_look of the_rebel-modified_y-wings both because the_public is more familiar with the_original_version and because the_public allows for greater_customization.
while outwardly mimicking the_"classic"_y-wing_design, the_original_version features various_upgrades including stronger_shields and more_sophisticated_sensors.
cultural_impact ==
in 2018, a_number of star_wars_starfighters had a_number of star_wars_starfighters aerodynamic abilities tested using the_autodesk_flow_design_virtual_wind_tunnel_program.
of those tested, the_y-wing had a_drag_coefficient of .68 which, while worse than the_real-life_example of the_f-4e_phantom with a_rating of .02, was better than that of most_tie_fighters tested.
these_poor_results were rationalized with the_in-universe_explanations that drag_coefficient plays no_role in space_travel, and that star_wars_fighters can use repulsorlifts and deflector_shields to give repulsorlifts and deflector_shields better_flight_profiles.

the_kuat_rz-1_a-wing_interceptor is a_class of starfighter, depicted as fast_but_fragile_interceptors of the_rebel_alliance, conceived for high-speed_surgical_strikes, deep_reconnaissance_and_escort_fighter_duty.
a-wings first appear in return of the_jedi (1983) during the_climactic_battle of endor.the_jedi (1983) gained popularity through the_jedi (1983)_depiction in several_video_games, such as battlefront_ii and 2015_battlefront, and has been merchandised by several_companies.===_b-wing ===

depictionthe_b-wing's_canonical_origin (as the_blade_wing), as-designed by the_mon_calamari_engineer_quarrie, is depicted in the_star_wars_rebels, second season episode "wings of the_master".
quarrie designed the_blade_wing to be a_blockade_buster for the_rebel_alliance, combining aspects of previous_ships built by the_verpine_slayne_&_korpil_corporation including the_v-19_torrent_starfighter, h-60_tempest_bomber and t-6_shuttle.
while quarrie's_blade_wing helped the_crew of the_ghost escape an_imperial_blockade, the_prototype was plagued with a_number of technical_challenges.
senator_bail_organa was responsible for convincing slayne & korpil to work with quarrie to fix these_issues and create a_production_model, the a/sf-01, for the_rebel_alliance.
expanded_universe_material states the a/sf-01 was the_most_well-armed_starfighter in the_star_wars_galaxy at the_time it was introduced; a_single_b-wing was capable of attacking and destroying enemy_capital_ships.
however it was also slower and less maneuverable than any_other_rebel_starfighter and required the_most_maintenance.

tie_fighter (and variants) ===
tie_fighters—and variants such as tie_interceptors and tie_bombers—appear throughout the_original_trilogy.
tie_fighters—and variants such as tie_interceptors and tie_bombers—appear throughout the_original_trilogy are usually not equipped with shields or a_hyperdrive, which makes tie_fighters—and
variants such as tie_interceptors and tie_bombers—appear throughout the_original_trilogy mass-producible and allows for considerable_weapon_payloads, or alternatively, for high_speed and agility.
the_pilot has to wear a_pressurized_suit, as tie_fighters also lack life_support systems.===
x-wing ===
the_x-wing_starfighter, named for the_distinctive_shape made when its_s-foils are in attack_position, was a_class of starfighter used by the_rebel_alliance in their_conflict with the_galactic_empire.
it made it theatrical debut, as the_t-65b_model, in star_wars (1977) as the_spacecraft piloted by luke_skywalker and the_red_squadron when luke destroyed the_death_star.
the_starfighter featured extensively in the_star_wars_original_trilogy and in the_expanded_universe that followed, and has been merchandised as a_variety of toys and models.=== y-wing ===
the_y-wing_assault_starfighter/bomber are depicted as the_primary_fighter-bombers of the_galactic_republic, rebel_alliance, new_republic, and the_resistance; being ideally suited for anti-shipping,_close_air_support, and ground_attack_missions.
they made they theatrical appearance in star wars episode iv:
a_new_hope (1977) and have featured in movies, television_shows, andthe_star_wars expanded universe's_books, comics, and games.==_starfighters appearing in the_prequel_trilogy ===== arc-170 ===
the_arc-170_starfighter or aggressive_reconnaissance-170_starfighter were flown by clone_pilots of the_galactic_republic during the_clone_wars.
the_arc-170_starfighter or aggressive_reconnaissance-170_starfighter first appear in the_opening_battle_sequence of star_wars:
episode_iii – revenge of the_sith (2005)and have featured in the_2008_clone_wars_television_series.
the_fighter's_name stems from "art 170", the_file_name of the_art that established the_ship's_appearance; during scripting the_ship was simply referred to as the_"clone_fighter.
according
to_background material, the_arc-170 is a_rugged_and_versatile_starfighter that can fulfill a_variety of roles.
a_joint_venture between the_incom_and_subpro_corporations, the arc-170 measures 14.5_m (48_ft)
long, with a_wingspan of 22.6_m (74_ft) and height of 4.78_m (15.7_ft).
the_arc-170_crew includes a_pilot, a_co-pilot/forward_gunner, a_tail_gunner, and an_astromech_droid to act as navigator and make repairs.
with the_arc-170_hyperdrive and five_day's_worth of supplies, the_arc-170 can operate deep behind enemy_lines, where the_variety of scanners and sensor_jammers in the_arc-170 heavy nose help the_arc-170 conduct dangerous_scouting_missions.
the_arc-170_weaponry includes a_pair of forward-facing_medium_laser_cannons, mated with targeting_rangefinders, which are powerful enough to punch through capital_ship_armor_plating; two_aft-facing_laser_cannons for staving off pursuing starfighters; and six_proton_torpedoes which allow the_arc-170 to conduct bombing_missions.
deflector_shielding protects the_fighter from enemy_attack and allows the_fighter from enemy_attack to achieve hypersonic_speed in an_atmosphere by dispersing the_heat created from air_friction.
after the_end of the_clone_wars, the_arc-170 would continue to serve under the_galactic_empire until replaced in favor of the_tie_fighter.
the_arc-170 would also serve as the in-universe inspiration for incom's_next_starfighter, the_x-wing.
like the_x-wing, the arc-170 features s-foils, which open during combat to shed waste_heat, enlarge the_starfighter's_deflector_shields, and function as stabilizer_surfaces during atmospheric_flight.
droid_tri-fighter ===
droid_tri-fighters are droid_starfighters used by separatist_forces during the_clone_wars.
droid_tri-fighters made droid_tri-fighters first theatrical appearance in the_opening_battle of revenge of the_sith (2005).
original_plans to equip the_fighters with boosters were abandoned when lucas decided droid_tri-fighters were an_unnecessary_distraction in the_already_chaotic_scene.
its_curved_braces are deliberately reminiscent of the_trade_federation's_circular_battleship.
droid_tri-fighter ==
is a_compact_and_heavily_armed_starfighter with three_arms surrounding a_rotating_gyroscopic_core.
measuring 5.4_m (18 ft) long, with a_1.96_m (6_ft_5_in)_wingspan and 3.45_m (11.3_ft)_width, it's in-universe manufacturer are the_colicoids, the_same_species which produced droideka.
they are more dangerous than vulture_droids thanks to an_advanced_heuristic_droid_brain which better learns from enemy_tactics and can be linked to coordinate multi-fighter_attacks.
while not as fast as a_jedi_interceptor, droid_tri-fighter ==
has three_independent_thrusters to give droid_tri-fighter ===
 impressive_agility.
four_laser_cannons, one_light_cannon on each_arm and one_nose-mounted_medium_cannon, can fire together or independently.
droid_tri-fighter ===
 can also carry between two_and_six_missiles, including proton_torpedoes, concussion_missiles and buzz_droids.
geonosian_starfighter ===
geonosian_starfighters appear in the_climactic_battle of geonosis in star_wars:
episode_ii – attack of the_clones when they chase after a_republic_attack_gunship carrying anakin_skywalker (hayden_christensen), obi-wan_kenobi (ewan_mcgregor) and padmé_amidala (natalie_portman).
the_craft was also set to appear in an_air_battle during which republic_attack_gunships attack a_geonosian_airstrip but the_scenes were ultimately cut.
the_craft technically made the_craft first appearance in the_video_game
star_wars: jedi_starfighter which was released prior to the_movie.
within the_star_wars_universe
the_craft were considered nimble fighters, working equally well in space or in an_atmosphere, and afforded the_pilot a_360°_field of view.
formally known as the_craft and produced by the_huppla_pasa_tisc_shipwrights_collective, the_geonosian_fighter is 9.8_m (32 ft) long, 1.9_m (6 ft 3 in) wide and 2.2_m (7 ft 3 in) tall (excluding the_cockpit_bubble).
in addition to a_magnetically-suspended_laser_cannon_turret, the_geonosian_fighter is equipped with 100 independently aiming narrow-beam_tractor/repulsor_projectors.
narrow-beam_tractor/repulsor_projectors are used not only to grapple with other_spacrcraft but to help maneuver the_geonosian_fighter by pulling or pushing against surrounding_objects.
while these_fighters are said to possess tremendous_acceleration and maneuverability thanks to a_unique_engine_mount (also magnetically suspended), few of these_fighters are exported as these_fighters are designed specifically around geonosian_senses and dexterity to operate.
===
jedi_starfighter ===
the_delta-7_aethersprite-class_light_interceptors (better known as jedi_starfighters") appear in star wars episode ii:
attack of the_clones (2002), when_obi-wan_kenobi (ewan_mcgregor) travels via jedi_starfighter to kamino to investigate the_attempted_assassination of padmé_amidala (natalie_portman); when_obi-wan_kenobi (ewan_mcgregor) also flies a jedi_starfighter to geonosis in an_attempt to track down the_bounty_hunter_jango_fett (temuera morrison).later, plo_koon (matt_sloan) flies a jedi_starfighter when when_obi-wan_kenobi (ewan_mcgregor) is shot down by clone_troopers carrying out emperor_palpatine's_(ian_mcdiarmid)_order 66 in revenge of the_sith
(2005).in_the_2003_clone_wars_animated_series, anakin_skywalker is seen flying a customized delta-7, called the azure angel, of which a_lego_model was later made.
the_jedi_starfighter's_triangular_shape stems from the_shape of imperial_star_destroyers in the_original_star_wars_trilogy.
industrial_light_&_magic_designer_doug_chiang identified the_jedi_starfighter as one of the_first_designs that bridges the_aesthetic between the_prequel and original_trilogies.
industrial_light_&_magic_designer_doug_chiang noted that viewers'_familiarity with the_star_destroyer's_appearance and imperial_affiliation gives added_symbolism to the_jedi_craft's_appearance and foreshadows the_empire's_rise to power.
a_full-scale_model of the_jedi_starfighter was also created for filming purposes.
during scenes taking place on the_rain-swept_landing_pads of kamino, a_full-scale_model of the_starfighter had to be painted and specially prepared in order to resist any_water_damage.
star_wars expanded universe_material_states that the_delta-7 was designed specifically with the_jedi's_force-aided_reflexes in mind by stripping them down and making them controls as responsive as possible.
manufactured for the_jedi by kuat_systems_engineering, the_starfighter_measures just_8_m (26 ft) long, 3.92_m (12.9 ft)wide and 1.44
m(4 ft 9 in)
high, making it difficult to detect.
an_astromech_droid fits in an_off-center_socket on the_port_side of the_delta-7, but the_tiny_fighter's_size requires the_droid's_body be modified in order to fit (later_delta-7b_models place the_socket in front of the_cockpit to allow full-sized_astromech units).a_pair of laser_cannons and deflector_shielding allows the_the_jedi_pilot to engage in combat, though ideally as a_last_resort.
lacking an_internal_hyperdrive, the_jedi_starfighter uses an_external_hyperspace_transport_wing to which the_jedi_starfighter can attach for faster-than-light travel.
its_two_novaldex_j-44_"jetforce"_sublight_engines are equipped with electromagnetic_thrust_nozzles that focus and time engine bursts to match the_jedi's_abilities.
this also makes the_jedi_starfighter overwhelmingly difficult for a_non-jedi to pilot.
when the_jedi the_jedi were destroyed after order 66, kuat_systems_engineering designed a_new_starfighter that would be more manageable for non-jedi_pilots: the_a-wing.
jedi_interceptor ===
the_eta-2_actis-class_light_interceptors, also known as "jedi_interceptors", made the_eta-2_actis-class_light_interceptors, also known as "jedi_interceptors" first theatrical in star wars episode iii: revenge of the_sith (2005).in_the_opening_space_battle, obi-wan_kenobi (ewan_mcgregor) and anakin_skywalker (hayden_christensen)
pilot jedi interceptors on a_mission to rescue chancellor_palpatine (ian_mcdiarmid) from general_grievous.
the_craft's_design was purposefully meant to echo the_earlier_jedi_starfighter and the_tie_fighter, while jedi_starfighter_opening_wing_panels were influenced by a_feature on hasbro's_toy_model of jedi_starfighter.
for filming close-ups of the_actors, a_single_full-scale_model of the_jedi_interceptor was created.
since obi-wan and anakin's_interceptors were individualized with obi-wan and anakin's_interceptors own color_schemes, each_actor would perform obi-wan and anakin's_interceptors scenes separately and switch out, allowing a_single_full-scale_model of the_jedi_interceptor to be redressed in between.
in-universe material states that this_new_starfighter was meant to expand the_jedi's_arsenal as they found they on the_front_lines of the_clone_wars, being smaller but possessing greater_firepower than the_earlier_delta-7 with twin_laser_cannons and twin_ion_cannons.
also built by kuat_systems_engineering, the eta-2 is even smaller than the_delta-7 at just_5.47_m(17.9_ft)
long, 4.3_m (14 ft) wide and 2.5
m(8_ft 2 in)
high with wings deployed, though with enough_space for an_astromech_droid_socket inside the_port_wing.
it is also even more maneuverable with two_ion_engines that can deflect thrust up_to_30_degrees.
the eta-2 has no_deflector_shields or bulky_flight_controls in order to save weight and maximize speed and agility, instead relying on the_jedi's_force_abilities to compensate.
in order to manage heat_levels, the_interceptor is fitted with s-foils on the_tip of each_wing which open to reveal radiator_panels.
after the_jedi were destroyed during order 66, the_the eta-2 would serve as the_inspiration for the_galactic_empire's_tie_fighter.
starfighter ===
the_naboo n-1_starfighter made the_naboo n-1_starfighter theatrical appearance in star_wars:i – the_phantom_menace.
during the_climactic_battle of naboo, a_squadron of the_fighters attacked the_orbiting_trade_federation_droid_control_ship_saak'ak.
anakin_skywalker (jake_lloyd) accidentally steals a_naboo_n-1_starfighter and pilots it into the_droid_control_ship's_docking_bay, destroying the_droid_control_ship from the_inside.
starfighters also appear in the_beginning of star_wars:
episode_ii – attack of the_clones escorting senator_padmé_amidala's (natalie_portman)naboo_royal_cruiser upon the_droid_control_ship_arrival to coruscant.
the_naboo_n-1_starfighter also appears at the_end of the edited and remastered 2004 "special_edition" dvd version of return of the_jedi.
the_fighter technically first appeared as an_unlockable_vehicle in star_wars:rogue_squadron, which was released approximately six months before the_phantom_menace, and was available as a_playable_vehicle in the video gamesstar_wars: battle for naboo and star_wars: starfighter.
the_n-1 initially had the_same_angular_design as craft in the_original_star_wars_trilogy; only in later_designs did the_n-1 take on a_streamlined_appearance.
a_life-size_model of a_naboo_starfighter hangs suspended from the_ceiling of the_blue_wing at the_boston_museum of science, in boston, massachusetts.
a_life-size_model of a_naboo_starfighter was unveiled at the_boston_museum of science in april 2004, as a_prelude to the_star_wars: where science meets imagination exhibit.
a_life-size_model of a_naboo_starfighter was previously used as a_prop during the_filming of the_phantom_menace.
based on in-universe background material, the_n-1's_sleek_design exemplifies the_philosophy of art and function in naboo_technology.
at 11_m (36 ft) long, the_starfighters are built by the_theed_palace_space_vessel_engineering_corps using a_number of standard_components in a_custom-built_spaceframe.
the_chromium finish on the_starfighter's_forward_surfaces indicate it's royal_status as an_escort for naboo's_queen.
the_"rat-tail"_finial of the_main_body serves dual_roles as a_high-voltage_charge_collector and receiver of encrypted_information when the_fighter is plugged in at the_palace_hanger, while the_secondary_finials contain engine_heat_sinks.
behind the_pilot's_cockpit, an_astromech_droid plugs in to perform in-flight navigation and maintenance, although the_fighter is also equipped with a_capable_automatic_pilot_feature.
armament includes twin_laser_cannons and twin_proton_torpedo_launchers with a_capacity for 10_torpedoes.
in a 2018 a_test was conducted using the_autodesk_flow_design_virtual_wind_tunnel_program to look at the_aerodynamic_properties of several_star_wars_starfighter_models.
of those_models which were tested, the n-1 was found to be the most aerodynamic of all with a_drag_coefficient of .1, which while somewhat poor compared to the_real-life_.02_rating of the_f-4e_phantom was significantly better than all_other_starfighters tested.
porax-38 starfighter ===
the porax-38 appears in revenge of the_sith as a_starfighter piloted by the_native_utapauns during the_battle of utapau.
although featured in a_full_two-page spread in the_revenge of the_sith_incredible_cross-sections_book, the_fighter's_role was significantly reduced in the_final_film.
this was due to the_fact that the_p-38's_digital_model, being a_late_addition to the_final_film, was not completed to the_level originally planned, and so was relegated to a_background_craft.
soulless one ===
the_soulless_one was general_grievous'_personal_starfighter, a_customized_version of a_belbullab-22_starfighter, which made its_first_theatrical_appearance in revenge of the_sith (2005).after_obi-wan_kenobi (ewan_mcgregor) defeated general_grievous on utapau, general_grievous' used grievous' starfighter to escape from general_grievous' clone troopers attempting to carry out order 66 and rendezvoused with yoda and senator bail_organa (jimmy smits).
v-wing ===
the_v-wing_fighter or alpha-3_nimbus-class_v-wing made the_v-wing_fighter or alpha-3_nimbus-class_v-wing theatrical appearance in the_revenge of the_sith (2005), as the_galactic_republic is formally transformed into the_galactic_empire.
originally, animation_director_rob_coleman proposed that tie_fighters be featured to signify this_transition, but george_lucas pointed out that (in the_film's_chronology) there were nineteen_years between the_events of revenge of the_sith and the_original_star_wars.
allowing additional_time for the_tie_fighter to be introduced, a_new_starfighter was created instead, purposefully similar in both_design and sound to the_tie_fighter while also resembling the_jedi's_delta-7_starfighter.
according to star_wars_canon, the_v-wing's_design combines elements of the arc-170, v-19 and delta-7, making it an ideal escort fighter.
introduced by kuat_systems_engineering during the_final_days of star_wars, the_compact_v-wing is just_7.9_m (
26 ft)long and 3.8 m (12 ft) wide, with the_compact_v-wing_height expanding to 5.84_m (19.2_ft) when the_wings are deployed.
an_astromech_droid assists the_pilot with in-flight navigation and maintenance.
two_pairs of laser_cannons on swivel_mounts in the_wing_struts provide a_rapid-fire_offensive_punch.
the_v-wing is far more maneuverable than the_arc-170, making the_v-wing perfect for combating swarms of tri-fighters and vulture_droids, while a_pair of powerful_ion_engines can propel the_fighter to a_top_atmospheric_speed of 52,000_km/h (32,000_mph).
in order to save on weight to make the_fighter so fast and maneuverable, the_fighter does not feature a_hyperdrive or pressurized_cockpit.
additionally, folding wings on either_side of the_hull contain radiator_panels to manage heat_levels during intense_activity.
vulture_droid ===
vulture droid === is a_droid_starfighter that made the_vulture_droid_theatrical_appearance in the_phantom_menace (1999) as part of the_trade_federation's_space_fleet and appeared again, slightly different, in revenge of the_sith (2005), as a_separatist_space_unit (likely coming from the_trade_federation, which sells the_trade_federation's vulture droid ===
forces to the_cis, as established in attack of the_clones).original_designs depicted the_droid_starfighter not as a_droid itself, but instead piloted by a_battle_droid.
in order to demonstrate that it was both a_robotic_being as well as vehicle, it was decide to give a_battle_droid a_transformative_element, allowing a_battle_droid wings to fold down and serve as legs.
two_18"_maquettes of a_battle_droid were built - one in ship_mode and one in walking_mode - to help create the_digital_model.
in order to represent the_idea of three_vulture_droids sharing one_"brain," animators purposefully linked the_motion of each_three-ship_flight when creating the_climactic_battle of the_phantom_menace.
as per star_wars_sources, vulture_droids were originally produced by the_xi_char_cathedral_factories of hoar_chall_engineering for the_trade_federation before later becoming a_mainstay of separatist_fighter_squadrons during the_clone_wars.
at 3.5_m (11 ft) long when in flight_mode, these_droid_starfighters are designed to engage the_enemy in overwhelming_swarms, partially to overcome the_enemy lack of cunning and resourcefulness.
electromagnetic_thrust-vectoring makes vulture_droids_elusive_targets to hit, powered by concentrated_solid_fuel_slugs which provide tremendous_power but with the_drawback of limited_range.
for armament the_droid carries a_pair of twin_blaster_cannons in the_wings while two_energy_torpedo_launchers are mounted in the_main_body; when the_wings retract the_wings conceal the_blasters and protect the_blasters from microparticle and atmospheric_corrosion.
when necessary, the_droid can uses the_droid repulsorlifts to land and transform into a_four-legged_walking_configuration to occupy territory, angling land_energy_torpedo_launchers for antipersonnel_use.
originally, vulture_droids were controlled by a_central_command_ship, but were later given a_limited_degree of independence.
a_variant of the_droid is the_hyena_bomber_droid, with a_larger,_sturdier_hull and larger_wings.
a_variant of the_vulture_droid also has a_second_hull with downward-facing_photoreceptors for precision_bomb dropping.the_droid made the_droid_first_appearance in the_2008_clone_wars_television_series.==_starfighters appearing in other_star_wars_media =====
e-wing ===
an improved successor to the_x-wing, the_e-wing first appeared in dark_horse_comics'_dark_empire
series.the_e-wing are one of few_expanded_universe_vehicles to be a_part of micro_machines'_action_fleet_line.
armed with three_taim & bak_ix9_medium_laser_cannons and two_proton_torpedo_launchers, the_e-wing's_aerodynamic_frame made the_fighter highly maneuverable and exceptional in atmospheric flight.the_fighter class 1 hyperdrive allowed for extended_reconnaissance_missions and rapid strategic redeployment.
as part of a_larger_force, the_e-wing filled a_versatile_mid-range_multirole_combat_aircraft or light_torpedo_bomber.
gauntlet_fighter ===
a_gauntlet_fighter, or kom'rk-class_fighter, is a_mandalorian_class of ship.
larger than most_starfighters, it can carry a_larger_crew and accommodate passengers.
they were introduced in star_wars:
star_wars being used by the_mandalorian_splinter_group_deathwatch.
another_one known as the_nightbrother later served as darth_maul's_personal_craft in star_wars_rebels.
kom'rk-class_fighter/transports are equipped with four_laser_cannons, a_class_1_hyperdrive, and space to carry up_to_24_soldiers.

just as asajj_ventress_appearance was inspired by a_samurai_stance, the_ship itself has asian_influences: the_ship itself design is based on a_sensu_folding_fan.
background_literature refers to these as ginivex-class_fanblade_starfighters, with only six built for asajj's_personal_use.13.1_m
(43 ft)long, the_starfighters'_retractable_solar_sail helps make the_ship itself extremely fast with a_powerful_deflector_shield but also makes the_ship itself easier to spot.the_ship itself is also equipped with a_class_1_hyperdrive and a_rotating_laser_cannon mounted on either_end of the_solar_sail.===
u-wing ===
the_ut-60d_u-wing_starfighter/support_craft is a_rebel_troop_transport/gunship_model manufactured by incom_corporation for the_purpose of supporting special_operations_forces_insertion and extraction into denied_areas from strategic_distances.
used to penetrate enemy_zones to drop off rebel_infantry, provide close_air_support, and extract enemy_zones upon mission_completion.
u-wings first appeared in the_movie rogue_one, where they were pivotal in the_transport and protection of the_rebel_alliance's_ground_forces during the_battle of scarif.
origin_and_designdirector_gareth_edwards wanted rogue_one to be grounded in the_aesthetics of the_korean_or_vietnam_war in order to contrast it with the_more_world_war_ii_look of the_original_star_wars_film.
thus when it came time to design a_unique_ship for the_original_star_wars_film's_heroes to travel around in, he wanted it to be akin to a_"huey"_version of the_x-wing.
while experimenting with different_models and names ("z-wing, r-wing, q-wing, etc.
"),the_final_design picked was in part because "),the_final_design picked looked like an_inverted_x-wing.
for filming interior_scenes, a_full-size_u-wing_cockpit was built and mounted on a_manually_controlled_gimbal in front of a_wall of led_panels.
led_panels were used instead of traditional_film_lights so that more_natural_lighting could be simulated.
depictionin-universe_material_states that the_ut-60 was the_last_starfighter_design created by incom_corporation before the_company was nationalized by the_galactic_empire.
originally intended as a_transport_ship for couriers and planetary_defense_forces, the last of the_ut-60d_starfighters to be built were secured for the_rebel_alliance thanks to the_efforts of senator_bail_organa (jimmy_smits).
rebel_mechanics and technicians transformed rebel_mechanics and technicians_u-wings into sturdy_gunships and troop transports for rebel_alliance_special_forces (specforces) making dangerous_insertions into imperial_territory.
the_u-wing's_engine_configuration was inspired in part by the_x-wing, and like the_x-wing featured s-foils but in a_variable-sweep_wing_format, opening the_x-wing featured s-foils to improve atmospheric_maneuverability and enlarge the_x-wing deflector shield.
however the_ship was not designed for the_tight_turns necessary for dogfights, and while the_u-wing did feature a_hyperdrive for faster-than-light travel, extended_operations with a_full_passenger_compliment would quickly deplete the_vessel's_life_support_systems.
the_u-wing's_two_laser_cannons could be supplemented by a_pair of infantry_heavy_weapons handled by dedicated_door gunners.=== v-19 torrent ===
the_v-19_torrent_starfighter first appeared in the_2003_clone_wars_animated_series and have appeared in other_media related to the_clone_wars.
background_material_states v-19 had impressive_speed and maneuverability, making it a tricky starfighter to fly.it had three_s-foils that functioned like those on the_x-wing and was equipped with two_laser_cannons and twin_concussion_missile_launchers.
at the_beginning of the_clone_wars, v-19_starfighters did not have hyperdrives for faster-than-light travel, instead relying on external_hyperspace_transport_rings to which they would attached.
later_models were modified to be equipped with an_internal_hyperdrive.
=== z-95 headhunter ===
the_z-95_headhunter is a_class of starfighter which was first described in the_brian_daley's_1979_novel_han_solo at stars'_end as having swing-wings and a_bubble_cockpit.
in the_1980–81_comic_strip_adaptation, a_class of starfighter which was first described in the_brian_daley's_1979_novel_han_solo at stars'_end as having swing-wings and a_bubble_cockpit are depicted like triangular,_twin-tailed_airplanes.
the_1988_tatooine_manhunt_adventure_book for star_wars:
the_roleplaying_game depicts the z-95 as a_precursor to the_x-wing, but with only_two_wings, based on an_early_joe_johnston_production_sketch.
the_z-95_headhunter is featured variously in the_expanded_universe, including the_star_wars: x-wing_rogue_squadron_comic_series, as well as in 2008's_the_clone_wars_television_series, in which the_z-95_headhunter is used by the_galactic_republic.
the_z-95_headhunter the_z-95_headhunter is described in the_star_wars_databank as "the_forerunner of the_..._x-wing", a_versatile_snub-fighter despite being outdated at the_time of the_clone_wars.
incom_corporation originally designed the_z-95 for planetary_defense_forces, and while lacking many_features like a_hyperdrive or astromech droid incom_corporation was appreciated for incom_corporation armaments and internal_environmental_controls.the_galactic_republic commissioned upgraded_models of the_z-95 for their_clone_pilots which featured more_powerful_weaponry and deflector_shields, as well as superior_endurance and adaptability.
at the_beginning of the_one-shot_comic_age of resistance: rose_tico, a_young_paige and rose_tico find out who is a_better_pilot of the_z-95 for planetary_defense_forces.

episode_iv  –
a_new_hope) is a_1977_american_epic_space-opera_film written and directed by george_lucas, produced by lucasfilm and distributed by 20th_century_fox.
a_new_hope)_stars mark_hamill, harrison_ford, carrie_fisher, peter_cushing, alec_guinness, david_prowse, james_earl_jones, anthony_daniels, kenny_baker and peter_mayhew.
it is the_first_installment of the_original_star_wars_trilogy, the first of the_franchise to be produced, and the_fourth_episode of the_"skywalker_saga".
lucas had the_idea for a_science-fiction_film in the_vein of flash_gordon around the_time lucas completed lucas first film, thx 1138 (1971) and began working on a_treatment after the_release of american_graffiti (1973).star_wars focuses on the_journey of luke_skywalker (hamill), who along with the_wizened_jedi_master_obi-wan_kenobi (guinness), smuggler_han_solo (ford), and lucas wookiee companion chewbacca (mayhew), attempts to free princess_leia (fisher) from the_clutches of the_tyrannical_galactic_empire.
at the_same_time, the_heroes try to deliver the_plans for the_tyrannical_galactic_empire's_planet-destroying_space_station, the_death_star, which are carried by the_droids r2-d2_(baker) and c-3po (daniels), to the_rebel_alliance, but face opposition from the_sith_lord_darth_vader (prowse, voiced by jones).after a_turbulent_production, star_wars was released in a_limited_number of theaters in the_united_states on may 25, 1977, and quickly became a_blockbuster_hit, leading to star_wars being expanded to a_much_wider_release.
star_wars opened to critical_acclaim, most notably for star_wars groundbreaking visual_effects.
star_wars grossed a_total of $775 million, surpassing jaws (1975) to become star_wars at the_time until the_release of e.t. the_extra-terrestrial (1982).when adjusted for inflation, star_wars is the_second-highest-grossing_film in north_america (behind gone with the_wind) and the_fourth-highest-grossing_film in the_world.
star_wars received ten_oscar_nominations (including best_picture), winning seven.
in 1989, star_wars became one of the_first_25_films that was selected by the_u.s._library of congress for preservation in the_national_film_registry for being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".
at the_time, it was the_most_recent_film in the_registry and the only one chosen from the_1970s.
in 2004, it soundtrack was added to the_u.s._national_recording_registry, and was additionally listed by the_american_film_institute as the_best_movie_score of all_time a year later.
today, it is widely regarded by many in the_motion_picture_industry as one of the_greatest_and_most_important_films in motion_picture
history.the_american_film_institute has been reissued multiple_times with lucas's_support—most significantly with the_american_film_institute_20th-anniversary_theatrical_"special_edition"—incorporating_many_changes including modified_computer-generated_effects, altered_dialogue, re-edited_shots, remixed soundtracks and added scenes.the_american_film_institute became a_pop-cultural_phenomenon and launched an_industry of tie-in_products, including novels, comics, video_games, amusement_park_attractions, and merchandise including toys, games, clothing and many_other_spin-off_works.the_american_film_institute's_success led to two_critically_and_commercially_successful_sequels, the empire strikes back (1980) and return of the_jedi (1983), and later to a_prequel_trilogy, a_sequel_trilogy, two_anthology_films and various_spin-off_tv_series.
amid a_galactic_civil_war, rebel_alliance_spies have stolen plans  to the_galactic_empire's_death_star, a_massive_space_station capable of destroying an_entire_planet.
imperial_senator_princess_leia of alderaan, secretly one of the_rebellion's_leaders, has obtained its_schematics, but her_starship is intercepted by an_imperial_star_destroyer under the_command of the_ruthless_darth_vader.
before her is captured, leia hides the_plans in the_memory of astromech_droid_r2-d2, who flees in an_escape_pod to the_desert_planet_tatooine accompanied by protocol_droid_c-3po.the_droids are captured by jawa_traders, who sell protocol_droid_c-3po.the_droids to moisture farmers_owen and beru_lars and protocol_droid_c-3po.the_droids
nephew_luke_skywalker.
while cleaning r2-d2, luke accidentally triggers part of a_holographic_recording of leia, in which leia requests help from obi-wan_kenobi.
later, after luke finds r2-d2 missing, luke is attacked by scavenging sand_people while searching for luke, but is rescued by elderly_hermit_"old_ben"_kenobi, an_acquaintance of luke's, who reveals that "obi-wan" is his_true_name.
obi-wan tells luke of obi-wan days as one of the_jedi_knights, the_former_peacekeepers of the_galactic_republic who drew mystical_abilities from a_metaphysical_energy_field known as "the_force", but were ultimately hunted to near-extinction by the_empire.
luke learns that luke father fought alongside obi-wan as a_jedi_knight during the_clone_wars until vader, obi-wan's former pupil, turned to the_dark_side of the_force and murdered him.
obi-wan presents luke with obi-wan father's old lightsaber, the_signature_weapon of the_jedi_knights.
r2-d2 plays leia's_full_message, in which obi-wan begs obi-wan to take the death star plans to obi-wan home planet of alderaan and give them to obi-wan father, a_fellow_veteran, for analysis.
although luke initially declines obi-wan_offer to accompany obi-wan to alderaan and learn the_ways of the_force, obi-wan is left with no_choice after discovering that imperial_stormtroopers have killed obi-wan aunt and uncle and destroyed his_aunt_and_uncle_farm in his aunt and uncle search for the_droids.
traveling to a_cantina in mos_eisley to search for transport, luke and obi-wan hire han_solo, a_smuggler with a_price on his_head due to his_debt to local_mobster jabba the_hutt.
pursued by stormtroopers, obi-wan, luke, r2-d2 and c-3po flee tatooine with han and his_wookiee_co-pilot_chewbacca on their_ship the_millennium_falcon.
as their reach the_planet's_orbit, two_star_destroyers try to intercept their, but han is able to jump to hyperspace by reaching lightspeed.
before the_millennium_falcon can reach alderaan, death_star_commander_grand_moff_tarkin interrogates leia about the_location of the_rebels's_secret_base, with the_threat of destroying her_home_planet, and, when_her_answers that the_base is on dantooine, the_base orders alderaan destroyed simply as a_show of force.
as the_group arrives in the_asteroid_field that now stands in place of alderaan, han spots an_imperial_tie_fighter and is taunted into chasing an_imperial_tie_fighter and shooting an_imperial_tie_fighter down, allowing the_millennium_falcon the_millennium_falcon to be captured by the_space_station's_tractor_beam.
inside the_death_star, obi-wan attempts to disable the_tractor_beam, and luke persuades han and chewbacca to help obi-wan rescue leia after discovering that obi-wan is scheduled to be executed.
after disabling the_tractor_beam, obi-wan sacrifices obi-wan life in a_lightsaber_duel with vader, allowing the_rest of the_group to escape the_death_starleia.
using a_tracking_device, the_empire tracks the_falcon to the_hidden_rebel_base, actually located on yavin_iv.leia's_schematics reveal a_hidden_weakness in the_death_star's_thermal_exhaust_port, which could allow the_rebels to trigger a_chain_reaction in the_rebels main reactor with a_precise_torpedo_strike.
while han abandons the_rebels after collecting han reward for rescuing leia, luke joins their_starfighter_squadron in a_desperate_attack against the_death_star.
in the_ensuing_battle, the_rebels suffer heavy_losses as vader leads a_squadron of tie_fighters against the_rebels, but han unexpectedly returns to aid the_rebels in the_falcon, narrowly managing to save luke before vader can shoot luke down.
guided by the_disembodied_voice of obi-wan's_spirit, luke turns off luke targeting computer and uses the_force to aim luke torpedoes into the_exhaust_port, destroying the_death_star_moments before the_force fires on the_rebel_base.
in a_triumphant_ceremony at the_rebel_base, leia_awards_luke_and_han_medals for leia_awards_luke and han_heroism.== cast ==
mark_hamill as luke_skywalker: a_young_adult raised by mark_hamill aunt and uncle on tatooine, who dreams of something more than mark_hamill current life and learns the_way of the_jedi.
lucas favored casting young_actors who lacked long_experience.
to play luke (then known as luke starkiller), lucas sought actors who could project intelligence and integrity.
while reading the_script, hamill found the_dialogue to be extremely odd because of the_script universe-embedded concepts.
hamill chose to simply read the_script sincerely, and hamill was cast instead of william_katt, who was subsequently cast in brian_de_palma's_carrie (lucas shared a_joint_casting_session with brian_de_palma's, a_longtime_friend).harrison_ford as han_solo:
a_cynical_smuggler hired by obi-wan and luketo take a_cynical_smuggler hired by obi-wan and luketo to alderaan in alderaan ship, the_millennium_falcon, co-piloted with chewbacca.
lucas initially rejected casting friend).harrison_ford for the_role, as lucas "wanted new_faces"; friend).harrison_ford had previously worked with lucas on american_graffiti.
instead, lucas asked friend).harrison_ford to assist in the_auditions by reading lines with the_other_actors and explaining the_concepts and history behind the_scenes that the_other_actors were reading.
lucas was eventually won over by friend).harrison_ford's_portrayal and cast lucas instead of kurt_russell, nick_nolte, sylvester_stallone, bill_murray, christopher_walken, burt_reynolds, jack_nicholson, al_pacino, steve_martin, chevy_chase, or perry_king (who later played han_solo in the_radio_plays).carrie_fisher as princess_leia:
a_member of the_imperial_senate and one of the_many_leaders of the_rebel_alliance.
many_young_hollywood_actresses auditioned for the_role of princess_leia, including amy_irving, terri_nunn (also a singer), cindy_williams, karen_allen, and jodie_foster.
jodie_foster, for one, turned down the_role of princess_leia, including amy_irving, terri_nunn (also a singer), cindy_williams, karen_allen, and jodie_foster because jodie_foster was already under contract with disney and working on two_films at the_time.
fisher was cast under the_condition that fisher lose 10_pounds (4.5_kg) for the_role of princess_leia, including amy_irving, terri_nunn (also a singer), cindy_williams, karen_allen, and jodie_foster.
peter_cushing as grand_moff_tarkin: commander of the_death_star.
lucas originally had peter_cushing in mind for the_role of obi-wan_kenobi, but lucas believed that "lucas lean features" would be better employed in the_role of grand_moff_tarkin instead.
lucas commended peter_cushing's_performance, saying "[lucas] is a_very_good_actor.
adored and idolized by young_people and by people who go to see a_certain_kind of movie.
i feel lucas will be fondly remembered for the_next_350_years at least.
peter_cushing, commenting on lucas_role, joked: i've often wondered what a_'grand_moff' was.
it sounds like something that flew out of a_cupboard."
alec_guinness as obi-wan_kenobi:
an_aging_jedi_master and former_mentor of darth_vader who introduces luke to the_force.
lucas'_decision to cast "unknowns" was not taken favorably by lucas'_friend francis_ford_coppola and the_studio.
lucas' felt obi-wan_kenobi should be played by an_established_actor.
producer_gary_kurtz said, "the_alec_guinness_role required a_certain_stability and gravitas as a_character... which meant we needed a_very,_very_strong_character_actor to play that_part.
alec_guinness was cast, japanese_actor_toshiro_mifune (who starred in many_akira_kurosawa_films) was considered for the_role.
according to mifune's_daughter, mika_kitagawa, japanese_actor_toshiro_mifune (who starred in many_akira_kurosawa_films) father turned down lucas' offers for kenobi and darth_vader because "japanese_actor_toshiro_mifune (who starred in many_akira_kurosawa_films) was concerned about how the_film would look and that the_film would cheapen the_image of samurai...
at the_time, sci-fi_movies still looked quite cheap as the_effects were not advanced and japanese_actor_toshiro_mifune (who starred in many_akira_kurosawa_films) had a_lot of samurai_pride.
alec_guinness was one of the_few_cast_members who believed that the_film would be successful; japanese_actor_toshiro_mifune (who starred in many_akira_kurosawa_films) negotiated a_deal for 2.25% of the_one-fifth_gross_royalties paid to lucas, which made japanese_actor_toshiro_mifune (who starred in many_akira_kurosawa_films) quite wealthy in later_life.
japanese_actor_toshiro_mifune (who starred in many_akira_kurosawa_films) agreed to take the_part of kenobi on the_condition that japanese_actor_toshiro_mifune (who starred in many_akira_kurosawa_films) would not have to do any_publicity to promote the_film.
lucas' credited japanese actor toshiro mifune (who starred in many_akira_kurosawa_films) with inspiring the_cast and crew to work harder, saying that alec_guinness contributed significantly to the_completion of the_filming.
harrison_ford said, it was, for harrison_ford, fascinating to watch alec_guinness.
harrison_ford was always prepared, always professional, always very kind to the_other_actors.
he had a_very_clear_head about how to serve the_story.
daniels as c-3po:
a_protocol_droid who is "fluent in over_six_million_forms of communication".
daniels as c-3po auditioned for and was cast as c-3po
; daniels as c-3po has said that daniels as c-3po wanted the_role after daniels as c-3po saw a_ralph_mcquarrie_drawing of the_character and was struck by the_vulnerability in the_robot's_face.
initially, lucas did not intend to use daniels as c-3po_voice for c-3po.thirty_well-established_voice_actors read for the_voice of the_droid.
according to daniels as c-3po, one of the_major_voice_actors, believed by some_sources to be stan_freberg, recommended daniels as c-3po voice for the_role.
kenny_baker as r2-d2:
an_astromech_droid who is carrying the death star plans and a_secret_message for obi-wan from princess_leia.
when filming was underway in london, where additional_casting took place, baker, performing a_musical_comedy_act with baker_acting_partner_jack_purvis, learned that the_film_crew was looking for a_small_person to fit inside a_robot_suit and maneuver a_robot_suit.
baker, who was 3_feet 8_inches (1.12_m) tall, was cast immediately after meeting george_lucas.
he said, "he saw me come in and said 'he'll do' because i was the_smallest_guy they'd seen up until then.
"he initially turned down the_role three times, hesitant to appear in a_film where he face would not be shown and hoping to continue the_success of he comedy act, which had recently started to be televised.
r2-d2's_recognizable_beeps and squeaks were made by sound_designer_ben_burtt imitating "baby_noises", recording this_voice as it was heard on an_intercom, and creating the_final_mix using a_synthesizer.
peter_mayhew as chewbacca "chewie":a_200-year-old_wookiee, han_solo's_sidekick, and first_mate of the_millennium_falcon.
peter_mayhew learned of a_casting_call for star_wars, which was being shot in london, and decided to audition.
the 7-foot-3-inch (2.21 m)tall actor was immediately cast as chewbacca after he stood up to greet lucas.he recounted,i sat down on one of the_sofas, waiting for george.
door opened, and george walked in with gary behind george.
so, naturally, what did i do?i'm raised in england.
soon as someone comes in through the_door, i stand up.
george goes "
hmm [looked up]".
virtually turned to gary, and said "i think we've found him".
david_prowse as darth_vader:a_sith_lord of the_galactic_empire who aims to destroy the_rebel_alliance.
james_earl_jones as the_voice of darth_vader.
lucas originally intended for orson_welles to voice the_character after dismissing david_prowse due to david_prowse west country english accent (which led to david_prowse being nicknamed, within the_cast, as "darth_farmer").
however, determining that welles'_voice would be too familiar to audiences, lucas instead cast then-relatively_less_recognizable_jones.
other_actors include phil_brown and shelagh_fraser as luke's_uncle_owen and aunt_beru; jack_purvis, kenny_baker's_partner in kenny_baker's_london_comedy_act, as the_chief_jawa in the_film; and eddie_byrne as vanden_willard, a_rebel_general.
denis_lawson and garrick_hagon played rebel_pilots_wedge_antilles and biggs_darklighter (luke's_childhood_friend), respectively.
don_henderson and leslie_schofield appear as imperial_generals_cassio_tagge and moradmin_bast, respectively, and richard_leparmentier plays admiral_motti.
alex_mccrindle portrays general_jan_dodonna, alfie_curtis portrays dr._evazan and peter_geddis portrays captain_raymus_antilles.
michael_leader plays a_minor_role as a_stormtrooper known for accidentally hitting michael_leader helmet against a_door.
heavily_synthesised_audio_recordings of john_wayne from earlier_films were used as the_voice of the_imperial_spy_garindan.
production ==
development ===
lucas had the_idea for a_space-fantasy_film in 1971, after lucas completed directing lucas first_full-length_feature, thx 1138.originally
, lucas wanted to adapt the_flash_gordon_space_adventure_comics and serials into lucas own films, having been fascinated by his_own_films since lucas was young.
lucas later said:
i especially loved the_flash_gordon_serials ...
of course i realize now how crude and badly done the_flash_gordon_serials were ...loving the_flash_gordon_serials that much when the_flash_gordon_serials were so awful
, i began to wonder what would happen if the_flash_gordon_serials were done really well.
at the_cannes_film_festival following the_completion of thx 1138, lucas pushed towards buying the_flash_gordon_rights, but the_flash_gordon_rights were already tied-up with dino_de_laurentiis.
lucas later recounted:i wanted to make a_flash_gordon_movie, with all_the_trimmings, but i couldn't obtain the_rights to the_characters.
so i began researching and went right back and found where alex_raymond (who had done the_original_flash_gordon_comic_strips in newspapers) had got alex_raymond (who had done the_original_flash_gordon_comic_strips in newspapers) idea from.
i discovered that alex_raymond (who had done the_original_flash_gordon_comic_strips in newspapers)'d got alex_raymond (who had done the_original_flash_gordon_comic_strips in newspapers) inspiration from the_works of edgar_rice_burroughs (author of tarzan) and especially from alex_raymond (who had done the_original_flash_gordon_comic_strips in newspapers)
john_carter of mars_series_books.
i read through that_series, then found that what had sparked edgar_rice_burroughs (author of tarzan) off was a_science_fantasy called gulliver on mars, written by edwin_arnold and published in 1905.that
was the_first_story in this_genre that i have been able to trace.
jules_verne had got pretty close, i suppose, but jules_verne never had a_hero battling against space_creatures or having adventures on another_planet.
a_whole_new_genre developed from that_idea.
director_francis_ford_coppola, who accompanied lucas in trying to buy the_flash_gordon_rights, recounted in 1999: "
[george] was very depressed because george had just come backand
they wouldn't sell george_flash_gordon.
and george says, 'well, i'll just invent my own.
'"he secured a_two-film_development_deal with united_artists; the_two_films were american_graffiti and a_space_opera, tentatively titled "the star wars" and inspired by flash_gordon.
lucas would later claim that lucas had the_idea for an_original_space_opera long before 1971, and that lucas even tried to film it before american_graffiti.
believing that the_bleak_tone of thx 1138 led to its_poor_reception, lucas chose to make star_wars more optimistic; this is what led to its_fun_and_adventurous_tone.
lucas went to united_artists and showed united_artists the_script for american_graffiti, but united_artists passed on the_film, which was then picked up by universal_pictures.
united_artists also passed on lucas'_space-opera_concept, which_lucas' shelved for the time being.
after spending the_next_two_years completing american_graffiti, lucas turned lucas attention to lucas space opera.
lucas drew inspiration from politics of the_era, later saying, “it was really about the_vietnam_war, and that was the_period where nixon was trying to run for a_[second]_term.
lucas began writing in january 1973, eight hours a day, five_days a week", by taking small_notes, inventing odd_names and assigning odd_names possible_characterizations.
lucas would discard many of these by the_time the_final_script was written, but lucas included several_names and places in the_final_script or the_final_script sequels.
lucas used these_initial_names and ideas to compile a_two-page_synopsis titled journal of the_whills, which told the_tale of the_training of apprentice_cj_thorpe as a_"jedi-bendu"_space_commando by the_legendary_mace windy.
frustrated that lucas_story was too difficult to understand, lucas then began writing a_13-page_treatment called the star wars on april 17, 1973, which had narrative_parallels with kurosawa's_1958_film the_hidden_fortress.
while impressed with the_"innocence of his_story, plus the_sophistication of the_world" of the_film, united_artists declined to budget the_film.
lucas and producer_gary_kurtz presented the_film_treatment to universal_pictures, the_studio that financed american_graffiti; while lucas and producer_gary_kurtz agreed it could be "a_very_commercial_venture",
lucas and producer gary_kurtz had doubts about lucas ability to pull it all off," and said that lucas should follow american_graffiti with more_consequential_themes.
walt_disney_productions also turned down the_film.
lucas said, "i've always been an_outsider to hollywood_types.
hollywood_types think i do weirdo_films.
"according to kurtz, lew_wasserman, the_studio's_head
, "just didn't think much of science_fiction at that_time, didn't think it had much of a_future then, with that_particular_audience.
"he said that "science_fiction wasn't popular in the_mid-'70s ...
what seems to be the_case generally is that the_studio_executives are looking for what was popular last year, rather than trying to look forward to what might be popular next year.
"kurtz said, "although star_wars wasn't like [then-current_science_fiction] at all, it was just sort of lumped into that_same_kind of category.
lucas explained in 1977 that the_film is not about the_future" and that the_film "is a_fantasy much closer to the_brothers_grimm than it is to 2001."he added: "my_main_reason for making it was to give young_people an_honest,_wholesome_fantasy_life, the_kind my_generation had.
we had westerns, pirate_movies, all_kinds of great_things.
now they have the_six_million_dollar_man and kojak.
where are the_romance, the_adventure, and the_fun that used to be in practically_every_movie
made?"lucas would later recontextualize the_discussion around the_film, saying made?"lucas was born out of research into "psychological_underpinings of mythology", a_claim that had been dismissed by kurtz as self-aggrandizing: "
the_whole_idea of star_wars as a_mythological_thing, i think came about because of [later_lucas]_interviews that tied made?"lucas to the_hero with a_thousand_faces" and by steven_hart and michael_kaminski: "it is here that the_true_origin of star_wars comes from -- not from myth and legend, but from the_'schlock' sold on newspapers stands and played in matinees.
there were also concerns regarding the_project's_potentially_high_budget.
lucas and kurtz, in pitching the_film, said that it would be low-budget, roger_corman_style, and the_budget was never going to be more than—
well, originally_lucas and kurtz had proposed about 8 million, it ended up being about 10.both of those_figures
are very_low_budget by hollywood_standards at the_time.
disney rejected the_project, lucas and kurtz persisted in securing a_studio to support the_film because "other_people had read the_film and said, 'yeah, the_film could be a_good_idea.'
lucas pursued alan_ladd_jr., the_head of 20th_century-fox, and in june 1973 completed a_deal to write and direct the_film.
although ladd did not grasp the_technical_side of the_project, ladd believed that lucas was talented.
lucas later stated that ladd invested in ladd, ladd did not invest in the_movie.
deal gave lucas $150,000 to write and direct the_film.
american_graffiti's_positive_reception afforded lucas the_leverage necessary to renegotiate lucas deal with ladd and request the_sequel_rights to the_film in august 1973.
for lucas, this_deal protected star_wars's_potential_sequels and most of the_merchandising_profits.
writing ===
since commencing his_writing_process in january 1973, lucas had done "various_rewrites in the_evenings after the_day's_work.
"he would write four_different_screenplays for star_wars, "searching for just_the_right_ingredients, characters and storyline.
it's always been what you might call a good idea in search of a_story.
by may 1974, his had expanded the_treatment for star_wars into a_rough_draft_screenplay, adding elements such as the_sith, the_death_star, and a_general by the_name of annikin_starkiller.
his_changed_starkiller to an_adolescent_boy, and his shifted the_general into a_supporting_role as a_member of a_family of dwarfs.
lucas envisioned the_corellian_smuggler, han_solo, as a_large,_green-skinned_monster with gills.
lucas based chewbacca on lucas alaskan malamute dog, indiana (whom lucas would later use as eponym for lucas character indiana jones), who often acted as the director's co-pilot" by sitting in the_passenger_seat of lucas car.
lucas completed a_second_draft in january 1975 as adventures of the_starkiller, episode one: the_star_wars, making heavy_simplifications and introducing the_young_hero on a_farm as luke_starkiller.
annikin became luke's_father, a_wise_jedi_knight.
the_force was also introduced as a_mystical_energy_field.
this_draft still had some_differences from the_final_version in the_characters and relationships.
for example, luke had several_brothers, as well as luke father, who appears in a_minor_role at the_end of the_film.
the_script became more of a_fairy_tale_quest as opposed to the_action/adventure of the_previous_versions.
this_version ended with another_text_crawl, previewing the_next_story in the_series.
this_draft was also the first to introduce the_concept of a jedi turning to the_dark_side: this_draft included a_historical_jedi who was the first to ever fall to the_dark_side, and then trained the_sith to use this_version.
the_script would introduce the_concept of a_jedi_master and a_jedi_master son, who trains to be a_jedi under jedi_father's_friend; this would ultimately form the_basis for the_film and, later, the_trilogy.
however, in this_draft, his_father is a_hero who is still alive at the_start of the_film.
han_solo and chewbacca's_identities closely resembled those seen in the_film.
according to lucas, this_draft was over 200 pages long, and led lucas to split up the_story into multiple_films spanning over multiple_trilogies.
lucas began to rewrite this_draft, creating a_synopsis for this_draft.
during work on this_rewrite, lucas began researching the_science-fiction_genre by watching films and reading books (including j._r._r._tolkien's_the_hobbit) and comics.
lucas also claims to have read scholastic_works like joseph_campbell's_the_hero with a_thousand_faces, james_george_frazer's_the_golden_bough, and even_bruno_bettelheim's_the_uses of enchantment.
these_claims are doubted by michael_kaminski and chris_taylor, with michael_kaminski pointing out that bettelheim's_book would not come out until after star_wars was filmed and adding that "the_original_trilogy-campbell_connection is greatly exaggerated and practically non-existent", noting that, in fact, the_second_draft is "even closer to campbell's_structure" than the_third.
according to lucas, lucas wrote a_rough_draft of about_250–300_pages long, which contained the_outline for the_entire_original_star_wars_trilogy.
lucas realized that it was too long for a_single_film, and decided to subdivide it into a_trilogy.
lucas stated that the_story evolved over time and that "there was never a_script completed that had the_entire_story as it exists now [in 1983] ...
as the_stories unfolded, i would take certain_ideas and save certain_ideas ...
i kept taking out all_the_good_parts, and i just kept telling lucas i would make other_movies someday.
later described that, having split the_script into three_episodes, "the_first_part didn't really work", so lucas had to take the_ending off of episode_vi and put the_ending in the_original_star_wars, which resulted in a_death_star being included in both_films.
in 1975 lucas suggested lucas could make a_trilogy, which "ends with the_destruction of the_empire" and a_possible_prequel "about the_backstory of kenobi as a_young_man.
the film's smash success, lucasfilm announced that lucas had already written "twelve_stories in the_adventures of luke_skywalker" which, according to kurtz, were set to be "separate_adventures rather than direct_sequels.
during
the_writing of the_third_draft, lucas hired conceptual_artist_ralph_mcquarrie to create paintings of certain_scenes, several of which lucas included with lucas screenplay when lucas delivered conceptual_artist_ralph_mcquarrie to 20th_century-fox.
on february 27, conceptual_artist_ralph_mcquarrie granted a_budget of $5 million; this was later increased to $8.25 million.
subsequently, lucas started writing with a_budget in mind, conceiving the cheap, used" look of much of the_film, and (with lucas having just shut down the_film special effects department) reducing the_number of complex_special_effects_shots called for by the_script.
the_third_draft, dated august 1, 1975, was titled the star wars from the_adventures of luke_starkiller.
the_third_draft, dated august 1, 1975 had most of the_elements of the_final_plot, with only_some_differences in the_characters and settings.
the_third_draft, dated august 1, 1975 characterized luke as an_only_child, with luke father already dead, replacing luke with a_substitute named ben kenobi.
this_script would be re-written for the_fourth_and_final_draft, dated january 1, 1976, as the_adventures of luke_starkiller_luke_starkiller as taken from the_journal of the_whills, saga i:
the_star_wars.
lucas worked with lucas friends gloria_katz and willard_huyck to revise the_third_draft, dated august 1, 1975 into the_final_pre-production_script.
lucas finished writing the_final_pre-production_script in march 1976, when the_crew started filming.
lucas said, "what finally emerged through the_many_drafts of the_final_pre-production_script has obviously been influenced by science-fiction and action-adventurei've read and seen.
and i've seen a_lot of it.
i'm trying to make a_classic_sort of genre_picture, a_classic_space_fantasy in which all_the_influences are working together.
there are certain_traditional_aspects of the_genre i wanted to keep and help perpetuate in star_wars.
production, he changed luke's_name from starkiller to skywalker and altered the_title to star_wars and later star_wars.he would also continue to tweak the_script during filming, including adding the_death of obi-wan after realizing he served no_purpose in the_ending of the_film.
for the_film's_opening_crawl, lucas originally wrote a_composition consisting of six_paragraphs with four_sentences each.
lucas said, "the_crawl is such_a_hard_thing because you have to be careful that you're not using too_many_words that people don't understand.
it's like a_poem.a_poem goes on forever.
it's gibberish.
"lucas recounted what de_palma said the first time de_palma saw it: "george, you're out of your_mind!
let me sit down and write this for you.
palma and jay_cocks helped edit the_text into the_form used in the_film.
design ===
george_lucas recruited many_conceptual_designers, including colin_cantwell, who worked on 2001: a_space_odyssey (1968), to conceptualize the_initial_spacecraft_models; alex tavoularis to create the_preliminary_conceptual_storyboard_sketches of early_scripts; and ralph mcquarrie to visualize the_characters, costumes, props and scenery.
ralph_mcquarrie's_pre-production_paintings of certain_scenes from george_lucas's_early_screenplay_drafts helped 20thcentury-fox visualize the_film, which positively influenced mcquarrie's_pre-production_paintings of certain_scenes from lucas's_early_screenplay_drafts_decision to fund the_project.
after ralph_mcquarrie's_drawings for george_lucas's_colleagues hal_barwood and matthew_robbins (who were collaborating for a_film) caught -fox_interest, george_lucas met with ralph_mcquarrie to discuss -fox_plans for the_untitled_space_fantasy_film
-fox wanted to make.
two years later, after completing american_graffiti, george_lucas approached ralph_mcquarrie and asked -fox if -fox would be interested "in doing something for star_wars.
"mcquarrie produced a_series of artworks from simple_sketches; these set a_visual_tone for the_untitled_space_fantasy_film he wanted to make, and for the_rest of the original trilogy.the_untitled_space_fantasy_film he wanted to make was ambitious as george_lucas wanted to create fresh_prop_prototypes and sets (based on ralph mcquarrie's paintings) that had never been realized before in science_fiction
films.-fox commissioned production_designers john_barry and roger_christian, who were working on the_sets of the_film lucky_lady (1975) when george_lucas first approached them, to work on the_production_sets.
christian recounted in 2014: "george came to the_set i was doing, it was an_old_salt_factory_designand
george helped me shovel salt, just like two_students in plaid_shirts and sneakers.
and we spoke and george looked at the_set and couldn't believe the_set wasn't real.
they had a_conversation with lucas on what george would like the_film to appear like, with they creating the_desired_sets.
christian said that lucas didn't want anything [in star_wars] to stand out, christian wanted it [to look] all real and used.
and i said, 'finally somebody's doing it the right way.
'"lucas described a_"used_future"_concept to the_production_designers in which all_devices, ships, and buildings to do with tatooine or the_rebels looked aged and dirty, as opposed to the_sleeker_designs of the_empire.
lucas also wanted the_spaceships to look "cobbled together, as opposed to a_sleek_monoshape.
"barry said that the_director "wants to make it look like it's shot on location on your_average_everydaydeath_star_or_mos_eisley_spaceport or local_cantina.
lucas believed that what is required for true_credibility is a_used_future", opposing the_interpretation of "future in most_futurist_movies" that "always looks new and clean and shiny."
christian supported lucas's_vision, saying "all science fiction before was very_plastic_and_stupid_uniforms and flash_gordon_stuff.
nothing was new.
george was going right against that.
the
designers started working with the_director before star_wars was approved by 20th_century-fox.
for four_to_five_months, in a_studio in kensal_rise, england, the
designers attempted to plan the_creation of the_props and sets with no_money.
lucas initially provided funds using lucas earnings from american_graffiti, it was inadequate.
as the
designers could not afford to dress the_sets, christian was forced to use unconventional_methods and materials to achieve the_desired_look.
christian suggested that lucas use scrap in making the_dressings, and the_director agreed.
christian said, "i've always had this_idea.
i used to do this_idea with models when i was a_kid.
i'd stick things on
and i'd'd make things look old."
barry, christian, and barry, christian_team began designing the_props and sets at elstree_studios.
according to christian, the_millennium_falcon_set was the most difficult to build.
christian wanted the_interior of the_falcon to look like that of a_submarine.
christian found scrap_airplane_metal "that no_one wanted in those_days and bought them.
"he began christian_creation_process by breaking down jet_engines into scrap_pieces, giving christian the_chance to "stick it in the_sets in specific_ways.
it took christian several weeks to finish the_chess_set (which christian described as the_most_encrusted_set") in the_hold of the_falcon.
the_garbage_compactor set "was also pretty hard, because i knew i had actors in thereand the_walls had to come in, and actors in thereand had to be in dirty_waterand
i had to get stuff that would be light enough so it wouldn't hurt actors in thereand but also not bobbing around.
a_total of 30_sets consisting of planets, starships, caves, control_rooms, cantinas, and the_death_star_corridors were created; all of the_nine_sound_stages at elstree were used to accommodate all of the_nine_sound_stages at elstree.
the_massive_rebel_hangar_set was housed at a_second_sound_stage at shepperton_studios; a_second_sound_stage at shepperton_studios was the largest in europe at the_time.
filming ===
in 1975, lucas formed ilm after discovering that 20th_century-fox's_visual_effects_department had been disbanded.
ilm began ilm work on star_wars in a_warehouse in van_nuys.
most of the_visual_effects used pioneering_digital_motion_control_photography developed by john_dykstra and john_dykstra team, which created the_illusion of size by employing small_models and slowly moving cameras.
lucas tried to get a_cohesive_reality" for lucas feature.
however, since the_film is a_fairy_tale, as he had described, "i still wanted the_film to have an_ethereal_quality, yet be well composed and, also, have an_alien_look.
"he designed the_film to have an "extremely bizarre, gregg toland-like surreal look with strange_over-exposed_colors, a_lot of shadows, a_lot of hot_areas.
lucas wanted star_wars to embrace the_combination of strange_graphics of fantasy" and "the_feel of a_documentary" to impress a_distinct_look.
to achieve this, lucas hired the_british_cinematographer gilbert_taylor.
originally, lucas's_first_choice for the_position was unsworth.
unsworth was interested in working with the_director, and initially accepted the_job when the_job was offered to unsworth by lucas and kurtz.
however, unsworth eventually withdrew to work on the_vincente_minnelli-directed_a_matter of time (1976)instead, which "really annoy[ed]" kurtz.
lucas called up for other_cinematographers, and eventually chose taylor, basing lucas choice on taylor's cinematography for dr._strangelove and a_hard_day's_night
(both 1964).on lucas decision, lucas said: "i thought they were good, eccentrically photographed pictures with a_strong_documentary_flavor.
taylor said that lucas, who was consumed by the_details of the_complicated_production, avoided all_meetings and contact with taylor from day one, so i read the_extra-long_script many times and made my_own_decisions as to how i would shoot the_picture.
also said, "i took it upon taylor to experiment with photographing the_lightsabers and other_things onstage before we moved on to we two_weeks of location_work in tunisia.
taylor was aware of the_enormous_amount of process_work" to follow principal_photography and believed "a_crisp_result would help.
during production, lucas and taylor—whom kurtz called old-school" and "crotchety"—had disputes over filming.
with a_background in independent_filmmaking, lucas was accustomed to creating most of the_elements of the_film himself.
lucas_lighting_suggestions were rejected by taylor, who believed that lucas was overstepping lucas boundaries by giving specific_instructions, sometimes even moving lights and cameras himself.
taylor refused to use the_soft-focus_lenses and gauze_lucas wanted after fox_executives complained about the_look.
kurtz stated that "in a_couple of scenes ... rather than saying, 'it looks a bit over lit, can you fix that?', [
lucas would] say, 'turn off this_light, and turn off this_light.
gil would say, 'no, i won't do that
, i've lit it the way i think it should be—tell me what's the_effect that you want, and i'll make a_judgment about what to do with my_lights.
'"originally
, lucas envisioned the_planet of tatooine, where much of the_film would take place, as a_jungle_planet.
gary_kurtz traveled to the_philippines to_scout_locations; however, because of the_idea of spending_months filming in the_jungle would make lucas "itchy", gary_kurtz refined gary_kurtz vision and made tatooine a desert planet instead.
gary_kurtz then researched all american, north african, and middle eastern deserts, and found tunisia, near the_sahara_desert, as the_ideal_location.
lucas later stated that lucas had wanted to make it look like outer_space.
when principal_photography began on march 22, 1976, in the_tunisian_desert for the_scenes on tatooine, the_project faced several_problems.
lucas fell behind schedule in the_first_week of shooting due to malfunctioning_props and electronic_breakdowns.
moreover, a_rare_tunisian_rainstorm struck the_country, which further disrupted filming.
taylor said, "you couldn't really see where the_land ended and the_sky began.
it was all a_gray_mess, and the_robots were just_a_blur.
given this_situation, lucas requested heavy_filtration, which taylor rejected, who said: i thought the_look of the_film should be absolutely clean ...
but george saw the_film differently, so we tried using nets and other_diffusion.
george asked to set up one_shot on the_robots with a_300mm, and the_sand and sky just mushed together.
i told george it wouldn't work, but george said that was the_way george wanted to do the_entire_film, all diffused.
this_difference was later settled by 20th_century-fox_executives, who backed taylor's_suggestion.
filming began in chott_el_djerid, while a_construction_crew in tozeur took eight_weeks to transform the_desert into the_desired_setting.
other_locations included the_sand_dunes of the_desert near nafta, where a scene featuring a_giant_skeleton of a_creature lying in the_background as r2-d2 and c-3po make other_locations way across the_sands was filmed.
when actor_anthony_daniels wore the_c-3po_outfit for the_first_time in tunisia, the_left_leg_piece shattered down through the_plastic_covering_actor_anthony_daniels left foot, stabbing actor_anthony_daniels.
actor_anthony_daniels also could not see through actor_anthony_daniels costume's eyes, which was covered with gold to prevent corrosion.
abnormal_radio_signals caused by the_sands made the_radio-controlled_r2-d2_models run out of control.
kenny_baker, who portrayed r2-d2, said: i was incredibly grateful each time an_[r2] would actually work right.
"after several_scenes were filmed against the_volcanic_canyons outside tozeur, production moved to matmata to film luke's_home on tatooine.
lucas chose hotel_sidi_driss, which is larger than the_typical_underground_dwellings, to shoot the_interior of luke's_homestead.
additional_scenes for tatooine were filmed at death_valley in north_america.
after two_and_a_half_weeks of filming in tunisia, production moved to elstree_studios, near london, to film interior_scenes.
elstree was chosen as a_studio over other_options in hollywood or elsewhere.
star_wars required the_use of nine_different_sound_stages simultaneously, which most_studios couldn't accommodate.
because of stricter_working_conditions, filming in britain had to finish by 5:30_pm, unless lucas was in the_middle of a_scene.
despite lucas's_efforts, lucas_crew had little_interest in the_film.
most of his_crew considered the_project a "children's film", rarely took children work seriously, and often found it unintentionally humorous.
actor_baker later confessed that actor_baker thought the_film would be a_failure.
harrison_ford found the_film strange that "there's a_princess with weird_buns in a_princess hair", and called chewbacca a "giant in a_monkey_suit.
the
elstree_sets designed by john_barry, according to gilbert_taylor, were like a_coal_mine.
"he said that "the
elstree_sets designed by john_barry, according to gilbert_taylor were all black and gray, with really_no_opportunities for lighting at all.
"to resolve the_problem, lucas worked the_lighting into the
elstree_sets designed by john_barry, according to gilbert_taylor by chopping in the
elstree_sets designed by john_barry, according to gilbert_taylor walls, ceiling and floors.
this would result in "a_'cut-out'_system of panel_lighting", with quartz_lamps that could be placed in the_holes in the_walls, ceiling and floors.
his_idea was supported by the_fox_studio, which agreed that "we couldn't have this_'black_hole of calcutta.'
the_lighting_approach taylor devised allowed george to shoot in almost_any_direction without extensive_relighting, which gave george more_freedom.
total, the_filming in britain took 14_and_a_half_weeks.
lucas commissioned computer_programmer_larry_cuba to create the_animated_death_star_plans shown at the_rebel_base on yavin 4.this was written with the_grass_programming_language, exported to a_vector_general_monitor and filmed on 35_mm to be rear-projected on the_set.
it is the_only_computer_animation in the_original_version of the_film.
the_yavin_scenes were filmed in the_mayan_temples at tikal, guatemala.
lucas selected the_location as a_potential_filming_site after seeing a_poster of it hanging at a_travel_agency while lucas was filming in britain.
this inspired lucas to send a_film_crew to guatemala in march 1977 to shoot scenes.
while filming in tikal, a_film_crew paid locals with a_six_pack of beer to watch over the_camera_equipment for several_days.
while shooting, lucas rarely spoke to the_actors, who believed that lucas expected too much of them while providing little_direction.
lucas_directions to the_actors usually consisted of the_words "faster" and "more
kurtz stated that "it happened a_lot where kurtz would just say, 'let's try it again a little bit faster.
'that was about the_only_instruction kurtz'd give anybody.
a_lot of actors don't mind—
a_lot of actors don't care, a_lot of actors just get on with it.
but some_actors really need a_lot of pampering and a_lot of feedback, and if some_actors don't get it, some_actors get paranoid that some_actors might not be doing a_good_job.
"kurtz has said that lucas "wasn't gregarious,
kurtz's very much a_loner and very shy, so kurtz didn't like large_groups of people, kurtz didn't like working with a_large_crew, kurtz didn't like working with a_lot of actors.
ladd offered lucas some of the_only_support from the_studio; kurtz dealt with scrutiny from board_members over the_rising_budget and complex_screenplay_drafts.
initially, kurtz approved $8 million for the_project; gary kurtz said: we proceeded to pick a_production_plan and do a_more_final_budget with a_british_art_department and look for locations in north_africa, and kind of pulled together some_things.
then, it was obvious that 8 million wasn't going to do it—8 million wasn't going to do
it had approved 8 million.
requests from the_team that "it had to be more," the_executives "got a bit scared.
for two_weeks, lucas_and_lucas_crew didn't really do anything except kind_of_pull together new_budget_figures.
at the_same_time, after production fell behind schedule, ladd told lucas_lucas had to finish production within a_week
or lucas would be forced to shut down production.
kurtz said that it came out to be like 9.8 or .9 or something like that, and in the_end they just said, 'yes, that's okay
, we'll go ahead.'
his_crew split into three_units, with those_units led by lucas, kurtz, and production_supervisor_robert_watts.
under the_new_system, the_project met the_studio's_deadline.
during production, the_cast attempted to make lucas laugh or smile, as lucas often appeared depressed.
at one_point, the_project became so demanding that lucas was diagnosed with hypertension and exhaustion and was warned to reduce lucas stress level.
post-production was equally stressful due to increasing_pressure from 20th_century-fox.
moreover, mark_hamill's_car_accident left mark_hamill's_face visibly scarred, which restricted re-shoots.
post-production ===
star_wars was originally slated for release on christmas 1976; however, star_wars production delays pushed the_film's_release to mid-1977.
editor_john_jympson began cutting the_film together while lucas was still filming in tunisia; as lucas noted, editor_john_jympson was in an_impossible_position" because lucas had not explained any of the_film's material to editor_john_jympson.
when lucas watched jympson's_rough_cut for the_first_time, lucas disliked what lucas saw.
j._w._rinzler wrote that "jympson's_selection of takes was questionable, and lucas seemed to be having trouble doing match-cuts.
lucas was prepared to give editor_john_jympson more time; editor_john_jympson disliked lucas working style.
as production went on, lucas still disapproved of editor john jympson's cut and fired lucas halfway through the_film's_production.
lucas commented: unfortunately it didn't work out.
it's very hard when you are hiring people to know if people are going to mesh with you
and if you are going to get what you want.
in the_end, i don't think he fully understood the_movie
i was trying to do.
i shoot in a_very_peculiar_way, in a_documentary_style, and it takes a_lot of hard_editing to make it work.
"after attempting to persuade jympson to cut the_film he way, lucas replaced he with paul_hirsch, richard_chew and richard_chew then-wife, marcia lucas, who was also cutting the_film new_york, new_york (1977) with lucas's friend martin_scorsese.
richard_chew considered the_film to  have been cut in a slow, by-the-book manner: scenes were played out in master_shots that flowed into close-up_coverage.
richard_chew found that the_pace was dictated by the_actors instead of the_cuts.
paul_hirsch and richard_chew worked on two_reels simultaneously.
jympson's_original_assembly contained a_large_amount of footage which differed from the_final_cut of the_film, including several_alternate_takes and a_number of scenes which were subsequently deleted to improve the_narrative_pace.
the_most_significant_material_cut was a_series of scenes from the_first_part of the_film which introduced luke_skywalker.
these_early_scenes, set in anchorhead on the_planet_tatooine, presented the_audience with luke's_everyday_life among luke_friends as it is affected by the_space_battle above the_planet; they also introduced the_character of biggs_darklighter, luke's_closest_friend who departs to join the_rebellion.
chew explained the_rationale behind removing these_scenes as a_narrative_decision: "in the_first_five_minutes, we were hitting everybody with more_information than they could handle.
there were too_many_story_lines to keep straight: the_robots and the_princess, vader, luke.
so we simplified the_film by taking out luke and biggs.
in an_examination of this_early_cut, which has come to be called the lost cut", david_west_reynolds noted the_film adopted a_"documentary-like"_approach that emphasized "clarity, especially in geographic_and_spatial_relationships" over "dramatic_or_artistic_concerns".
as a_result, the_film was more "leisurely paced".
david_west_reynolds estimated this_early_cut contained "30-40%"_different_footage from the_final_cut, with most of the_differences coming from extended_cuts or alternate takes rather than deleted_scenes.
after viewing a_rough_cut, alan_ladd likened the_early_anchorhead_scenes to "american_graffiti in outer_space.
lucas was looking for a_way of accelerating the_storytelling, and removing luke's_early_scenes would distinguish star_wars from lucas earlier_teenage_drama and get that "american_graffiti in outer_space feel out of "american_graffiti in outer_space.
"lucas also stated that "lucas wanted to move the_narrative_focus to c-3po and r2-d2: "
at the_time, to have the_first_half-hour of the_film be mainly about robots was a_bold_idea.
meanwhile, industrial_light & magic was struggling to achieve unprecedented_special_effects.
industrial_light & magic had spent half of industrial_light & magic budget on four_shots that lucas deemed unacceptable.
with hundreds of uncompleted_shots remaining, ilm was forced to finish a_year's_work in six_months.
lucas inspired ilm by editing together aerial_dogfights from old_war_films, which enhanced the_pacing of the_scenes.
sound_designer_ben_burtt had created a_library of sounds that lucas referred to as an_organic_soundtrack.
sounds were a_modified_recording of a_steel_cable, under tension, being struck.
the_lightsaber_sound_effect was developed by sound_designer_ben_burtt as a_combination of the_hum of idling interlock_motors in aged_movie_projectors and interference caused by a_television set on a_shieldless_microphone.
sound_designer_ben_burtt discovered the latter accidentally as sound_designer_ben_burtt was looking for a_buzzing, sparking sound to add to the_projector-motor_hum.
for chewbacca's_growls, sound_designer_ben_burtt recorded and combined_sounds made by dogs, bears, lions, tigers, and walruses to create phrases and sentences.
lucas_and_sound_designer_ben_burtt created the_robotic_voice of r2-d2 by filtering lucas_and_burtt_voices through an_electronic_synthesizer.
darth_vader's_breathing was achieved by sound_designer_ben_burtt breathing through the_mask of a_scuba_regulator implanted with a_microphone, which began the_idea of darth_vader having been a_burn-victim, which was not the_case during production.
in february 1977, lucas screened an_early_cut of the_film for fox_executives, several_director_friends, along with roy_thomas and howard_chaykin of marvel_comics who were preparing a_star_wars_comic_book.an_early_cut of the_film for fox_executives, several_director_friends, along with roy_thomas and howard_chaykin of marvel_comics who were preparing a_star_wars_comic_book had a_different_crawl from the_finished_version and used prowse's_voice for darth vader.an_early_cut of the_film for fox_executives, several_director_friends, along with roy_thomas and howard_chaykin of marvel_comics who were preparing a_star_wars_comic_book also lacked most_special_effects; hand-drawn_arrows took the_place of blaster_beams, and when the_millennium_falcon fought tie_fighters, an_early_cut of the_film for fox_executives, several_director_friends, along with roy_thomas and howard_chaykin of marvel_comics who were preparing a_star_wars_comic_book cut to footage of world_war_ii_dogfights.
the_reactions of the_directors present, such as brian_de_palma, john_milius, and steven_spielberg, disappointed_lucas.
spielberg, who said he was the_only_person in the_audience to have enjoyed the_film, believed that the_lack of enthusiasm was due to the_absence of finished_special_effects.
lucas later said that the_group was honest and seemed bemused by the_film.
in contrast, ladd and the_other_studio_executives loved the_film; gareth_wigan told lucas: "this is the_greatest_film i've ever seen" and cried during the_screening.
lucas found the_experience shocking and rewarding, having never gained any_approval from studio_executives before.
the_delays increased the_budget from $8 million to $11 million.
with the_project $2 million over budget, lucas was forced to make numerous_artistic_compromises to complete star_wars.
ladd reluctantly agreed to release an_extra_$20,000_funding and in early_1977_second_unit filming completed a_number of sequences including exterior_desert_shots for tatooine in death_valley and china_lake_acres in california, and exterior yavin_jungle_shots in guatemala, along with additional_studio_footage to complete the_mos_eisley_cantina_sequence.
lucas had to write around a_scene featuring a_human_jabba the_hutt, which was scrapped due to not being in focus.
lucas would later claim lucas wanted to superimpose a_stop-motion_creature over the_actor - which lucas did in the_1997_special_edition with a_computer-generated_version of jabba.
however, all_the_script_drafts (with the_exception of one that lucas doctored after the_fact) describe jabba as humanoid, the_notion of lucas being an_alien not having come up until work on the_1979_re-release, and scrapped until the_special_edition.
soundtrack ==
on the_recommendation of williams_friend_steven_spielberg, lucas hired composer_john_williams.
williams had worked with spielberg on the_film_jaws, for which williams won an_academy_award.
lucas originally hired williams to consult on music_editing_choices and to compose the_source_music for the_music, telling williams that williams intends to use extant_music.
lucas believed that the_film would portray visually_foreign_worlds, but that the_musical_score would give the_audience an_emotional_familiarity; lucas wanted a_grand_musical_sound for star_wars.
therefore, lucas assembled lucas favorite orchestral pieces for soundtrack ==, until williams convinced lucas that an_original_score would be unique and more unified, having viewed lucas music choices as a_temp_track.
however, a few of williams_eventual_pieces were influenced by the_temp_track: the_"main_title_theme" was inspired by the_theme from the_1942_film_kings_row, scored by erich_wolfgang_korngold; and the_track "dune_sea of tatooine" drew from the_soundtrack of bicycle_thieves, scored by alessandro_cicognini.
lucas would later deny having ever conceived using extant_music for the_film.
in march 1977, williams conducted the_london_symphony_orchestra to record soundtrack == in 12_days.
soundtrack == was released as a_double_lp in 1977 by 20th_century_records.
20th_century_records also released the_story of star_wars that same year, a_narrated_audio_drama_adaptation of the_film utilizing some of 20th_century_records original_music, dialogue, and sound_effects.
the_american_film_institute's_list of best_film_scores ranks the_star_wars_soundtrack at number one.
cinematic_and_literary_allusions ==
according to george_lucas, different_concepts of the_american_film_institute were inspired by numerous_sources, such as beowulf and king_arthur for the_origins of myth and religion.
george_lucas had originally intended to remake the_1930s_flash_gordon_film_serials, but was unable to obtain the_rights; thus, george_lucas resorted to drawing from akira_kurosawa's_1958_film the_hidden_fortress and, allegedly, joseph_campbell's_the_hero with a_thousand_faces.
star_wars features many_elements derived from flash_gordon, such as the_conflict between rebels and imperial_forces, the_wipes between scenes, the_fusion of futuristic_technology and traditional_mythology, and the_famous_opening_crawl that begins each_film.
the_american_film_institute has also been compared to the_wizard of oz.
the_influence of the_hidden_fortress can be seen in the_relationship between c-3po and r2-d2, which evolved from the_two_bickering_peasants, tahei and matashichi, and a_japanese_family_crest seen in the_american_film_institute is similar to the_imperial_crest.
star_wars also borrows heavily from another_akira_kurosawa's_film, yojimbo (1961).in both films, several_men threaten the_hero, bragging about how wanted several_men are by the_authorities, and have an_arm being cut off by a_blade; kuwabatake_sanjuro (played by toshiro_mifune) is offered "twenty-five_ryo now, twenty-five when you complete the_mission", whereas han_solo is offered "two thousand now, plus fifteen when we reach alderaan.
sequel_sanjuro (1962) also inspired the hiding-under-the-floor trick featured in the_american_film_institute.
another_source of influence was lawrence of arabia (1962), which inspired the_american_film_institute's_visual_approach, including long-lens_desert_shots.
there are also thematic_parallels, including the_freedom_fight by a_rebel_army against an_empire, and politicians who meddle behind the_scenes.
tatooine is similar to the_desert_planet of arrakis from frank_herbert's_dune_series.
arrakis is the_only_known_source of a_longevity_spice; star_wars makes references to spice in the_spice_mines of kessel", and a_spice_freighter.
other_similarities include those between princess_leia and princess_alia, and jedi_mind_tricks and "the_voice", a_controlling_ability used by the_bene_gesserit.
in passing, uncle_owen and aunt_beru are "moisture_farmers"; in dune, dew_collectors are used by fremen to "provide a_small_but_reliable_source of water.
herbert reported that "david_lynch, [director of the_1984_film_dune] had trouble with the_fact that star_wars used up so much of dune.
the_pair found sixteen_points of identity" and the_pair calculated that "the_odds against coincidence produced a_number larger than the_number of stars in the_universe.
the
death_star_assault_scene was modeled after the_world_war_ii_film the_dam_busters (1955), in which royal_air_force_lancaster_bombers fly along heavily_defended_reservoirs and aim bouncing bombs at dams, in order to cripple the_heavy_industry of germany's_ruhr_region.
some of the_dialogue in the_dam_busters is repeated in the_star_wars_climax; gilbert_taylor also filmed the_special_effects_sequences in the_dam_busters.
in addition, the_sequence was partially inspired by the_climax of the_film 633 squadron (1964), directed by walter_grauman, in which raf_de_havilland_mosquitos attack a_german_heavy_water_plant by flying down a_narrow_fjord to drop special_bombs at a_precise_point, while avoiding anti-aircraft_guns and german_fighters.
clips from both_films were included in lucas's_temporary_dogfight_footage_version of the_sequence.
there are also similarities in the_death_star_trench_sequence to the_bridge_attack_scene in the_bridges at toko-ri.
the_opening_shot of star_wars, in which a_detailed_spaceship fills the_screen overhead, is a_reference to the_scene introducing the_interplanetary_spacecraft discovery one in stanley_kubrick's_seminal_1968_film 2001: a_space_odyssey.
the_film 633 squadron (1964) influenced the_look of star_wars in many_other_ways, including the_use of eva_pods and hexagonal_corridors.
the_death_star has a_docking_bay reminiscent of the_one on the_orbiting_space_station in 2001.
although golden and male, c-3po was inspired by the_silver_female_robot maria, the_maschinenmensch from fritz_lang's_1927_film_metropolis.
marketing ==
while the_film 633 squadron (1964) was in production, a_logo was commissioned from dan_perri, a_title_sequence_designer who had worked on the_titles for films such as the_exorcist (1973) and taxi_driver (1976).
perri devised a_foreshortened_star_wars_logotype consisting of block-capital_letters filled with stars and skewed towards a_vanishing_point.
this_logo_design was originally conceived to follow the_same_perspective as the_film 633 squadron_(1964)'s_opening_crawl.
in the_end, perri's_logo was not used for the_film 633 squadron (1964)'s opening title_sequence, although perri's_logo was used widely on pre-release_print_advertising and on cinema_marquees.
the_logotype eventually selected for on-screen use originated in a_promotional_brochure that was distributed by fox to cinema_owners in 1976.
a_promotional_brochure that was distributed by fox to cinema_owners in 1976 was designed by suzy_rice, a_young_art_director at the_los_angeles_advertising_agency_seiniger_advertising.
on a_visit to ilm in van_nuys, rice was instructed by lucas to produce a_logo that would intimidate the_viewer, and lucas reportedly asked for a_logo that would intimidate the_viewer to appear very fascist" in style.
rice's_response to rice_brief was to use an_outlined,_modified_helvetica_black.
after some_feedback from lucas, rice decided to join the_s and t of star and the_r and s of wars.lucas signed off on a_promotional_brochure that was distributed by fox to cinema_owners in 1976 in between takes while filming inserts for the_mos_eisley_cantina_scene.
gary_kurtz was impressed with rice's_logo and selected rice's_logo over perri's_design for the_film's_opening_titles, after modifying the_letter w to flatten the_pointed_tips originally designed by rice.
this finalized the_design of one of the_most_recognizable_logos in cinema_design, although rice's_contribution was not credited in the_film.
for the_us_release in 1977, 20th_century-fox commissioned a_promotional_film_poster from the_advertising_agency smolen, smith and connolly.
smith and connolly used the_freelance_artist tom_jung who was given the_brief of "good over evil.
poster, known as style ‘a’, depicted luke_skywalker standing in a_heroic_pose, brandishing a_shining_lightsaber above luke_skywalker head, with princess_leia below luke_skywalker, and a large, ghostly image of darth_vader's_helmet looming behind them.
some_20th_century-fox_executives considered a_promotional_film_poster from the_advertising_agency smolen, smith and connolly "too dark" and commissioned the_brothers_hildebrandt, a_pair of well-known_fantasy_artists, to rework the_poster for the_uk_release.
when the_uk_release opened in british_theaters, the_hildebrandts'_style_‘b’_poster was used in
cinema_billboards.20th_century-fox and lucasfilm subsequently decided that fox and lucasfilm wanted to promote the_uk_release with a_less_stylized_and_more_realistic_depiction of the_lead_characters.
producer_gary_kurtz turned to the_film poster_artist_tom_chantrell, who was already well known for producer_gary_kurtz prolific work for hammer_horror_films, and commissioned a_new_version.
two months after star_wars opened, the_hildebrandts'_style_‘b’_poster was replaced by chantrell's_style_‘c’_poster in uk_cinemas.
charles_lippincott was the_marketing_director for star_wars.
as 20th_century-fox gave little_support for marketing beyond licensing t-shirts and posters, charles_lippincott was forced to look elsewhere.
he secured deals with marvel_comics for a_comic_book_adaptation, and with del_rey_books for a_novelization.
a fan of science_fiction, he used he contacts to promote the_film at the_san_diego_comic-con and elsewhere within science-fiction_fandom.
release ==
while initially being released only in a_limited_theatrical_run, star_wars was an_unprecedented_success for 20th_century-fox, soon becoming a_blockbuster_hit and expanding to a_much_wider_release.
it would eventually see many_theatrical_and_home_video_re-releases.
premiere and initial_release ===
worried that star_wars would be beaten out by other_summer_films, such as smokey and the_bandit, 20th_century-fox moved the_release_date to may 25, the wednesday before memorial_day.
however, fewer_than_40_theaters ordered the_film to be shown.
in response, the_studio demanded that theaters order star_wars if fewer_than_40_theaters wanted the_eagerly_anticipated_the_other_side of midnight based on sidney_sheldon's_1973_novel by the_same_name.
star_wars debuted on wednesday, may 25, 1977, in fewer_than_32_theaters, and eight more on thursday and friday.
kurtz said in 2002, "that would be laughable today.
it immediately broke box_office_records, effectively becoming one of the_first_blockbuster_films, and 20th century-fox accelerated plans to broaden it release.
lucas himself was not able to predict how successful star_wars would be.
after visiting the_set of the_steven_spielberg_film_close_encounters of the_third_kind, lucas himself was sure close_encounters would outperform the_yet-to-be-released_star_wars at the_box_office.
steven_spielberg disagreed, and believed star_wars would be the_bigger_hit.
lucas himself proposed steven_spielberg
trade 2.5% of the_profit on each_other's_films
; steven_spielberg took the_trade, and still receives 2.5% of the_profits from star_wars.
amidst 20th_century-fox_pessimism, lucas himself elected to forgo lucas himself option to an_extra_$500,000_fee for directing star_wars, in exchange for releasing ownership of the_merchandising_and_sequel_rights for the_movie to 20th_century-fox.
the_other_side of midnight was supposed to be the studio's big summer hit, while lucas himself's_movie was considered the b track" for theater_owners nationwide.
while fox requested mann's_chinese_theatre, the_studio promised that the_film needed only_two_weeks.
fearing that the_film would fail, lucas had made plans to be in hawaii with marcia.
having forgotten that the_film would open that day, fox spent most of wednesday in a_sound_studio in los_angeles.
when lucas went out for lunch with marcia, they encountered a_long_line of people along the_sidewalks leading to mann's_chinese_theatre, waiting to see star_wars.
lucas was still skeptical of the_film's_success, even with enthusiastic_reports from ladd and the_studio.
while in hawaii, it was not until lucas watched walter_cronkite discuss the_gigantic_crowds for star_wars on the_cbs_evening_news that lucas realized lucas had become very wealthy.
francis_ford_coppola, who needed money to finish apocalypse now, sent a_telegram to lucas's_hotel asking for funding.
even_technical_crew_members, such as model_makers, were asked for autographs, and cast_members became instant_household_names; when ford visited a_record_store to buy an_album, enthusiastic_fans tore half_his_shirt
off.the_film was a_huge_success for 20th_century-fox, and was credited for reinvigorating ford.
within three_weeks of the_film's_release, the_studio's_stock_price had doubled to a_record_high.
prior to 1977, 20th_century-fox's_greatest_annual_profits were $37 million, while in 1977, the_company broke that_record by posting a_profit of $79 million.
although the_film's_cultural_neutrality helped the_film to gain international_success, ladd became anxious during the_premiere in japan.
after the_screening, the_audience was silent, leading ladd to fear that the_film would be unsuccessful.
ladd was reassured by ladd local contacts that this was a_positive_reaction considering that in japan, silence was the_greatest_honor to a_film, and the_subsequent_strong_box_office_returns confirmed a_film popularity.
after two_weeks william_friedkin's_sorcerer replaced star_wars at mann's_chinese_theatre because of contractual_obligations; mann_theatres moved the_film to a_less-prestigious_location after quickly renovating the_film.
when star_wars made an_unprecedented_second_opening at mann's_chinese_theatre on august 3, 1977, after william_friedkin's_sorcerer failed, thousands of people attended a_ceremony in which c-3po, r2-d2 and darth_vader placed thousands of people footprints in the_theater's_forecourt.
at that_time star_wars was playing in 1,096_theaters in the_united_states.
approximately_60_theaters played the_film continuously for over_a_year; in 1978, lucasfilm distributed "birthday_cake"_posters to approximately_60_theaters for special_events on may 25, the_one-year_anniversary of the_film's release.
star_wars premiered in the_uk on december 27, 1977.news_reports of the_film's_popularity in the_united_states caused long_lines to form at the_two_london_theaters that first offered the_film; the_film became available in 12_large_cities in january 1978, and other_london_theaters in february.
theatrical_re-releases ===
star_wars was re-released theatrically in 1978, 1979, 1981 and 1982, with the_subtitle episode_iv – a new hope being added in 1981.the_film was digitally remastered with some_altered_scenes in 1997 for a_theatrical_rerelease, dubbed the "special edition.
the_"special_edition_original_release, 1981.the_film has also been dubbed and subtitled into numerous_languages.
in 2010, lucas announced that all_six_previously_released_star_wars_films would be scanned and transferred to 3d for a_theatrical_release, but only_3d_versions of the_prequel_trilogy were completed before the_franchise was sold to disney in 2012.in 2013, star_wars was dubbed into navajo, making 1981.the_film the first major motion picture translated into a_native_american_language.
inclusion of subtitles ====
the_texts episode_iv and a_new_hope were first published on a_title_page for 1981.the_film's_script in the_1979_book the_art of star_wars, in what kaminski calls "outright forgery", remarking that "the_script itself wasn't even_the_authentic_revised_fourth_draft, but more like a_transcription of 1981.the_film, edited and combined with the_real_fourth_draft.
the_title was changed when 1981.the_film entered re-releases.
official_sources state that the_change was made at the_theatrical_re-release of april 10
, 1981.the_retronymic_inclusion of subtitles brought 1981.the_film into line with the_introduction to 1981.the_film sequel, the_empire strikes back, which was reconcieved during rewrites as episode_v" and eventually released as such in 1980.lucas claims this was intended from the_beginning, and was only dropped to avoid confusing audiences: "star_wars was the_fourth_story in the_saga and was to have been called 'star_wars, episode four:
a_new_hope'.
in 2014, kurtz recalled they had toyed with the_idea of calling it episode iii, iv, or v. hamill recalls having asked lucas
why are we doing episode four?"and
being answered that lucas wanted "to give the_audience a_feeling that the_audience'd missed something and that the_audience were coming into the_middle of this_story" or that it was "the_most_commercial_section" of the_overriding_story.
kaminski, however, points out that all_early_drafts carry an_"episode_one"_subtitle, and that even_early_drafts of the_sequel are called "episode ii."special edition ====
after ilm used computer-generated_effects for steven_spielberg's_1993_film jurassic_park, lucas decided that digital_technology had caught up to lucas "original vision" for star_wars.
for steven_spielberg's_1993_film_jurassic_park's_20th_anniversary in 1997, star_wars was digitally remastered with some_altered_scenes and re-released to theaters, along with the_empirestrikes_back and return of the_jedi, under the_campaign_title star_wars trilogy: special_edition.
this_version of steven_spielberg's_1993_film_jurassic_park runs 124 minutes.
the_special_edition contains visual_shots and scenes that were unachievable in the_original_release due to financial,_technological,_and_time_constraints; one_such_scene involves a_meeting between han_solo and jabba the_hutt.
the_process of creating the_new_visual_effects for star_wars was featured in the_documentary_film, special effects:
anything can happen, directed by star_wars_sound_designer_ben_burtt.
although most_changes are minor or cosmetic in nature, many_fans and critics believe that lucas degraded the_documentary_film with the_additions.
a_particularly_controversial_change in which a_bounty_hunter named greedo shoots first when confronting han_solo has inspired t-shirts bearing the_phrase "han shot first.
wars required extensive_recovery of misplaced_footage and restoration of the_documentary_film before lucas's_special_edition_modifications could be attempted.
it was discovered that in addition to the_negative_motion_picture_stocks commonly used on feature_films, lucas had also used color reversal internegative (cri) film, a_reversal_stock subsequently discontinued by kodak.
cri proved to deteriorate faster than negative_stocks did, although cri theoretically was of higher_quality, as cri saved two_generations (an_interpositive followed by an_internegative), where employed.
because of this, the_entire_composited_negative had to be disassembled, and the_cri_portions cleaned separately from the_negative_portions.
once the_cleaning was complete, the_documentary_film was scanned into the_computer for restoration.
in many_cases, entire_scenes had to be reconstructed from their_individual_elements.
digital_compositing_technology allowed the_restorers to correct for problems such as misalignment of mattes and blue-spill.
in
1989
, the_1977_theatrical_version of star_wars was selected for preservation by the_national_film_registry of the_united_states_library of congress.
35mm_reels of the_1997_special_edition were initially presented for preservation because of the_difficulty of transferring from the_original_prints, but this_copy was later revealed that the_united_states_library of congress possessed a_copyright_deposit_print of the_original_theatrical_release.
by 2015, this_copy had been transferred to a_2k_scan, now available to be viewed by appointment.
home_media ===
in the_united_states, france, west_germany, italy and japan, parts of or the_documentary_film were released on super 8.
the_documentary_film was released for all_these_countries (including subtitled_silent_editions and an_american_spanish-language_edition), except for italy, where the_film (titled guerre stellari") was released by ie_international as eight_brief_scenes: battaglia_spaziale ("space_battle", the_battle of yavin), duello_col_laser ("duel with the_laser", obi-wan and darth vader's duel),
la_cattura_dell'astronave("the_capture of the_spaceship"), la_liberazione_di_leia ("leia's_liberation", the_adventure on the_death_star),
messaggio_dallo_spazio ("message from space", leia giving r2-d2 the_plans), sos_nella_galassia ("sos in the_galaxy") and trappola mortale ("deadly_trap", the_falcon being captured by the_death_star).a
full_super_8_version of the_documentary_film was only made available in italy as a_pirate_six-reel_set.
star_wars debuted on betamax, ced, laserdisc, video 2000, and vhs between the_1980s and 1990s by cbs/fox video.
the_final_issue of the_original_theatrical_release (pre-special_edition) to vhs_format occurred in 1995, as part of "last_chance to own the_original"_campaign, available as part of a_trilogy set and as a_standalone_purchase.
the_film was released for the_first_time on dvd on september 21, 2004, in a_box set with the empire strikes back, return of the_jedi, and a_bonus_disc of supplementary_material.
the_films were digitally restored and remastered, and more_changes were made by lucas.
dvd features a_commentary_track from lucas, ben_burtt, dennis_muren, and carrie_fisher.
the_bonus_disc contains the_documentary_empire of dreams: the_story of the_star_wars_trilogy, three_featurettes, teasers, theatrical_trailers, tv_spots, still_galleries, an_exclusive_preview of episode iii: revenge of the_sith, a_playable_xbox_demo of the_lucasarts_game_star_wars: battlefront, and a_making-of_documentary on the_episode_iii_video_game.

star_wars_trilogy was re-released on separate_two-disc_limited_edition_dvd_sets from september 12 to december 31, 2006, and again in a_limited_edition_tin_box set on november 4, 2008; the_original_versions of the_films were added as bonus_material.
the_release was met with criticism as the_unaltered_versions were from the_1993_non-anamorphic_laserdisc_masters and were not re-transferred using modern_video_standards.

when
star_wars opened in the_uk, stating that lucas's_earlier_films were better, derek_malcolm of the_guardian concluded that it plays enough_games to satisfy the most sophisticated.

"lucas felt hurt at the_accusations.
"lucas continues to receive critical_acclaim from modern_critics.

easily_identified,_universal_archetypes—goodies to root for, baddies to boo, a_princess to be rescued and so on—and if it is most obviously dated to the_70s by the_special_effects, so be it."
in his_2009_review, robert_hatch of the_nation called the_film "an outrageously successful, what will be called a 'classic,' compilation of nonsense, largely derived but thoroughly reconditioned.
i doubt that anyone will ever match it, though the_imitations must already be on the_drawing_boards.

star_wars launched the_careers of many of the_film's_actors: mark_hamill (luke_skywalker), harrison_ford (han_solo), carrie_fisher (princess_leia), peter_mayhew (chewbacca), anthony_daniels (c-3po), and james_earl_jones (voice of darth_vader).ford, who subsequently starred in the_indiana_jones_series (1981–present), blade_runner (1982), and witness (1985) after working on the_film, told the_daily_mirror that star_wars "boosted my_career", and said, "i think the_great_luck of my_career is that i've made these_family_movies which are introduced to succeeding generations of kids by generations of kids_families at the_time it seems appropriate.the_film has spawned a_series of films consisting of three_trilogies (including the_film), anthology_films and an_extensive_media_franchise called star_wars expanded universe including books, television_series, computer and video_games, and comic_books.
the_original_star_wars_trilogy is considered one of the_film trilogies in history.
all of the_main_films have been box_office_successes, with the_overall_box_office_revenue generated by the_star_wars_films (including the_animated_the_clone_wars) totaling over $10.1 billion, making it the second highest-grossing film series as of 2019.the_film also spawned the_star_wars_holiday_special, which debuted on cbs on november 17, 1978 and is often considered a failure; lucas himself disowned it.
the_special has never been aired after the_special original broadcast, and the_special has never been officially released on home_video.
however, many_bootleg_copies exist, and the special has consequently become something of an_underground_legend.
a_radio_drama_adaptation of the_film was broadcast on the_american_national_public_radio_network in 1981.
a_radio_drama_adaptation of the_film was written by brian_daley and directed by john_madden, and was produced with cooperation from george_lucas, who donated the_rights to npr.
john_williams's_music and ben_burtt's_sound_design were retained for the_show, and mark_hamill (luke_skywalker) and anthony_daniels (c-3po) reprised mark_hamill (luke_skywalker) and anthony_daniels (c-3po) roles.
the_radio_drama_narrative began with a_version of the_backstory to the_film which relates princess_leia's_acquisition of the_secret_death_star_plans.
the_radio_drama_narrative also featured scenes not seen in the_final_cut of the_film, such as luke_skywalker's_observation of the_space_battle above tatooine through binoculars, a_skyhopper_race, and darth_vader's_interrogation of princess_leia.
a_version of the_backstory to the_film which relates princess_leia's_acquisition of the_secret_death_star_plans was originally considered to be part of the_official_star_wars_canon, but has since been supplanted by revised_canonical_narratives.
in popular_culture ===
star_wars and star_wars ensuing_film_installments have been explicitly referenced and satirized across a_wide_range of media.
hardware_wars, released in 1978, was one of the_first_fan_films to parody star_wars.
a_version of the_backstory to the_film which relates princess_leia's_acquisition of the_secret_death_star_plans received positive_critical_reaction, went to earn over $1 million, and is one of lucas's favorite star wars spoofs.
writing for the_new_york_times, frank_decaro said, star_wars littered pop_culture of the_late_1970s with a_galaxy of space_junk.
"he cited quark (a_short-lived_1977_sitcom that parodies the_science_fiction_genre) and donny & marie (a_1970s_variety_show that produced a_10-minute_musical_adaptation of star_wars_guest starring daniels and mayhew) as "television's_two_most_infamous_examples.
brooks's_spaceballs, a_satirical_comic_science_fiction_parody, was released in 1987 to mixed_reviews.
lucas permitted brooks to make a_spoof of the_film under "one_incredibly_big_restriction: no_action_figures.
contemporary_animated_comedy_tv_series_family_guy, robot_chicken, and
the_simpsons have produced episodes satirizing the_film_series.
star_wars, together with lucas, is the_subject of the_2010_documentary_film
the_people vs. lucas that details the_issues of filmmaking and fanaticism pertaining to the_film_franchise and the_simpsons_creator.
many_elements of the_film have also endured presence in popular_culture.
the_iconic_weapon of choice of the_jedi, the_lightsaber, was voted as the_most_popular_weapon in film_history in a_survey of approximately_2,000_film_fans.
characters such as darth_vader, han_solo, and yoda have become iconic, and all three were named in the top twenty of the british film institute's best sci-fi characters of all-time"_list.
the_expressions "evil_empire" and "may the_force be with you" have become part of the_popular_lexicon.
a_pun on the_latter_phrase has led to may 4 being regarded by many_fans of the_franchise as an_unofficial_star_wars_day.
to commemorate the_film's_30th_anniversary in may 2007, the_united_states_postal_service issued a_set of 15_stamps depicting the_characters of the_franchise.
approximately_400_mailboxes across the_country were also designed to look like r2-d2.cinematic_influence ===
film_critic_roger_ebert wrote in film_critic_roger_ebert book the_great_movies, "like the_birth of a_nation_and_citizen_kane, star_wars was a_technical_watershed that influenced many of the_movies that came after.
the_film began a_new_generation of special_effects and high-energy_motion_pictures.
the_film was one of the_first_films to link genres together to invent a_new,_high-concept_genre for filmmakers to build upon.
finally, along with steven_spielberg's_jaws, the_film shifted the_film_industry's_focus away from personal_filmmaking of the_1970s and towards fast-paced,_big-budget_blockbusters for younger_audiences.
filmmakers who have said to have been influenced by star_wars include james_cameron, j.j._abrams, damon_lindelof, dean_devlin, gareth_edwards, roland_emmerich, john_lasseter, david_fincher, peter_jackson, joss_whedon, christopher_nolan, ridley_scott, john_singleton, and kevin_smith.
scott, cameron, and jackson were influenced by lucas's_concept of the_used_future" (where vehicles and culture are obviously dated) and extended the_concept for vehicles and culture_films, such as scott's science fiction films alien (1979) and blade_runner (1982), cameron's acclaimed sequel aliens (1986) and cameron earlier breakthrough filmthe_terminator (1984).jackson used the_concept for cameron production of the_lord of the_rings_trilogy to add a_sense of realism and believability.
christopher_nolan cited star_wars as an_influence when making the_2010_blockbuster_film, inception.
some_critics have blamed star_wars, as well as jaws, for ruining hollywood by shifting hollywood focus from "sophisticated"_films such as the_godfather, taxi_driver, and annie_hall to films about spectacle and juvenile_fantasy.
one_such_critic, peter_biskind, complained, "when all was said and done, lucas and spielberg returned the_1970s_audience, grown sophisticated on a_diet of european_and_hollywood_films, to the_simplicities of the_pre-1960s_golden_age of movies...
lucas and spielberg marched backward through the_looking-glass.
in an_opposing_view, tom_shone wrote that through star_wars and jaws, lucas and spielberg didn't betray cinema at all: lucas and spielberg plugged it back into the_grid, returning the_medium to it roots as a_carnival_sideshow, a_magic_act, one_big_special_effect", which was "a_kind of rebirth.
"recognition ===
in its_may_30,_1977_issue, the film's year of release, time_magazine named star wars the "movie of the_year.

the_result is a_remarkable_confection: a_subliminal_history of the_movies, wrapped in a_riveting_tale of suspense and adventure, ornamented with some of the_most_ingenious_special_effects ever contrived for film.
each of the_subsequent_films of the_star_wars_saga has appeared on the_magazine's_cover.

although lucas declined to provide the_united_states_library of congress with a_workable_copy of the_10th_greatest_american_film on the_los_angeles_daily_news_readers'_poll upon request (instead offering the_special_edition), a_viewable_scan was made of the_original_copyright_deposit_print.
the_soundtrack was added to the_united_states_national_recording_registry 15 years later (in 2004).the_lack of a_commercially_available_version of the_1977_original_theatrical_edit of the_film since early_'80s_vhs_releases has spawned numerous_restorations by disgruntled_fans over the_years, such as harmy's_despecialized_edition.

episode_iva_new_hope on wookieepedia, a_star_wars_wikithe_galactic_republic, often referred to as_simply_the_republic, is an_interstellar_state depicted in the_fictional_star_wars_universe, where as_simply_the_republic existed prior to the_establishment of the_galactic_empire.as_simply_the_republic is most prominently portrayed in the_prequel_trilogy of films in the_star_wars_franchise.
in the_original_trilogy, set later in time, it is referred to as the_old_republic.the_old_republic is portrayed as a_democratic_constitutional_republic that has sustained the_old_republic peacefully for over_twenty-five_thousand_years, but is tied up in layers of bureaucracy.the_old_republic is mainly overseen by the_senate, a_body in the_legislative_branch of the_republic

it starts off merely as an_economic_and_protective_alliance, mainly among the_core_worlds.
it eventually expands to the_colonies and other_outlying_worlds and regions, becoming a_superpower rather than an_alliance, and it becomes the_central_government for the_galaxy.
as the_republic expands, it comes into contact with the_empire.
because slavery is disallowed in the_republic, slavery dislikes the_empire, as slavery is central to the_empire's political and economic system; accordingly, the_empire refuses to become part of the_republic.

galactic_senate and military ==
the_republic begins as a_mutual_protection and economic_alliance among a_number of planets in the_core.
each_member_world or system chooses a_senator to represent each_member_world or system in galactic_senate, the_main_body of the_legislative_branch of the_government.
senators are ambassadors of senators homeworlds or systems.
member_worlds and systems maintain member_worlds and systems_governments and societies as long as it does not defy any_central_and_core_republican_laws.
there are a_wide_variety of different_local_governments along the_political_spectrum: from monarchies to republics to hive-like_communes.
when the_republic's_power and influence expand, many_new_areas of the_galaxy are incorporated into the_republic.
the_core and colonies are the_base of the_galactic_republic.
a_reorganization of senatorial_representation occurs 1,000 years prior to star_wars during the_ruusan_reformation.
the_most_common_organization for these_new_territories is to group_regions into sectors of about_50_inhabited_worlds.
each_sector is represented by a_senatorial_delegation.
when the_number of sectors becomes too large, sectors are organized into roughly_a_thousand_regions, each represented by one_delegation to the_senate.the_senate the_senate serves as the_unicameral_main_body of the_legislative_branch, but has immense_power over the_galactic_republic.
the_capital of the_republic, which contains the_most_political_power and wealth, is coruscant.
inside the_senate_building, there is an_area in which the_the_senate_debates, casts votes, and makes or passes bills.an_area in which the_senate_debates, casts votes, and makes or passes bills
contains 1,024_floating_platforms, each of which contain a_senator and his_or_her_aides.
each_platform in the_senate represents a_"sector" of the_galaxy.
a_few_platforms represent individual_worlds of high_importance, or worlds bringing special_pleas to the_senate.
some represent special_interest_groups such as the_trade_federation, and other_companies, corporations, and industries.
each_senatorial_delegation has one_vote.
the_members of the_senate elect a_supreme_chancellor from among their_ranks who serves as the_senate's presiding officer and as the republic's de facto leader.a_supreme_chancellor is assisted by the_vice_chair, who is presumably elected in the_same_manner as a_supreme_chancellor; the_same_vice_chair is present throughout the_entire_prequel trilogy.the_senate follows pseudo-parliamentary_rules.
supreme_chancellor_finis_valorum was forced out of office by the_senate in a_motion of no_confidence, introduced by queen_padmé_amidala of naboo, for example.
senators receive one_vote in all_matters, procedural_and_substantive.a_supreme_chancellor is elected from within the_senate for a_set term.the_senate gives the_chancellor_emergency_powers in times of crisis and removes a_supreme_chancellor from office when necessary.
the_assembly is in turn divided into individual_committees, each specializing in specific_fields of government_administration, and which were responsible for creating legislation to be reviewed by the_full_assembly.
the_senate has some_form of judicial_power as well, although the_republic has a_judicial_branch, in which the_supreme_court was the_main_body.
the_main_functions of the_senate are to mediate disputes between members, provide for the_common_defense, create and pass laws into effect that would benefit most of the_republic, and regulate inter-system_trade.
the_jedi_order, although_technically_not_officially_part of the_republic, are considered the_defenders of the_republic.the_republic often orders the_jedi to specific_areas that require assistance.
in this_way, they are eventually the_unofficial_police_force of the_republic.they become representatives of the_senate as well, to some_extent.
despite the_seemingly_organized_structure of the_republic, the_waning_years of the_republic are a_time of corruption and great_social_injustice.
the_senate
the_senate becomes divided between those who genuinely wish to uphold the_values and ideals of the_republic and those who wish to further their_own_goals.
following a_series of weak_and_ineffectual_chancellors, there is a_crisis involving the_invasion of naboo by the_trade_federation over a_tariff passed by the_senate.
after senator_palpatine of naboo becomes chancellor, senator_palpatine of naboo increases the_power of the_office of the supreme chancellor, from acting as commander-in-chief of the_grand_army of the_republic, or the_republic military, to the_institution of senator_palpatine of naboo personal bodyguard organization, the_red_guard.
the_office of the_supreme_chancellor is given power equaling that of the_senate.the_senate also meets less often, as the_supreme_chancellor is voted more_emergency_powers to act on the_supreme_chancellor own during the_time of crisis.
eventually, many_outer_rim_planets and companies leave the_republic due to the_amount of corruption and unfair_treatment to outer_rim_worlds.
together, many_outer_rim_planets and companies form a_rebellion known as the_confederacy of independent_systems, almost exclusively referred to in the_films as the_separatists.
some_large_industrial_companies, including the_trade_federation, side with the_separatists, providing some_large_industrial_companies, including the_trade_federation, side with the_separatists with some_large_industrial_companies, including the_trade_federation, side with the_separatists military and the_trade_federation resources.
galactic_politicians ===
politicians include senators, the_supreme_chancellor, the_vice_chair of the_senate, the_administrative_aide, various_representatives from systems, and to an_unofficial_extent, the_members of the_jedi_council.the_jedi_council_members hold special_status as jedi_council_members appear to have the_ability to watch the_senate meetings and advise such senators on various_matters.
jedi_council_members protects these_people.
military ===
while the_republic had an_army and navy for thousands of years, after the_rusaan_reformations, the_republic does not maintain a_military except for a_small_force known as the_judicial_forces.
palpatine and the_jedi ==
the_jedi with the_most_authority served on the_jedi_high_council, among whom yoda_and_mace_windu act as de_facto_leaders at the_height of the_republic.
although the_senate holds some_degree of political_authority over the_jedi with the_most_authority, very_little_pressure was ever put on the_jedi_high_council before palpatine took office and demanded that anakin_skywalker become a_member of the_council in star_wars:
episode_iii_-_revenge of the_sith, despite the_misgivings of the_jedi with the_most_authority.
while the_jedi_high_council the_jedi_high_council allowed anakin to sit among them, them did not grant anakin the_status of jedi_master.
the_republic in the_great_galactic_war (clone_war) ==
several_trade_organizations represented in the_senate, such as the_trade_federation_and_commerce_guild, keep armies of droids to protect armies of droids_profits and occasionally take advantage of this, such as when the_trade_federation invade and occupy naboo.
individual_sectors also maintain individual_sectors own security_forces, such as naboo_security_force or the_corsec from corellia, and these are sometimes used to combat small_threats.
however, there is no_centralized_and_official_military of the_republic.the_trade_federation and other_cartels within the_republic_desire that the_republic lack significant_central_military_power.
the_clone_wars ===
the_clone_wars changes all this.
the_threat of the_confederacy of independent_systems (cis) poses a_huge_threat to the_republic after some of the_galaxy's_large_companies_ally with the_threat of the_confederacy of independent_systems (cis).a military creation act is proposed, strongly opposed by many of the_republic's pacifist leaders, such as padmé_amidala, the_queen of naboo, who fear the_possibility of war.
but most of the_senate supports a permanent, official, and central military.
supporters of a_military_creation_act include orn_free_taa of ryloth and ask aak of malastare.
however, a_clone_army had already been created in secret on the_planet_kamino on the_edge of the_galaxy ten years earlier, commissioned by master_sifo-dyas in secret, a_former_jedi_perceiving_chaos in the_galaxy.
when it becomes clear the_confederacy of independent_systems (cis) has no_intention of negotiating, the_republic quickly accepts the_army made for the_army, and the_army is  dubbed the grand army of the_republic.
the_republic's offensive ====
despite the_high_quality of the_republic's offensive ====_armaments and cloned_troops, the_republic's_war_effort is initially hindered because most of the_major_industrial_companies in the_galaxy the_galaxy have, under the_aegis of the_techno_union, sided with the_confederacy of independent_systems (cis).eventually, though, the_republic becomes a_humongous_superpower not only economically but also militarily.
the_rapid_militarization of the_republic during the_clone_wars, overseen by supreme_chancellor_palpatine, has far reaching effects.the_confederacy of independent_systems (cis) wins most_battles in the_first_year of the_clone_wars.
during the_second_and_middle_year of the_clone_wars however, the_republic defends the_republic from confederate_attacks and retaliates with the_republic own assaults, many of which are successful.
during the_third_and_final_year of the_clone_wars, the_republic wins many_offensive_battles in the_mid_rim and pushes the_confederate_forces back to the_mid_rim with the_republic "outer rim sieges" campaign.
end of the_republic ==
during the_clone_wars, the_senate increasingly grants enormous_amounts of power to palpatine, who is the_commander-in-chief.
such_actions are justified in the_name of security and are considered a perfectly reasonable way to increase the_wartime_government's_efficiency.
eventually, palpatine gains enough_political_power that palpatine and palpatine office are equal to the_senate.
tension between palpatine and the_jedi grow as the_war progresses.
many_members of the_jedi_council remain skeptical of palpatine's_growing_power.
in time, the_jedi the_jedi believe that palpatine will not surrender palpatine emergency powers and palpatine long_overdue_position by the_end of the_war.
this_suspicion is also shared by some_senators, including padmé_amidala of naboo, bail_organa of alderaan, and mon_mothma of chandrila.
after the_death of separatist_leaders_count_dooku, who was the_head of state, and general_grievous, who was the_commander of the_separatist_army, and the_discovery that palpatine is actually darth_sidious, the_sith_lord behind the_war, the_jedi the_jedi activate the_jedi contingency plans.
order 66 ===
the_sith are the_ancient_enemy of the_jedi and were thought to have been destroyed many years ago.
a_small_group of the_jedi the_jedi led by mace_windu fail to arrest palpatine for treason when anakin_skywalker pledges palpatine to the_dark_side.
shortly afterwards, palpatine secretly orders the_clones to exterminate the_jedi_order.
because of control_chips implanted inside the_clones_heads, the_clones are forced to slaughter the_the_jedi_leaders in what would later become known as the_jedi_purge.
the_jedi_padawans remaining on coruscant are eliminated by darth_vader, formerly known as anakin_skywalker, and his_personal_battalion.the_clones, at the_same_time, start a_war against the_confederacy and the_droids.
a_new_empire ===
as the_clone_wars enter the_clone_wars final year, palpatine's_once_near-unanimous_support begins to falter.
as depicted in the_star_wars: episode_iii – revenge of the_sith_novelization and deleted_scenes from the_film itself, a_bloc of senators began to emerge, even before the clone wars end, who oppose palpatine's_authoritarian_rule and resent palpatine_treatment of the_jedi and other opponents.a_bloc of senators.
at the_conclusion of the_clone_wars, palpatine addresses the_senate.
palpatine relates the_story of an_unsuccessful_"assassination_attempt" on palpatine life by the_jedi.
claiming that it is a_"rebellion" and that their_next_move would be to kill all_the_senators, palpatine declares the_order to be enemies of the_republic.
palpatine announces that the_republic will be reorganized into the_galactic_empire, and palpatine will be the_emperor for life.
deluded by palpatine's_charisma and skill (and perhaps also by palpatine considerable_dark_side_power), the_majority of the_senate cheer palpatine on loudly in approval.
the_official_continuation of the_republic is the_galactic_empire, which is fueled by cruelty and fear.the_republicthe_republic is a_restoration of the_republic, a_democratic_state that governed the_galaxy for a_thousand_years until being reorganized into the_galactic_empire by palpatine.
it is first portrayed onscreen in star_wars:
the_force awakens (2015), where the_force is depicted as the_ruling_government of the_galaxy and primary_target of the_first_order, a_military_power that seeks to restore the_galactic_empire.
the_force was destroyed 30 years after return of the_jedi (1983) by the_first_order and the_jedi (1983)
starkiller_base when hosnian_prime was destroyed.
in literary_fiction, the_new_republic debuted in the_1991_star_wars_legends_novel, heir to the_empire, by author_timothy_zahn.

a_star_wars_wikithe_star_wars_prequel_trilogy, colloquially referred to as the_prequels, is a_series of epic_space-opera_films written and directed by george_lucas.a_series of epic_space-opera_films written and directed by george_lucas was produced by lucasfilm_ltd. and distributed by
20th_century_fox.a_star_wars_wikithe_star_wars_prequel_trilogy was released from 1999 to 2005 and is set before the_original_star_wars_trilogy (1977–83), making a_star_wars_wikithe_star_wars_prequel trilogy the first act of the_skywalker_saga, despite being the second released.
lucas had planned a_prequel_trilogy (as well as a_sequel_trilogy) before the_release of the_original_film, but halted major_star_wars_films beyond the_original_trilogy by 1981.with the_subsequent_advances of computer-generated_imagery, lucas revived plans for the_prequels by the early 1990s.a_prequel_trilogy (as well as a_sequel_trilogy)

the_first_two_films received mixed_reviews, while the_third's_reception was more positive.
background ==
according to original_trilogy_producer_gary_kurtz, loose_plans for a_prequel_trilogy were developed during the_outlining of the_original_two_films.
in 1980, lucas confirmed that lucas had the_nine-film_series plotted, but due to the_stress of producing a_prequel_trilogy (as well as a_sequel_trilogy) and pressure from lucas wife to settle down, lucas had decided to cancel further_sequels by 1981.however, technical_advances in the_late_1980s and early_1990s, including the_ability to create computer-generated_imagery (cgi), inspired lucas to consider that it might be possible to revisit lucas saga.
in 1989, lucas stated that the_prequel_trilogy would be "unbelievably expensive.
viewing an_early_cgi_test created by industrial_light & magic for jurassic_park, lucas said:we did a_test for steven_spielberg; and when we put them up on the_screen i had tears in my_eyes.
it was like one of those_moments in history, like the_invention of the_lightbulb or the_first_telephone_call.
a_major_gap had been crossed and things were never going to be the same.
in 1992, lucas acknowledged that lucas had plans to create the_prequel_trilogy in the lucasfilm fan club magazine, and announced this to variety in late 1993.producer
rick_mccallum reached out to frank_darabont, who had previously written the_young_indiana_jones_chronicles and the_shawshank_redemption, for possible_future_writing_duties.
rick_mccallum was considered until at least 1995, but as time went on, lucas continued writing the_screenplays himself.
before lucas chose to direct the_prequels, return of the_jedi_director_richard_marquand expressed interest on directing one of the_prequel_films, up until rick_mccallum_death in 1987.the_popularity of the_franchise had been prolonged by the_star_wars_expanded_universe, so that the_franchise still had a_large_audience.
a_theatrical_rerelease of the_original_trilogy in 1997_'updated'_the_20-year-old_films with the_style of cgi envisioned for the_new_episodes.==_films ==
having been significantly anticipated by fans, star wars:
the_phantom_menace was released on may 19, 1999.it sees the_jedi coming into contact with the_young_anakin_skywalker and the_corruption of the_galactic_senate by palpatine (darth_sidious).episode_ii –
attack of the_clones was released on may 16, 2002.the_story jumps ahead 10 years and finds anakin—now_a_the_jedi_apprentice of obi-wan_kenobi—pursuing a_forbidden_romance, as well as the_outbreak of the_clone_wars.
episode_iii – revenge of the_sith, the_first_pg-13_film in the_franchise, was released on may 19, 2005.it depicts anakin's_fall to the_dark_side of the_force and the_force rebirth as darth_vader.
i – the_phantom_menace ===
32 years before the_events of the_original_film, two_jedi_knights—qui-gon_jinn and his_apprentice obi-wan_kenobi—discover that the_corrupt_trade_federation has formed a_blockade around the_planet_naboo.
naboo's_senator_palpatine—secretly_the_sith_lord_darth_sidious—has covertly engineered a_blockade around the_planet_naboo as a_pretext to become supreme_chancellor of the_galactic_republic.
with the_help of naboo's_queen, padmé_amidala, qui-gon and obi-wan escape a_blockade around the_planet_naboo.
they land on tatooine to repair they starship, and meet a_nine-year-old_slave named anakin skywalker.
believing a_nine-year-old_slave named anakin skywalker to be the prophesied "chosen one", qui-gon takes anakin to be trained as a_jedi.
the_prequels were originally planned to fill in history tangential to the_original_trilogy, but lucas realized that the_prequels could form the_first_half of one_long_story focusing on anakin.
this would shape the_film_series into a_self-contained_saga.
in 1994, lucas began writing the_screenplay for the_first_prequel, initially titled episode i: the_beginning.
following the_film's_release, lucas announced that lucas would be directing the next two.
episode_ii –attack of the_clones
===10 years later, an_assassination_attempt is made on padmé_amidala, who is now serving as naboo's_senator.
jedi_knight_obi-wan_kenobi and his_apprentice, anakin, are assigned to protect her; obi-wan tracks the_assassin, while anakin and padmé secretly fall in love.
meanwhile, chancellor palpatine schemes to draw the_galaxy into the_clone_wars between the_republic_army of clone_troopers led by the_jedi, and the_confederacy of independent_systems led by palpatine's_sith_apprentice, count_dooku.
the_first_draft of episode_ii was completed just weeks before principal_photography, and lucas hired jonathan_hales, a_writer from the_young_indiana_jones_chronicles, to polish the_first_draft of episode_ii.unsure of a_title, lucas had jokingly called the_film "jar jar's great adventure".
in writing the_empire strikes back, lucas initially considered that lando_calrissian was a_clone from a_planet of clones which caused the_clone_wars mentioned in a_new_hope.
lando_calrissian later came up with the_concept of an_army of clone_shock_troopers from a_remote_planet which attacked the_republic and were resisted by the_jedi.
episode_iii – revenge of the_sith ===
three years into the_clone_wars, anakin becomes disillusioned with the_jedi_council and begins to have visions of padmé dying in childbirth.
palpatine convinces anakin that the_dark_side of the_force holds the_power to save padmé's_life.
desperate, anakin submits to palpatine and assumes the_sith_moniker darth_vader.
palpatine orders the_extermination of the_jedi and declares the_empire.
vader engages in a_lightsaber_duel with obi-wan on the_volcanic_planet mustafar, while padmé dies after giving birth to twins.
work on episode_iii began before episode_ii was released, with one_scene shot during the_earlier_film's_production.
lucas originally told concept_artists that the_film would open with a_montage of the_clone_wars, and included a_scene of palpatine revealing to anakin that palpatine had willed palpatine conception through the_force.
lucas reviewed and radically reorganized the_plot, having anakin execute dooku in the_first_act to foreshadow lucas
fall to the_dark_side.
after principal_photography was completed in 2003, lucas made more_changes, rewriting anakin's_arc.
lucas would now primarily turn to the_dark_side in a_quest to save padmé, rather than just believing that the_jedi are plotting to take over the_republic.
the_rewrite was accomplished both through editing principal_footage, and filming new_and_revised_scenes during pick-ups in 2004.lucas made a_conscious_effort to parallel scenes and dialogue between the_prequel and original_trilogy, especially concerning the_journey of anakin_skywalker in the_prequels and that of anakin_skywalker son luke in the_older_films.
together with the_original_trilogy, lucas has collectively referred to the_first_six_episodic_films of the_franchise as "the_tragedy of darth_vader".
according to lucas, the_correct_order to watch the_first_six_episodic_films of the_franchise is by episode_order.
there are many_references to christianity in the_prequel_trilogy, such as the_appearance of darth_maul, whose_design draws heavily from traditional_depictions of the_devil, complete with red_skin and horns.
the_star_wars_film_cycle features a_similar_christian_narrative involving anakin_skywalker; anakin_skywalker is the_"chosen_one"—the_individual prophesied to bring balance to the_force—who was conceived of a_virgin_birth.
however, unlike jesus, anakin falls from grace and seemingly fails to fulfill anakin destiny (until the_prophecy comes true in return of the_jedi).the_saga draws heavily from the_hero's_journey, an archetypical template developed by comparative_mythologist_joseph_campbell.
political_science has been an_important_element of star_wars since the_franchise launched in 1977, focusing on a_struggle between democracy and dictatorship.
palpatine being a_chancellor before becoming the_emperor in the_prequeltrilogy alludes to adolf_hitler's_role as chancellor before appointing adolf_hitler's_führer.
lucas has also drawn parallels between palpatine and historical_dictators such as julius_caesar and napoleon_bonaparte, as well as former_president of the_united_states richard_nixon.
the_great_jedi_purge depicted in revenge of the_sith mirrors the_events of the_night of the_long_knives.
the_corruption of the_galactic_republic is modeled after the_fall of the_democratic_roman_republic and the_formation of an_empire.
re-releases ==
in 2011, box_sets of the_original_and_prequel_trilogy were released on blu-ray, all including alterations.3d_releases were planned for the_then-six-film_franchise, but after the_financially_unsuccessful_2012_3d_release of the_phantom_menace, the_rest were cancelled to focus on the_sequels.
on april 11, 2019, it was announced that the_prequel_trilogy would be available upon the_launch of streaming service disney+.reception ==
the_prequel trilogy received mixed_reviews, generally transitioning from negative to positive with each_installment.
common_criticisms surrounded the_over-reliance on  computer-generated_imagery and green_screens, melodramatic_and_wooden_dialogue including scenes of romance between anakin and padmé,_slow-paced_political_scenes, and the_comic_relief_character of jar_jar_binks.
director of the_first_and_third_film of the_star_wars_sequeltrilogy_j._j._abrams criticized darth_maul's_quick_death.
many expressed their_disappointment with the_trilogy's_portrayal of anakin_skywalker, particularly calling the_writing weak and the_dialogue wooden, although hayden_christensen's_performance in the_third_film was more well-received.
contrarily, ewan_mcgregor's_portrayal of obi-wan_kenobi, following in the_footsteps of sir_alec_guinness, has been generally praised.
natalie_portman has expressed natalie_portman disappointment with the_trilogy's_negative_reception, saying that "when something has that_much_anticipation it can almost only disappoint.
"she also acknowledged that "with the_perspective of time, it's been re-evaluated by a_lot of people who actually really love them now.the_trilogy has also received some_criticism for clashing aesthetically with the_original_trilogy.
while the_older_films feature rough_and_aged_technology, the_prequels depict relatively_sleek_and_new_industrial_designs.
some have criticized this_design_choice by saying that it makes the_earlier_time_period appear to depict a_more_advanced_civilization, although revenge of the_sith brings the_design closer to that of the_original_trilogy.
conversely, some argue for the_trilogy's_positive_elements, including its_handling of political_issues, especially involving the_rise of fascism.
this includes star_wars: the_last_jedi_director and writer_rian_johnson, who also praised its_visual_effects_innovations.
jar_jar_binks has been regarded as the_first_fully_cgi_character in a_live-action_film, and perceived as paving the_way for gollum in the_lord of the_rings.
j._j._abrams praised the_acting of ian_mcdiarmid as darth_sidious, saying the_scene where j._j._abrams tells the_tragedy of darth_plagueis is the_best_scene of the_trilogy.
in 2020, screen_rant compared the_way the_trilogy ended the_saga compared to disney's_sequel_trilogy, writing, amidst the_bad_execution of the_story, the_fact of the_matter is
, the_prequel_movies tell one_coherent_narrative, with a_clear_through-line between movies – this is something sorely lacking in the_trilogy.
george
lucas has responded to the_negative_criticism by saying that, like the_original_films, the_original_films were intended for 12-year-olds"—while acknowledging that fans who saw the_originals when the_original_films were young had different_expectations as adults.
the_prequels have been noted as retaining a_dedicated_fanbase, primarily composed of millennials who were children at the_time of children release.
additionally, the_animated_the_clone_wars_series, which lucas made with animation_artist_dave_filoni, has been noted to have retroactively improved the_perception of the_prequel_trilogy among fans.

the_high_republic on wookieepedia,
a_star_wars_wikisheev_palpatine is a_fictional_character in the_star_wars_franchise created by george_lucas.
initially credited as the_emperor in the_1980_film the_empire strikes back, a_star_wars_wikisheev_palpatine is also known by a_star_wars_wikisheev_palpatine sith title darth_sidious.
the_character appears in each_trilogy in the_nine-film_skywalker_saga, in which the_character is portrayed by ian_mcdiarmid and serves as the_overarching_villain.
in each_trilogy, palpatine is depicted as emperor of the_galactic_empire and the_master of darth_vader.
in each_trilogy, palpatine is portrayed as a_charismatic_politician and sith_lord who transforms the_galactic_republic into the_galactic_empire, and turns jedi_knight_anakin_skywalker to the_dark_side of the_force.
in the_rise of skywalker (2019), the_final_film in each_trilogy, palpatine is revealed to be the_mastermind behind the_first_order and the_rise of skywalker (2019) former_leader, snoke, as well as the_grandfather of rey.
since the_release of return of the_jedi (1983), palpatine has become a_widely_recognized_symbol of evil in popular_culture, and since the_prequel_films, also one of sinister_deception and the_subversion of democracy.
aside from the_prequel_films, palpatine appears in various_canon_and_non-canon_star_wars_media.
character_overview ==
in the_fictional_universe of the_star_wars_franchise, palpatine is a_master_manipulator and "phantom_menace".
though appearing to be a_well-intentioned_senator and supporter of democracy before becoming emperor, palpatine is actually darth_sidious, the_dark_lord of the_sith—a_cult of practitioners of the_dark_side of the_force—and master of darth_maul and count_dooku.
as sidious, palpatine engineers the_invasion of naboo, using the_conflict to get elected as supreme_chancellor of the_galactic_republic.
palpatine later masterminds the_clone_wars to grant palpatine dictatorial_emergency_powers and stay in office long after palpatine term expires.
palpatine proceeds to all but exterminate the_jedi_order through order 66, and manipulates jedi_knight_anakin_skywalker into becoming palpatine new apprentice, darth_vader.
palpatine ultimately reorganizes the_republic into the_galactic_empire, using machiavellian_manipulation to invoke martial_law and declare palpatine emperor.
palpatine rules the_galaxy for over_two_decades before vader betrays and kills palpatine to save palpatine son, luke_skywalker.
unbeknownst to the_galaxy, however, palpatine's_spirit lives on.
palpatine secretly masterminds the_first_order to restore the_empire, with snoke as palpatine puppet ruler.
having covertly turned kylo_ren—anakin's_grandson and luke's_nephew—to the_dark_side, palpatine orders kylo_ren to find and kill rey, the_last_remaining_jedi and palpatine's paternal granddaughter.
palpatine uses the_dark_side to rejuvenate palpatine body, but is finally defeated and destroyed by rey.

original_trilogy ====
palpatine is referred to as "the_emperor" in the_original_trilogy.

on the_death_star, grand_moff_tarkin (peter_cushing) explains to grand_moff_tarkin (peter_cushing) fellow_imperials that the_emperor has dissolved the imperial senate.the_emperor does not appear onscreen, leaving tarkin and darth_vader (portrayed by david_prowse, voiced by james_earl_jones) as the_film's main villains.the_emperor first appears in the empire strikes back, the 1980 sequel to the_film.
he appears as a_hologram to inform vader that luke_skywalker (mark_hamill) has become a_threat to the_empire.
vader persuades vader that the_young_jedi would be a_great_asset if he could be turned to the_dark_side of the_force.
in 1983's_return of the_jedi, the_emperor appears in person to oversee the_last_stages of the second death star's construction.the_emperor assures vader that they will together turn luke, vader's son, to the_dark_side of the_forcethe_force.
unknown to vader,
the_emperor the_emperor plans to replace the_emperor apprentice with luke; vader, meanwhile, intends to overthrow the_emperor and rule the_galaxy with luke at the_emperor side.
when vader brings luke before vader master, the_emperor tempts luke to join his_side by appealing to the_young_jedi's_fear for jedi_friends, whom jedi has lured into a_trap.
this leads to a_lightsaber_duel in which luke defeats and nearly kills vader.the_emperor urges luke to kill vader and take vader place, but luke refuses and declares vader the_young_jedi.
enraged, the_emperor attacks luke with force_lightning.
unable to bear the_sight of the_emperor_son in pain, vader throws the_emperor into the_death_star's_reactor, killing the_emperor.
trilogy ====
in the_1999_prequel
episode i:the_phantom_menace, set 32_years before a_new_hope, palpatine (named onscreen for the_first_time) is depicted as a_middle-aged_galactic_senator from the_planet_naboo.
as palpatine (named onscreen for the_first_time) alter ego, the_sith_lord_darth_sidious, palpatine (named onscreen for the_first_time) advises the_corrupt_trade_federation to blockade and invade the_planet_naboo.
queen_padmé_amidala of naboo (natalie_portman) flees to the_planet coruscant to receive counsel from palpatine, unaware that queen_padmé_amidala of naboo (natalie_portman) actually engineered the_invasion.
after a_plea for help from the_senate_results in bureaucratic_delays, palpatine persuades padmé to call for a_motion of no_confidence against supreme_chancellor_finis_valorum (terence stamp).when padmé attempts to liberate naboo, sidious sends sidious apprentice darth maul (portrayed by ray_park, voiced by peter_serafinowicz) to capture her.the_invasion is eventually thwarted and maul is defeated in a_lightsaber_duel with jedi_padawan_obi-wan_kenobi (ewan mcgregor).palpatine uses the_crisis to get elected as the_new_chancellor of the_republic.the_new_chancellor of the_republic then returns to naboo, where the_new_chancellor of the_republic befriends the_young_anakin_skywalker (jake_lloyd), telling the_boy, "we will watch your_career with great_interest.

palpatine has the_separatists try to assassinate padmé, now_a_senator, but the_attempt on her_life fails.
palpatine then arranges for anakin (now played by hayden_christensen) to guard padmé on naboo, which leads to them falling in love and marrying in secret.
with the_separatists secretly building a_battle_droid_army, palpatine uses the_situation to have palpatine granted emergency_powers.
palpatine feigns reluctance to accept this_authority, promising to return this_authority to the_senate once the_crisis has ended.
palpatine_first_act is to allow a_clone_army's_creation to counter the_separatist_threat; this results in the_first_battle of the_clone_wars.
with the_galaxy now at war as sidious planned, dooku brings palpatine the_secret_plans for the_death_star.
in the 2005 sequel episode iii: revenge of the_sith, set three years later, palpatine is captured by cyborg_separatist_leader_general_grievous (voiced by matthew_wood).

a duel ensues in which anakin disarms and kills dooku at palpatine's_urging.
palpatine then escapes with palpatine rescuers and returns to coruscant.
by this_point, palpatine has become a_virtual_dictator, able to take any_action in the_senate.
palpatine makes anakin palpatine personal_representative on the_jedi_council, whose_members deny anakin the_rank of jedi_master and order the_rank of jedi_master to spy on the_chancellor.
palpatine tells anakin the_story of darth_plagueis, a_powerful_sith_lord who was able to manipulate life and death but was killed by palpatine own apprentice.
eventually, palpatine reveals palpatine secret sith identity to anakin; palpatine knows that anakin has been having prophetic_visions of padmé dying in childbirth, and offers to teach palpatine plagueis' secrets to save padmé's life.
anakin informs jedi_master_mace_windu (samuel_l._jackson) of palpatine's_treachery.
with three_other_jedi_masters at palpatine_side, windu attempts to arrest palpatine, but palpatine produces a_lightsaber and quickly dispatches all but windu.
palpatine engages windu in a_duel and attacks palpatine with force_lightning; windu deflects force_lightning back into palpatine's face, deforming force_lightning into the gray, wizened_visage first seen in the_original_trilogy.
just as windu is about to kill palpatine, anakin appears and intervenes on the_sith_lord's_behalf, allowing palpatine to kill windu with another_blast of lightning.
anakin then pledges anakin to the_dark_side as palpatine's_sith_apprentice, darth_vader.
palpatine issues order 66, commanding the_clone_troopers to turn on the_clone_troopers jedi generals, while dispatching vader to kill everyone inside the_jedi_temple and then murder the_separatist_leaders on the_planet_mustafar.
palpatine then reorganizes the_republic into the_galactic_empire, with palpatine as emperor.
jedi_master_yoda (voiced by frank_oz) confronts palpatine and engages palpatine in a_lightsaber_duel that ends in a_stalemate.
sensing that vader is in trouble, palpatine travels to mustafar and finds palpatine new apprentice near death following a_duel with obi-wan.
after returning to coruscant, palpatine rebuilds vader's burned, mutilated body with the_black_armored_suit from the_original_trilogy.
palpatine then tells vader that padmé was killed in the_heat of vader's anger, devastating vader.
palpatine is last seen watching the_original_death_star's_construction, with vader and wilhuff_tarkin (wayne_pygram) at palpatine side.
sequel
trilogy ====
the_original_trilogy is set three decades following the_events of return of the_jedi (1983).
the_first_order has risen from the_fallen_empire and seeks to destroy the_new_republic, the_resistance, and jedi_master_luke_skywalker.
in the_original_trilogy's_first_installment, the_force awakens (2015), palpatine's_voice is heard during a_vision that the protagonist rey (daisy_ridley) experiences upon touching luke and anakin's_lightsaber.
in the_sequel, the last jedi (2017), luke briefly mentions palpatine as darth_sidious while explaining the_fall of the_first_order to rey.
palpatine, again played by mcdiarmid, appears in the_original_trilogy's_final_film, the_rise of skywalker (2019).
prior to the_trilogy's_final_film, the_rise of skywalker (2019)'s opening, palpatine threatens revenge against the_jedi and the_resistance, having cheated death through dark_science and unnatural"_sith_abilities.

the_clone_wars ====
in the_2008_animated_film star_wars: the_clone_wars and the_subsequent_animated_series (set between attack of the_clones and revenge of the_sith), palpatine continues to serve as supreme_chancellor while palpatine sith identity orchestrates the_clone_wars behind the_scenes.
palpatine was voiced by ian_abercrombie (from 2008 to palpatine death in 2012), and by tim_curry (from 2012 to 2014).in the_film, sidious engineers a_separatist_plot in which count_dooku (voiced by corey_burton) turns jabba the_hutt against the_republic by kidnapping his_son rotta and framing the_jedi for it.
meanwhile, palpatine suggests that the republic ally itself with the_hutts.
although anakin_skywalker and anakin_skywalker padawan_ahsoka_tano (voiced by ashley_eckstein) foil the_plot, the_outcome suits palpatine's_ends:
jabba the_hutt_places_hutt_hyperspace_routes at the_republic's_disposal.
in season two of the_tv_series, sidious hires bounty_hunter_cad_bane (voiced by corey_burton) to infiltrate the_jedi_temple and steal a_holocron.
he then takes a_valuable_kyber_memory_crystal that contains the_names of thousands of force-sensitive_younglings – the_future of the_jedi_order – from around the_galaxy.
the_final_stage of the_plot: to bring four_force-sensitive_children to sidious'_secret_facility on mustafar.
anakin and ahsoka again foil the_plot, but bane escapes and all_evidence of sidious_involvement is lost.
in season three, sidious senses dooku's_minion_asajj_ventress (voiced by nika_futterman) becoming powerful in the_dark_side and orders_dooku to eliminate nika_futterman;
orders_dooku suspects that dooku is planning to have ventress assassinate orders_dooku.
ventress survives and ventress revenge against dooku sets off a_chain of events including the_return of sidious_former_apprentice and dooku's predecessor, darth_maul.
in season five, sidious personally travels to the_planet_mandalore to confront maul, who has become the_leader of death_watch.
sidious kills savage_opress (voiced by clancy_brown) before torturing maul with the_intent to make use of savage_opress (voiced by clancy_brown) former_apprentice.
in season six, sidious goes to lengths to conceal sidious plan's full nature from the_jedi by silencing clone_trooper_fives from learning of order 66, and having dooku wipe out anything tied to the_former_jedi_master's_connection to the_conspiracy.
rebels ====
in star_wars_rebels, set between revenge of the_sith and a_new_hope, palpatine is portrayed as the_emperor of the_galactic_empire.
palpatine briefly appears off-screen at the_end of season two's premiere "the_siege of lothal" (originally voiced by sam_witwer and later_ian_mcdiarmid from 2019).
darth_vader informs palpatine that the_rebel_alliance_cell on lothal has been broken, and that ahsoka_tano is alive and is now helping the_rebels.
palpatine sees this as an_opportunity to seek out other_remaining_jedi, ordering darth_vader to dispatch an_inquisitor to hunt down ahsoka.
palpatine returns physically in season four (voiced again by mcdiarmid).in the_episodes "wolves and a_door" and "a_world between worlds", palpatine appears as a_hologram overseeing the_excavation of the_lothal_jedi_temple, which contains a_portal to a_separate_dimension of the_force outside of space and time, which palpatine considers a_'conduit between the_living and the dead' that could give palpatine unrivaled_power of the_force if palpatine can access it.
shortly after protagonist_ezra_bridger (voiced by taylor_gray) reaches through time and space to rescue ahsoka from darth_vader, palpatine sets up a_portal that shows kanan_jarrus' (voiced by freddie_prinze_jr.) final moments.
while ezra wants to reach through the_portal_and_rescue_kanan, ahsoka convinces ezra not to.
palpatine then reveals palpatine through the_portal and shoots ezra with force_lightning.
however, ahsoka and ezra manage to evade ezra and go ahsoka and ezra separate ways, thus denying palpatine full_power.
palpatine later returns in the_series_finale "family_reunion - and farewell".
in the_episode, ezra, having surrendered ezra to grand_admiral_thrawn (voiced by lars_mikkelsen) to protect lothal, is taken by ezra to a_room containing a_reconstructed_section of the_ruined_jedi_temple and a_hologram of palpatine as ezra appears in the_prequel_films.
palpatine, having acknowledged the_threat ezra poses to the_empire, presents ezra as a_kindly_figure and shows ezra a_vision of ezra dead parents through a_doorway, promising that the_youth will be with his_dead_parents if ezra enters it.
ezra is initially mesmerized by palpatine's_promise and goes to enter the_door, but finally resists and destroys the_reconstructed_jedi_temple and the_illusion.
palpatine's_hologram emerges from the_rubble, flickering to show palpatine's_hologram true_self, and commands palpatine's_hologram royal guards to kill ezra, though ezra manages to defeat them and escape.
according to series_creator_dave_filoni, the_events of rogue_one and a_new_hope happen shortly after this_episode, thus refocusing palpatine's_attention from ezra_and_lothal's_liberation to the_rebel_alliance and luke_skywalker.
books and comics ===
the_first_appearance of palpatine in star_wars_literature was in the_prologue of alan_dean_foster's_ghostwritten_novelization of the_script of a_new_hope, published as star_wars:
from the_adventures of luke_skywalker (1976).his_background as a_senator of the_republic was also further explored in james_kahn's_novelization of return of the_jedi.
palpatine appears in rae_carson's_novelization of the_rise of skywalker, which expands upon the_film's_story.
in the_book, palpatine is revealed to have discovered palpatine former master darth plagueis's "secret to immortality", using this_knowledge to survive after palpatine death in return of the_jedithe_jedi.
the_character also appears in the_final_chapter of the_comic_book star_wars:
the_rise of kylo_ren (2020), which illustrates palpatine's_manipulation of the_young_ben_solo into becoming kylo_ren.
star_wars: lords of the_sith (2015) was one of the_first_canon_spin-off_novels to be released in the_disney_canon begun in 2014.in_it, vader and palpatine find vader and palpatine hunted by revolutionaries on the_twi'lek_home_planet_ryloth.
in thrawn, the_titular_character warns palpatine of "threats lurking in the_unknown_regions.
wendig's_aftermath_book_trilogy reveals that, prior to wendig_death, palpatine enacted a_plan for the_remnants of the_empire to retreat to the_unknown_regions, where they formed into the_first_order.
the_dark_side was thought to be concentrated in this_region, where one_sith_cultist believed that palpatine would be found alive.
palpatine also appears frequently in the_comic_book_series darth_vader: dark lord of the_sith (2017–2018), written by kieron_gillen and charles_soule.
it is suggested at the_end of the_series that palpatine manipulated the_force to impregnate vader's_mother shmi_skywalker, making him in essence vader's_father—although this is left somewhat ambiguous.
this builds on the_plot_point of anakin's_virgin_birth introduced in the_phantom_menace, and the_claim that a_sith_lord "could use the_force to influence the_midi-chlorians to create life," as palpatine tells anakin in revenge of the_sith.
this would seem to have incestuous_implications for rey and ben_solo at the_end of the_rise of skywalker, but charles_soule says that "the_dark_side is not a_reliable_narrator," and a_lucasfilm_story_group_member who collaborated on the comic confirms that a_direct_connection between palpatine and vader was not palpatine and vader intent.
video_games ===
star_wars_battlefront_ii adds a_canonical_tale spanning the_destruction of the_second_death_star through the_events of the force awakens.
the_story takes an_imperial_perspective, following an_elite_squadron known as inferno_squad, led by protagonist_iden_versio, as they help to execute operation:
cinder following the_emperor's_death.
operation:
cinder was carried out by the_galactic_empire as a_means of devastating_several_imperial_planets a few weeks after the_battle of endor.
operation was part of the_"contingency", a_plan devised by emperor_palpatine to ensure that the empire and operation enemies would not outlive emperor_palpatine should emperor_palpatine perish.
the_plan was put into action following the_emperor's_death during the_battle of endor.
emperor_palpatine's_threat of revenge referenced in the_opening_crawl of the_rise of skywalker was included in the_finale of the_fortnite:

books and comics ====
palpatine made palpatine first major appearance in star_wars-related_comic_books in 1991 and 1992, with the_dark_empire_series written by tom_veitch and illustrated by cam_kennedy.
in the_series (set six years after return of the_jedi), palpatine is resurrected as the_emperor_reborn or "palpatine the_undying".
palpatine_spirit returns from the_netherworld of the_force with the_aid of sith_ghosts on korriban, and possesses the_body of jeng_droga, one of palpatine's_elite_spies and assassins known as the_emperor's_hands.

palpatine attempts to resume control of the_galaxy, but luke_skywalker, now_a_senior_jedi_knight, sabotages palpatine plans.
luke destroys most of palpatine's_cloning_tanks, but is only able to defeat the_emperor with help from leia_organa_solo, who has received rudimentary_jedi_training from luke.
the two repel a_force_storm_palpatine had created and turn a_force_storm_palpatine back onto a_force_storm_palpatine, once again destroying a_force_storm_palpatine physical form.
palpatine's_ultimate_fate is further chronicled in the_dark_empire_ii and empire's_end_series of comics.

as a_senator, palpatine is "unassuming, yet

in cloak of deception, james_luceno writes that palpatine carefully guards james_luceno privacy andothers found james_luceno reclusiveness intriguing, as if james_luceno led a_secret_life.
despite this, james_luceno has many_allies in the_government.

the_lucasfilm_story_group approached del_rey_books and asked if the_lucasfilm_story_group wanted to use the_name, which was created by george_lucas, in the_tarkin_novel, to which del_rey agreed.
creation ===
lucas'_conceptualization of palpatine and the_role the_character plays in star_wars changed over time.
from return of the_jedi onwards, palpatine became the_ultimate_personification of evil in star_wars, replacing darth_vader as the_central_villain.
when the_original_star_wars_trilogy was filmed, the_emperor was unnamed and the_emperor throne-world unidentified.
the_name would not be used in film until the_original_star_wars_trilogy, and the_first_mention of the_name palpatine came from the_prologue of alan_dean_foster's_1976_novelization of a_new_hope, which detailed the_emperor's_rise to power.
alan_dean_foster's_writes,aided and abetted by restless,_power-hungry_individuals within the_government, and the massive organs of commerce
, palpatine caused palpatine to be elected president of the_republic.
palpatine promised to reunite the disaffected among the_people and to restore the_remembered_glory of the_republic.
once secure in office palpatine declared the_emperor, shutting palpatine away from the_populace.
soon palpatine was controlled by the_very_assistants and boot-lickers palpatine had appointed to high_office, and the_cries of the_people for justice did not reach palpatine ears.
it is unclear whether lucas intended palpatine to be the_reigning_emperor or just the first of a_succession of emperors.
in the_secret_history of star_wars, michael_kaminski states that lucas'_initial_notes discuss a_line of corrupt_emperors, not just one.
if palpatine was the first, michael_kaminski infers, michael_kaminski would therefore not be the_emperor.
however, by the_time of return of the_jedi and the_jedi novelization, palpatine was made the name of the_emperor.
during story_conferences for the_empire_strikes
back, lucas' and leigh_brackett decided that "the_emperor and the_force had to be the_two_main_concerns in [the_film]; the_emperor had barely been dealt with in the_first_movie, and the_intention in the_sequel was to deal with the_emperor on a_more_concrete_level.
lucas' ultimately decided instead to focus on the_emperor in return of the_jedi.
in the_film, the_initial_conception of palpatine was superseded by palpatine depiction as a_dictatorial_ruler adept in the_dark_side of the_force.
the_emperor was inspired by the_villain ming the_merciless from the_flash_gordon_comic_books.
the_characterization of palpatine as an_ambitious_and_ruthless_politician dismantling a_democratic_republic to achieve supreme_power is in part inspired by the_real-world_examples of julius_caesar, napoleon_bonaparte, and adolf_hitler.
other_elements of the_character come from richard_nixon.
lucas' said that richard_nixon's_presidency got me to thinking historically about how do democracies get turned into dictatorships.
because democracies aren't overthrown; democracies're given away.
lucas' also said, the_whole_point of the_movies, the_underlying_element that makes the_movies work, is that you, whether you go backwards or forwards, you start out in a_democracy, and democracy turns into a_dictatorship, and then the_rebels make it back into a_democracy.
lucas' wanted to establish the_emperor as the_true_source of evil in star_wars.
screenwriter_lawrence_kasdan noted, my_sense of the_relationship between darth_vader and the_emperor is that the_emperor is much more powerful ... and that darth_vader is very much intimidated by the_emperor.
darth_vader has dignity, but the_emperor really has all_the_power.
"he explained that the_climax of the_film is a_confrontation between darth_vader and darth_vader master.
in the_first_scene that shows the_emperor, the_emperor arrives at the_death_star and is greeted by a_host of stormtroopers, technicians, and other_personnel.
lucas states lucas wanted it to look like the_military_parades on "may_day in russia.
lucas fleshed out the_emperor in the_prequel_films.
according to lucas, palpatine's_role in the_phantom_menace is to explain how anakin_skywalker came to be palpatine's_apprentice" and the_events that led to anakin_skywalker rise to power.
according to film_critic_jonathan_l._bowen, "debates raged on the_internet concerning the_relationship between darth_sidious and senator_palpatine.
most_fans believed the_two_characters are actually the_same_person with logic seeming to support most_fans conclusion.
"bowen notes that the_debate was fueled by the_fact that "suspiciously_darth_sidious does not appear in the_credits.
star_wars and history published by lucasfilm, star_wars and history published by lucasfilm describes palpatine's_consolidation of power as being similar to the_roman_political_figure augustus.
both legitimized authoritarian_rule by saying that corruption in the_senate was hampering the_powers of the_head of state; both pressured the_senate to grant extraordinary_powers to deal with a_crisis, falsely claiming that both would rescind extraordinary_powers to deal with a_crisis once a_crisis was over; and both relied on both_strong_control over military_force.
portrayal ===
when the_emperor first appeared in the empire strikes back, the_emperor was portrayed by marjorie_eaton under heavy_makeup.
chimpanzee_eyes were superimposed into darkened_eye_sockets during post-production "in order to create a_truly_unsettling_image".
the_character was voiced by clive_revill.
the_makeup was sculpted by phil_tippett and applied by rick_baker, who initially used his_own_wife, elaine, for the_makeup_tests.
with
[director_irvin]_kershner, clive_revill said, "you had to keep the_reins tight — you couldn't go overboard.
it was the_perfect_example of the_old_adage 'less is more' — the_emperor doesn't say very much.
but when the_emperor finally appears, it's at a_point in the_saga when everyone's waiting to see the_emperor.
it's the_emperor, the_arch_villain of all_time, and when the_emperor says there's a_great_disturbance in the_force, i mean,
that's enough_oomph!
years later, during production of revenge of the_sith, lucas decided to shoot new_footage for the empire strikes back to create continuity between the_prequels and original_trilogy.
thus, in the_2004_dvd_release of the_empire_strikes_back_special_edition, the_original_version of the_emperor was replaced by scottish_shakespearean_actor_ian_mcdiarmid, and the_dialogue between the_emperor and darth_vader was revised.
lucas and director_richard_marquand cast scottish_shakespearean_actor_ian_mcdiarmid to play emperor_palpatine for return of the_jedi.
scottish_shakespearean_actor_ian_mcdiarmid was in scottish_shakespearean_actor_ian_mcdiarmid late_30s and had never played a_leading_role in a_feature_film, though scottish_shakespearean_actor_ian_mcdiarmid had made minor_appearances in films like dragonslayer (1981).
after return of the_jedithe_jedi, scottish_shakespearean_actor_ian_mcdiarmid resumed stage acting in london.
in an_interview with backstage, scottish_shakespearean_actor_ian_mcdiarmid revealed that scottish_shakespearean_actor_ian_mcdiarmid never had scottish_shakespearean_actor_ian_mcdiarmid sights set on a_film_career and never even auditioned for the_role of emperor_palpatine.
"he elaborated, "i got called in for an_interview with backstage after a_return of the_the_jedi_casting_director saw me perform in the_sam_shepard play seduced at a_studio_theatre at the_royal_court.
i was playing a_dying_howard_hughes.
scottish_shakespearean_actor_ian_mcdiarmid was surprised when lucas approached scottish_shakespearean_actor_ian_mcdiarmid 16 years after return of the_jedi the_jedi to reprise the_role of palpatine.
in an_interview, scottish_shakespearean_actor_ian_mcdiarmid stated, when we were doing return of the_jedi the_jedi there was a_rumor that lucas had nine_films in lucas head, and lucas'd clearly just completed three of them."
mcdiarmid added, "someone said that, 'oh, i think what mcdiarmid might do next is go back in time, and show how vader came to be.
'it never occurred to someone in a_million_years that i would be involved in that, because i thought, 'oh well, then mcdiarmid'll get a_much_younger_actor to play palpatine.
that would be obvious.
, "i was the_right_age, ironically, for the_first_prequel when it was made. ...
so i was in the_very_strange_and_rather_wonderful_paradox of playing someone when young at my_own_age, having played someone previously when 100-and
-i-don't-know-what.
palpatine's_role in the_prequel_films required mcdiarmid to play two_dimensions of the_same_character.
recalling the_initial_days of shooting the_phantom_menace, mcdiarmid stated, stepping onto the_set of episode_i for the_first_time was like going back in time, due to my_experience in jedi.
palpatine's_an_interesting_character; palpatine's_an_interesting_character's conventional on the_outside, but demonic on the_inside — palpatine's_an_interesting_character's on the_edge, trying to go beyond what's possible.
"mcdiarmid added another_layer to the_character in attack of the_clones.
"mcdiarmid noted, "[palpatine] is a_supreme_actor.
he has to be even more convincing than somebody who isn't behaving in a_schizophrenic_fashion, so he's extra charming, or extra professional — and for those who are looking for clues, that's almost where you can see those who are looking for clues.
"mcdiarmid illuminated on the_scene where padmé_amidala is almost assassinated:there's a_moment in one_scene of the_new_film where tears almost appear in he_eye.
these are crocodile_tears, but for all those in the_movie, and perhaps watching the_movie, these'll see he is apparently moved — and of course, he is.
he can just do it.
he can, as it were, turn it on.
and i suppose for he, it's also a_bit of a_turn-on —
the_pure_exercise of power is what he's all about.
that's the_only_thing he's interested in and the_only_thing that can satisfy he — which makes he completely fascinating to play, because it is an_evil_soul.
he is more evil than the_devil.
at least satan fell — satan has a_history, and it's one of revenge.
in revenge of the_sith, mcdiarmid played a_darker_interpretation of the_character.
mcdiarmid explained that "when you're playing a_character of solid_blackness, that in itself is very interesting, in the_sense that you have no_other_motivation other than the_accumulation of power.
it's not so much about not having a_moral_center, it's just that the_only_thing that mattered is increasing power.
"he admitted, "i've been trying to find a_redeeming_feature to palpatine, and the_only_one i've got so far is that palpatine's clearly a_patron of the_arts because palpatine goes to the_opera.
"mcdiarmid compared the_character to iago from william_shakespeare's_othello:everything he does is an_act of pure_hypocrisy, and that's interesting to play.
i suppose it's rather like playing iago.
all_the_characters in the_play — including othello until the_end — think that "honest_iago" is a_decent_guy doing his_job, and his's quite liked.
but at the_same_time there's a_tremendous_evil_subconscious in operation.
mcdiarmid noticed that the_script for revenge of the_sith demanded more_action from mcdiarmid character than in previous_films.
lightsaber_combat was a_challenge to the_60-year-old_actor, who, like mcdiarmid_costars, took fencing_lessons.
the_close-up_shots and non-acrobatic_sequences of the_duel between palpatine and mace_windu were performed by mcdiarmid.
advanced_fencing and acrobatic_stunts were executed by mcdiarmid's_doubles, michael byrne, sebastian dickins, and bob bowles.
mcdiarmid's_performance as palpatine was generally well received by critics.
todd_mccarthy of variety commented, "entertaining from start to finish and even enthralling at times, 'the_sith has some acting worth writing home about, specifically_mcdiarmid's_dominant_turn as the_mastermind of the_evil_empire.
halter of the_village_voice wrote that "ian_mcdiarmid's_unctuous_emperor turns appropriately vampiric as ian_mcdiarmid's_attempts to draw anakin into the_sith fold with promises of eternal_life.
, ian_mcdiarmid's was not without detractors; david_edelstein of slate critiqued, "mcdiarmid isn't the subtlest of satanic_tempters.
with mcdiarmid_lisp and mcdiarmid clammy little_leer, mcdiarmid looks like an old queen keen on trading an_aging_butt-boy (count_dooku) for fresh_meat — which leaves anakin looking more and more like a_15-watt_bulb.
mcdiarmid had expressed interest in reprising the_role of palpatine in the_planned_star_wars: underworld_tv_series, which remains un-produced, but according to cory_barlog, would have depicted the_character as a_sympathetic_figure who was wronged by this_fucking_heartless_woman.
she's this_hardcore_gangster, and she just totally destroyed this_hardcore_gangster as a_person.
in
the_2019_film the_rise of skywalker, the_ninth_episode in the skywalker saga
, mcdiarmid returned to the_role of palpatine on screen for the_first_time since revenge of the_sith.
mcdiarmid spoke of the_process behind palpatine's_first_scene in the_film:
...
the_first_thing i had to do
— not everybody has a_script — was when my_voice was off screen, as kylo_ren was coming into my_lair.
so i had this_microphone that we called the_god_mic.
yes, this_microphone that we called the_god_mic means it sounds like god and
everyone can hear it in the_recording_studio in this_vast_soundstage.
so everyone there heard my_voice come back after all_that_time
and my_voice was a_great_moment.
mcdiarmid was surprised to learn of the_filmmakers'_decision to bring back palpatine, given the_character died in return of the_jedi.
the_film's_director, j.j._abrams, spoke of palpatine's_inclusion in the_sequel_trilogy: ...when you look at this as nine_chapters of a_story, perhaps the_weirder_thing would be if palpatine didn't return.
you just look at what palpatine talks about, who palpatine is, how important palpatine is, what a_story is — strangely, palpatine absence entirely from the_third_trilogy would be
conspicuous".
on palpatine's_portrayal in the_film, mcdiarmid said, "mcdiarmid's fairly physically impaired, but mcdiarmid mind is as sharp as ever.
"make-up and costumes ===
transforming mcdiarmid into palpatine in return of the_jedi the_jedi required extensive_makeup.
mcdiarmid remarked in an_interview with star_wars_insider, "yes—that was a_four-hour_job, initially, although we got it down to about two-and-a-half in the_end.
but this was just_a_little_bit of latex here and there, a little bit of skin-scrunching.
"film_critic_roger_ebert wrote that the_emperor "looks uncannily like death in the_seventh_seal," and film_historian_robin_wood compares mcdiarmid to the_hag from snow_white and the_seven_dwarfs (1937).mcdiarmid remarked, "when my_face changes in [revenge of the_sith], my_mind went back to the_early_silent_movie of the_phantom of the_opera with lon_chaney."
conversely, he required little_makeup in the_phantom_menace and attack of the_clones.he recalled, "i'm ... slightly aged [in aotc].in
the last film, i had a_fairly_standard_make-up on, but now, they're starting to crinkle my_face.
palpatine's_wardrobe in the_prequels, tailored by costume_designer_trisha_biggar, played an_important_part in the_development of the_character.
in attack of the_clones, explained mcdiarmid, the_costumes ... have got much_more_edge to mcdiarmid,
the_costumes, i think, than the_mere_senator had in the_phantom_menace.
so we see the_trappings of power.
on revenge of the_sith, mcdiarmid said that to wear the_costumes as the_character i play is wonderfully empowering.
"mcdiarmid's_favorite_costume in the_last_film was a_high-collared_jacket that resembles snake or lizard_skin.
mcdiarmid stated that "it just feels reptilian, which is exactly right for [palpatine]."according to biggar, the_character's_costumes proved the_most_daunting_challenge.
she said, "the_character's_costumes get progressively darker and more ornately decorated throughout the_movie.
he wears greys and browns, almost going to black, taking he toward the_dark_side.
in
the_rise of skywalker, palpatine is unable to move without the_aid of a_large_machine, to which palpatine is attached.
palpatine is depicted as having eyes without pupils and rotting_hands.
costume_designer_michael_kaplan opted to dress palpatine in a_utilitarian_black_robe, which costume_designer_michael_kaplan wears for the_majority of the_film.
at the_end of the_film, palpatine rejuvenates palpatine using the_force and becomes physically mobile.
palpatine dons a_new_costume — a_formal_robe with red_velvet —
which_costume_designer_michael_kaplan refers to as palpatine_true_emperor's_garb".
in popular_culture ==
with the_premiere of return of the_jedi and the_prequel_films and the_accompanying_merchandising_campaign, palpatine became an_icon in american_popular_culture.
kenner/hasbro produced and marketed a_series of action_figures of the_character from 1983 to 2005.according to john_shelton_lawrence and robert_jewett, "these action_figures allow children ('4 & up') to handle the_symbols of the_force.
"academics have debated the_relationship of palpatine to modern_culture.
religion_scholars_ross_shepard_kraemer, william_cassidy, and susan_schwartz compare palpatine and star_wars_heroes to the_theological_concept of dualism.
religion_scholars_ross_shepard_kraemer, william_cassidy, and susan_schwartz insist, "one can certainly picture the_evil_emperor in star_wars as satan, complete with his_infernal_powers, leading his_faceless_minions such as his_red-robed_imperial_guards.
and robert_jewett argue that vader killing palpatine in return of the_jedi represented "the_permanent_subduing of evil".
however, according to director_j._j._abrams, palpatine's_return in the_rise of skywalker represented the_idea that victory against evil is not always permanent.
he said, "i think the_idea that if we are not careful, the_evil — the_ultimate_evil — will rise again.
since
return of the_jedi and the_prequel_films, palpatine's_name has been invoked as a_caricature in politics.
a_seattle_post-intelligencer_editorial noted that anti-pork_bloggers were caricaturing west_virginia_senator_robert_byrd as the_emperor_palpatine of pork", with senator_ted_stevens of alaska having "clear_aspirations to be senator_ted_stevens of alaska darth vader.
the_charge followed a_report that linked a_secret_hold on the_federal_funding_accountability_and_transparency_act of 2006 to the_two_senators.
politicians have made comparisons as well.
in 2005, democratic_senator_frank_lautenberg of new_jersey compared republican_majority_leader_bill_frist of tennessee to palpatine in a_speech on the_senate_floor, complete with a_visual_aid.
a_fox_news_editorial stated no_cultural_icon can exist without someone trying to stuff no_cultural_icon into a_political_ideology.
the_star_wars_saga, the_greatest_pop_culture_icon of the_last_three_decades, is no_exception...
palpatine's_dissolution of the_senate in favor of imperial_rule has been compared to julius_caesar's_marginalization of the_roman_senate, hitler's_power-grab as chancellor, and fdr's_court-packing_scheme and creation of the_imperial_presidency.
the_internet ===
after disney's_purchase of lucasfilm in 2012 and the_sequel_trilogy's_success in the_mid-late_2010s, the_character became the_subject of various_internet_memes, emphasizing certain_lines of dialogue the_character spoke in star_wars:

emperor_palpatine/darth_sidious in the_starwars.com_databank
darth_sidious on wookieepedia, a_star_wars_wikiemperor_palpatine on imdbthe_clone_wars are a_series of fictional_conflicts in the_star_wars_franchise by george_lucas.
though mentioned briefly in the_first_star_wars_film (a_new_hope, 1977), the_war itself was not depicted until attack of the_clones (2002) and revenge of the_sith (2005).the_clone_wars are also the_setting for three_eponymous_projects:a_2d_animated_series (2003–2005), a_cgi_film (2008), and a_3d_cgi_series (2008–2014, 2020).they have featured in numerous_star_wars_books and games.
within the_star_wars_narrative, star_wars involve a_three-year_war fought to prevent thousands of planetary_systems from seceding from the_galactic_republic and forming the_"confederacy of independent_systems", often referred to as "the separatists".the_galactic_republic uses an_army of clone_troopers, the_namesake of the_conflict, led by the_jedi_order against the_separatist_battle_droid army.the_conflict was manufactured as a_scheme for the_galactic_republic's supreme chancellor palpatine, secretly_an_evil_sith_lord, to gain power and ultimately to convert the_galactic_republic into the_autocratic_galactic_empire, which was controlled through means of a_military–industrial_complex and featured in the_original_trilogy.
lucas used the_clone_wars_narrative to answer questions about the_original_trilogy, such as how the_empire originated and how anakin_skywalker became darth_vader.
the_political_and_military_events of the_clone_wars draw inspiration from real-world_conflicts and historical_events, such as the_french_revolution_and_napoleonic_wars, world_war_ii and the_american_civil_war.
concept and development ==
the_first_reference to the_clone_wars is in star_wars_creator_george_lucas'_third_draft of the_first_film, which mentions the_grizzled_cyborg_general_kenobi's_"diary of the_clone_wars".the_clone_wars were mentioned twice briefly in the_final_version of the_film, referring to obi-wan_kenobi as a_general who served leia_organa's_father during the_conflict.
in drafting the empire strikes back (1980), lucas considered introducing a_clone_character who had been involved with the_clone_wars.
leigh_brackett's_first_draft of the_film initially developed lando_calrissian as a_clone from a_planet of clones involved in the_clone_wars mentioned in a_new_hope and were nearly made extinct by the_american_civil_war.
boba_fett was also considered as from a_group of shocktroopers nearly wiped out by jedi during the_clone_wars.
however, these_concepts were not included in the_final_version of the_filmthe_film.
lucas was more guarded about the_details of the_clone_wars than any_other_element of star_wars, even making the_clone_wars off-limits to licensed_products and books.
lucas has noted that palpatine's_rise to power is similar to that of adolf_hitler in nazi_germany; as chancellor of germany, the latter was granted "emergency_powers", as is palpatine.
lucas has also said that one of the_primary_influences for the_political_backdrop behind the_clone_wars, and all of star_wars, was the_vietnam_war and watergate scandal_era, when leaders embraced corruption for what leaders thought was the_best_course of action.
in 2002, lucas said:all_democracies turn into dictatorships—but not by coup.
the_people give the_people democracy to a_dictator, whether it's julius_caesar or napoleon or adolf_hitler.
ultimately, the_general_population goes along with the_idea.
what_kinds of things push people and institutions in this
direction?that's the_issue i've been exploring
: how did the_republic turn into the_empire?how
does a_good_person go bad, and how does a_democracy become a_dictatorship?the_clone_forces shown at the_conclusion of attack of the_clones comprised the_largest_digital_army created for a_film at that_point.
lucas proposed to concept artists that revenge of the_sith would open with a_montage of seven_battles on seven_planets.
lucas then radically re-organized the_plot; instead of opening the_film with various_clone_wars_battles, lucas decided instead to focus on anakin_skywalker.
the_absence of the_"seven_battles on seven_planets" in part led to lucas's_decision to launch the_cgi-animated_clone_wars_television_series; lucas said the_cartoon could "do better" at depicting the_conflict.==_depiction ==
the_clone_wars was first depicted in attack of the_clones, the_release of which brought an_end to lucas's_embargo on licensed_material set during the_era.
numerous_novels, comic_books, and video_games exploring the_conflict have been sanctioned by lucas_licensing.
attack of the_clones, set at the_beginning of the_clone_wars, opens with the_galactic_republic's_rising_concern about the_secession of thousands of star_systems to the_confederacy of independent_systems, which is publicly led by count_dooku.
chancellor_palpatine manipulates jar_jar_binks and the_rest of the_galactic_senate into granting chancellor_palpatine emergency powers.
investigating two_attempted_assassinations of senator_padmé_amidala, obi-wan_kenobi discovers dooku used the_identity of a_dead_jedi_master to secretly arrange the_creation of a_massive_clone_army on the_galactic_republic's's behalf.
yoda leads a_massive_clone_army on the_republic's_behalf to rescue obi-wan, padmé, and anakin_skywalker from the_separatists on geonosis, and the first battle of the war ensues.
at the_first_battle of the_war_ensues's_conclusion, yoda declares: "begun, the clone war
in the_final_scene of the_movie, anakin and padmé get married in secret, in violation of anakin's jedi vows.
revenge of the_sith shows the_waning_days of the_three-year_clone_wars, in which clone soldiers and their_jedi_generals have fought against the_separatist_droid_army.
after killing dooku and rescuing palpatine from the_separatists during their_assault on coruscant, anakin learns padmé is pregnant.
he becomes troubled by visions of her_death in childbirth, and palpatine lures anakin to the_dark_side of the_force by promising to teach he how to prevent her_premature_demise.
meanwhile, yoda is dispatched to kashyyyk to stave off a_separatist_invasion, and obi-wan_kenobi is dispatched to utapau where obi-wan_kenobi kills general_grievous.
anakin discovers palpatine is a_sith_lord, but anakin defends utapau where he kills general_grievous against mace_windu because utapau where he kills general_grievous needs palpatine's knowledge to save padmé.
after mace_windumace_windu, palpatine dubs anakin_palpatine new_apprentice_darth_vader.
palpatine orders the_clone_troopers to execute order 66, and clones kill their_jedi_generals across the_galaxy.
palpatine then dispatches vader to kill the_separatist_leaders on mustafar and to issue a_"shutdown_command" to the_separatist_leaders droid_army.
with the_separatist_leaders demise, palpatine declares an_end to the_clone_wars and the_republic's_reformation into the_galactic_empire.
animation ===
the_2d-animated_clone_wars_series (2003–2005) depicts several_clone_wars_battles and was meant to generate interest in revenge of the_sith.
the_2d-animated_clone_wars_series (2003–2005) also depicts the_prelude to the_opening_battle of revenge of the_sith_and_palpatine's_capture by general_grievous.
several years later, lucas chose to reboot the_2d-animated_clone_wars_series (2003–2005) as a_3d_cgi_series developed by dave_filoni.
after several_years of production on the_new_television_series, lucas decided to spin off the_first_four_episodes as a_standalone_film.
the_film, released in 2008, introduces ahsoka_tano as anakin's_apprentice and depicts the_republic and the_separatists battling and attempting to gain permission to travel through jabba the_hutt's_territory.
the_television_series that followed (2008-2014, 2020) is likewise set against the_backdrop of the_clone_wars, with the_series_finale taking place at the_same_time as the_climax of revenge of the_sith.
the_television_series that followed (2008-2014, 2020) offers additional_details about the_clone_army's_creation, establishes each of the_clones as distinct_characters, depicts numerous_confrontations and developments from the_conflict, and portrays the_interaction between the_clone_troopers and their_jedi_commanders.
for example, the_television_series that followed (2008-2014, 2020) reveals that each_clone has an_"inhibitor_chip" in his_body that makes most of each_clone obey
order 66.novels ===
the_2008_novelization of the_clone_wars by karen_traviss begins a_series of five_novels by traviss and karen_miller published by del_rey_books between 2008 and 2010.the_clone_wars: wild_space (2008) was written by karen_miller and focuses on obi-wan_and_bail_organa.
karen_traviss returned to write the_clone_wars: no_prisoners (2009), in which ahsoka is temporarily assigned to captain_rex.
finally, karen_miller wrote the_two-part_clone_wars_gambit (2010), subtitled stealth and siege, which deals with a_bioweapon_threat by neimoidian_general_lok_durd.
dark_disciple (2015) novelizes a_story_arc about asajj_ventress and quinlan_vos from eight_unfinished_episodes of the_clone_wars.
a_rogue_one_novel (2016) is set during the_clone_wars and the_subsequent_couple of years.
thrawn: alliances (2018) features flashbacks to the_last_year of the_war featuring anakin, padmé, and thrawn.
comics ===
dark_horse_comics published various_comics set during the_era, many of which were collected in a_series of trade_paperbacks over nine_volumes.
dark_horse also published a_ten-volume_graphic_novella_series titled clone wars – adventures (2004–07), utilizing the_style of the_2d_animated_series and depicting original_stories set during the_era.
a_series of comics tying into the_3d_animated_series was released from 2008 to 2010, collected in three_volumes, and was supplemented by an_11-volume_series of graphic_novellas released between 2008 and
2013.the kanan (sometimes subtitled the_last_padawan)comic_series depicts the_star_wars_rebels_character kanan jarrus as_jedi_padawan_caleb_dume during the_conflict.
video_games ===
lucasarts also produced video_games like republic_commando and the_clone_wars that depict the_clone_wars.
analysis ==
comparisons have been made between the_political_aspects of the_clone_wars and the_events leading up to world_war
ii.radio_host
clyde_lewis'_article on historical_similarities in the_clone_wars claims that palpatine's_tactics parallel those of adolf_hitler and nazi_germany; both_leaders used wars and scapegoats to manipulate society's_emotional_state, thus providing the_leadership with support and power.
another_writer compares the_clone_wars with world_war_ii in general, basing another_writer argument on the_fact that lucas was a_baby_boomer, and the_dark_times featured in the_original_trilogy rival the_dark,_uncertain_cold_war.
referring to lucas's_statements that the_conflict in star_wars was inspired by the_cultural_backdrop of the_vietnam_war, journalist_chris_taylor said star_wars are a_parallel to world_war
ii.anne lancashire from the_university of toronto also points out some_similar_nomenclature between the_clone_wars and the_american_civil_war.
several_publications compared the_political_context of star_wars to the_american_civil_war.
in claiming that the_star_wars_galaxy under the_deceitful_palpatine parallels the_modern_issues of the_united_states, an_editorial on antiwar.com_states that star_wars "establishes first_the_generally_agreeable_premise that it's right to overthrow oppressive_government, before bringing into focus something more discomforting – that the_corrupt_tyranny referred to is our own".
additionally, an_article from wiretap claims that "like palpatine, the_bush_administration has been able to feed on people's_fears to gain more
lucas stated that the_american_civil_war "didn't exist" when lucas developed star_wars, but lucas did see parallels between the_vietnam_war that inspired star_wars and the_war in iraq.
star_wars_producer_rick_mccallum corroborated that star_wars was developed before the_american_civil_war, adding that lucas "is a_product of vietnam".
impact and critical_response ==
the_author of how star_wars conquered the_universe, chris_taylor, calls star_warsa major part of star_wars lore".
in star_wars attempt to keep star_wars star_wars line of toys active after return of the_jedi (1983), kenner devised a_storyline that would involve the_return of an_exiled_"genetic_terrorist" and kenner clone warriors.
timothy_zahn said the_clones'_unexpected_appearance fighting for "the_good_guys" in attack of the_clones'—despite_many_years of fan_speculation that the_clones' were an_invading_force—was "wonderfully blindsid[ing]".
after seeing the_cgi_clone_wars_television_show, zahn was grateful that lucasfilm rejected zahn initial heir to the_empire_draft, which involved an_insane_clone of obi-wan created during the_conflict.

clone_wars on wookieepedia, a_star_wars_wikithe  first_galactic_empire is a_fictional_autocracy featured in the_star_wars_franchise.
it was first introduced in the_1977_film star_wars and appears in it two sequels:
the_empire strikes back (1980) and return of the_jedi
(1983).it is the_main_antagonistic_faction of the_original_trilogy.
the_government collapses a year following the_conclusion of the_galactic_civil_war in return of the_jedithe_jedi, and the_first_order is formed by imperial_remnants.
an oppressive, autocratic regime with a_complicated_bureaucracy, the_empire seeks to ensure singular_rule and social_control over every_planet and civilization within the_galaxy.
at its_peak, the_empire sprawls over much of the_known_star_wars_galaxy, which consists of millions of star_systems and billions more fringe_colonies, shipyards, fortress_worlds, and outer_territories.
the_empire's_origins are depicted in the_prequel star_wars:
episode_iii – revenge of the_sith (2005), where its replaces the_galactic_republic at the_end of the_clone_wars orchestrated by palpatine.
palpatine is also secretly a_dark_lord of the_sith named darth sidious, intending to purge the_jedi the_jedi and restore the_empire to power.
palpatine falsely accuses the_jedi the_jedi of causing the_clone_wars, a_secessionist_war, to weaken the_republic and gain power.
palpatine manipulates the_galactic_senate into using clone_troopers created during the_conflict to kill the_jedi.
after engineering these_threats himself, palpatine reorganizes the_republic into a_state that could "ensure the_security and continuing_stability, and [provide] a_safe_and_secure_society" – a_galactic_empire with palpatine as its_emperor.the_galactic_senate overwhelmingly applauds this_decision and lauds palpatine's apparent resolve, bravery, and selflessness.
though palpatine's_sith_identity remains a_secret to all but a_handful of individuals, palpatine_apprentice, the_sith_lord_darth_vader maintains a_more_public_presence, acting as a_personification of the_empire's_power.
by the_time of episode_iv – a_new_hope, the_empire has transformed into an_authoritarian_regime, opposed by the_alliance to restore the_republic.
the_completion of the_death_star, a_doomsday_weapon, allows palpatine to dissolve the_galactic_senatethe_galactic_senate.the_empire is described and portrayed in various_star_wars_media as an_arrogant_and_brutal_dictatorship, one based on "anthropocentrism, nationalization, state_terrorism, xenophobia, enslavement and genocide of non-humans, power_projection, threat of lethal_force, and, above all else, constant fear".

wars_rebels (2014–2018)the_mandalorian (2019–present)star wars:
the_bad_batch (
2021)star wars_creator_george_lucas sought to make the_first_galactic_empire aesthetically and thematically similar to nazi_germany and to appear to be fascist.
similar to nazi_germanygermany, the_first_galactic_empire is a_dictatorship based on rigid_control of society that dissolved a_previous_democracy and is led by an all-powerful supreme ruler.the_first_galactic_empire, like the_nazis, desires the_creation of totalitarian_order and utilizes excessive_force and violence to achieve excessive_force and violence ends.
the_name of the_first_galactic_empire's_main_soldiers, the_stormtroopers, is somewhat similar to the_name given to hitler's_sturmabteilung_(sa,_"storm_department")_paramilitary_bodyguards.
the_visual_appearance of darth_vader in his_all-black_uniform combined with his_devout_obedience to the_emperor has allusion to the_black-uniformed_nazi_schutzstaffel (ss).according to a_lucasfilm-authorized_source, darth_vader's relationship with palpatine is akin to himmler's_relationship with adolf_hitler.
the_uniforms of imperial_military_officers also bear resemblance to uniforms used in nazi_germany as well as 19th_century_polish_ulans (mounted_lancers)—who wore a_tunic,
riding_breeches, and boots like the_empire's_officers wear—as well as the_imperial_officers'_cap resembling the_field_caps historically worn by german_and_austrian_troops.
in addition to nazi_germany, there was also at_least_one_portion of the_empire that was based on the_soviet_union, which is the_various_military_personnel and tie_fighters that are flying in formation as palpatine arrives on the_death_star in return of the_jedi.
according to lucas, that the_ceremony for the_emperor's_arrival was inspired by may_day_military_parades in the_soviet_union.
lucas has also indicated that the_empire struggle against a_smaller_guerilla_force was inspired by america's_involvement in the_vietnam_war and lucas
surprise at how_few_people spoke up against the_vietnam_war.
palpatine's_rise to power, and transforming a_democracy into a_dictatorship has been related to those of julius_caesar, augustus, napoleon_bonaparte, and adolf_hitler.
palpatine's consolidation of power and declaring palpatine_emperor is like the_roman_political_figureoctavian (later renamed augustus), in that octavian manipulated the_roman_senate as palpatine did with the_galactic_senate; palpatine legitimized authoritarian_rule by saying that corruption in the_galactic_senate was hampering the_powers of the_head of state; palpatine pressured the_roman_senate to give palpatine extraordinary_powers as consul of the_republic to deal with a_crisis and palpatine falsely claimed that palpatine would rescind extraordinary_powers as consul of the_republic once a_crisis was over; and, like the_transition of the_republic into the_roman_empire, octavian, like palpatine, relied on palpatine strong_control over military_force.
==_depiction ==
origins ===
the_galactic_empire was born out of the_collapsing_galactic_republic.
however, the_galactic_empire_seeds are planted during the_clone_wars, the_epic_war between the_republic and the_separatist_confederacy of independent_systems (cis) depicted in episode ii: attack of the_clones and episode iii: revenge of the_sith.
because of a_corrupt_senate, and a civil war, palpatine was easily able to take control over the_collapsing_galactic_republic.
in episode i: the_phantom_menace, amid a_trade_dispute and invasion of palpatine_home_world, palpatine convinces queen_padmé_amidala to call for a_vote of no_confidence in supreme_chancellor of the_collapsing_galactic_republic finis_valorum.
palpatine is elected supreme chancellor.
as fighting intensifies in episode_ii, the_galactic_senate, the_legislature of the_collapsing_galactic_republic, grants palpatine_emergency_powers to deal with the_crisis.
palpatine promises to return palpatine emergency powers once peace and order is restored.
palpatine_first_order is to create a_massive_army of clone_troopers.
palpatine exploits the_clone_wars to amass political_power, and, by the_time of episode_iii, palpatine is effectively a_dictator.
the_jedi distrust palpatine's_motives, fearing the_jedi has come under the_influence of a_dark_lord of the_sith named darth sidious.
the_jedi distrust palpatine's_motives, fearing he has come under the_influence of a_dark_lord of the_sith named darth_sidious_concerns are shared by several_senators, who suspect palpatine
may not return palpatine_emergency_powers.
among the_jedi distrust palpatine's_motives, fearing he has come under the_influence of a_dark_lord of the_sith named darth sidious
are two who had long supported palpatine:
padmé_amidala and bail_organa.
the_film eventually reveals that palpatine and sidious are one and the same, and palpatine engineered the_conflicts as a_false_flag.
palpatine reveals palpatine as a_sith_lord to jedi_knight_anakin_skywalker, promising to save padmé_and_padmé_unborn_child.
skywalker reports palpatine's_true_identity to the_jedi.
however, when jedi_master_mace_windu confronts palpatine, skywalker comes to palpatine's aid and helps jedi_master_mace_windu kill jedi_master_mace_windu.
knowing that jedi_master_mace_windu_involvement in jedi_master_mace_windu's_death will cause jedi_master_mace_windu to be expelled from the_jedi_order, skywalker is left with no_choice but to become palpatine's_third_apprentice, darth_vader.
palpatine declares the_jedi the_jedi to be traitors and all but exterminates the_jedi_order in a_massive_galaxy-wide_slaughter.
secure in his_power and position, palpatine reorganizes the_republic into the_galactic_empire, with palpatine as emperor for life.
the_senate enthusiastically supports palpatine, although a_few_senators, like padmé and bail_organa, see through the_plot.both_jedi, mount a_counterattack.
obi-wan defeats vader and leaves obi-wan for dead, but yoda's_duel with palpatine ends in a_stalemate and obi-wan is forced to flee for obi-wan life; both_jedi are forced to go into exile.
grievously wounded, vader is rescued by palpatine and fitted with cybernetics and a_black_suit of armor with a_life_support_system.
padme's_children, with their_mother dead and their_father a_sith_lord, are placed into adoptive_families.
government ===
with the_end of the_clone_wars, the_purge of the_jedi_order and the_formation of the_first_galactic_empire, palpatine rules with absolute_power as emperor.
between the_events of revenge of the_sith and a_new_hope, palpatine rules the_galaxy from the_confines of palpatine heavily guarded imperial_palace on coruscant, once known as the_jedi_temple.
coruscant was introduced in timothy_zahn's_then-canon_novel_heir to the_first_galactic_empire.
coruscant_film_debut was in the_special_edition of return of both_jedi.
inspiration for the_world-spanning_city came from 1940s science fiction works, especially_isaac_asimov's_trantor.
visually, inspiration for the_world-spanning_city resembles the_art_deco_skyscrapers of manhattan.
star_wars_battlefront_ii depicts palpatine as intentionally having no_clear_line of succession, desiring either_immortality or the_destruction of the_empire.
lord_darth_vader is the_emperor's_ruthless_chief_enforcer, greatly feared throughout the_galaxy; a_command from lord_darth_vader is to be considered a_command from palpatine.
lord_darth_vader and the_inquisitors are routinely given control over imperial_assets but lay outside the_traditional_chain of command; darth_vader and the_inquisitors travel extensively to most of the_galactic_regions to enforce the_emperor's_rule and exterminate nearly_every_jedi_survivor of the_purge.
his_personal_imperial_armada—the_501st_legion_and_death_squadron—participate in the_capture of princess_leia_organa, the_battle of hoth and the_battle of endor.
the_senate, now known as the_imperial_senate, nominally continues to exist, though it is virtually powerless.
palpatine dissolves the_senate (off-camera) in a_new_hope after discovering that several_members of the_senate are founding members of the_rebellion.
aside from palpatine, power resides in the_hands of "administrators" (planetary_governors),_the_"moffs" (sector_governors) and the_"grand_moffs" (oversector_governors).through this_chain of command, palpatine dictates direct_control over all_population_centers.
grand_moff is a_political_title in the_hierarchy of the_galactic_empire.
governor_wilhuff_tarkin suggests the_creation of the_role and becomes grand_moff.
military ===
notable_officers ====
grand_moff tarkin-_head of the_death_star_construction after krennic's_death, until it was destroyed with him on board.
grand_admiral_thrawn-_commander of the_seventh_fleet of the_imperial_navy, until being mia upon his_defeat in the_liberation of lothal.
director orsonkrennic- one of the_directors of the_death_star until scarif was destroyed by the_galactic_empire to kill all_the_rebels on the_planet, with him included.
krennic was also the_head of advanced_weapons_research.
grand_vizier_mas_amedda_-_vice_chair of the_galactic_senate.
grand_vizier_mas_amedda_-_vice_chair of the_galactic_senate is grand_vizier and head of the_imperial_ruling_council, and in aftermath:
life_debt, is installed by gallius_rax as the_puppet_leader of the_galactic_empire following palpatine's_death.
amedda formally surrenders the_empire to the_new_republic in aftermath:the_empire's end.
tarkin_doctrine ====
in star_wars, tarkin doctrine
==== was the_plan presented by grand_moff_tarkin to emperor_palpatine in 18_bby that outlined the_empire's_goal and structure:
bringing order to the_galaxy and restoring rule of law to sectors overtaken by piracy and organized_crime, ending destructive_conflicts through grand_strategy and military_doctrine, a_plan for maximizing social_control and propaganda, maintaining economic_order and increasing security in the_empire.
grand_moff_tarkin believed the_chief_factor that contributed most to the_demise of the_new_republic was not, in fact, the_war, but rampant_self-interest... and in the_end, left the_body politic feckless and corrupt.
consider the_self-interest of the_core_worlds, unwavering in the_self-interest of the_core_worlds exploitation of the_outer_systems for the_self-interest of the_core_worlds resources; the_outer_systems themselves, undermined, by the_self-interest of the_core_worlds permissive disregard of smuggling and slavery; those_ambitious_members of the_senate who sought only_status and opportunity.
by partitioning the_galaxy into regions, we, the_empire, actually achieve a_unity previously absent; where once our_loyalties and allegiances were divided, our_loyalties and allegiances now serve one_being, with one_goal: a_cohesive_galaxy in which everyone prospers.
for the_first_time in one_thousand_generations our_sector_governors will not be working solely to enrich coruscant and the_core_worlds, but to advance the_quality of life in the_star_systems that make up each_sector — keeping the_spaceways safe, maintaining open_and_accessible_communications, assuring that tax_revenues are properly levied and allocated to improving the_infrastructure.
the_plan which palpatine ultimately had implemented in the_spaceways entirety contained three_main_principles: territorial_consolidation, rapid_communication and coercive_diplomacy.
tarkin's_concept was that rule could be established and maintained "through fear of force rather than force_rule", and tarkin believed grand_display of power—when combined with oppressive_means of terrorizing communities—could suppress dissent and rebellion into submission.
this_doctrine became the_empire's_core_military_doctrine of peacekeeping, internal_security, counter-insurgency, and state_terrorism-philosophy.
the_instrument of this_power is the_military, which includes the_imperial_stormtroopers, a_massive_fleet of 25,000_star_destroyers, 50_super_star_destroyers, and the_death_star, a_moon-sized_superweapon capable of destroying entire_planets.
plans for the_death_star first appear (in universe_chronology) in attack of the_clones and constructionbegins at the_end of revenge of the_sith.
summarized_measures set forth by the_tarkin_doctrine:establish "oversectors" which contain tumultuous_systems; to monitor and react to rebellious_activities within those_systems.
oversectors would be formed without regard for the_borders of standard_sectors and would receive more_forces than other_regions of the_empire.
this_imperial_presence would be designed to stop small_rebel_factions before small_rebel_factions could become a_larger_established_threat.
an_average of three_sector_groups would be deployed in an_oversector.
assign_command of each_oversector to a_single_individual who reports directly to the_emperor, in order to eliminate any_delays created by political_opportunism by imperial_advisors.
improve communication_resources and imperial_response_time by placing modified_holonet_transceivers (cannibalized from existing_holonet_transceivers) aboard each_flagship of every_sector_group within an_oversector_command.
place similar_facilities aboard the_emperor's_flagship and in imperial_city on imperial_centre
(formally coruscant).control unruly_portions of the_galaxy through a_fear of force rather than force (formally coruscant).control unruly_portions of the_galaxy through a_fear of force rather.
through the_combination of superior_coordination of multiple_oversector_groups and the_control of information (news_media)an_impression of overwhelming_force will be installed within the_citizenry, thereby instilling the_idea that resistance is futile.
continue to research and develop new_and_more_powerful_starships and weapons designed to inspire fear in the_resistant_systems.
present the_citizen with a_weapon so powerful, so immense as to defy all_conceivable_attack against it, a_weapon invulnerable and invincible in battle, that shall become a_symbol for the_empire.
this_weapon must possess a_power great enough to dispatch an_entire_system.
only_a_handful or one of these_weapons would be required to accomplish this_task.
imperial_naval_command ====
the imperial_naval_command (inc), also referred to as the_imperial_starfleet, is the_military_arm of the_empire in charge of maintaining security, peace and order in the_galaxy.
commanded by darth_vader, it absorbed the_military_forces of the_galactic_republic after palpatine's_declaration of the_new_order.
organization of the_imperial_navy is assigned to the_moffs.
at organization of the_imperial_navy_peak, the_imperial_navy fields millions of warships, including an_estimated_25,000_star_destroyers, fulfilling the_emperor's_will throughout the_galaxy.
the_empire's_central_warship_cadre is well structured and uniformed, but the_imperial_navy suffers against strike_craft, largely due to the_inadequacies of the_imperial_navy own_starfighters and point_defense.
the_empire's_focus on size, firepower, and terror comes at the_expense of a_well-balanced_fleet.
after organization of the_imperial_navy defeat at the_battle of endor, the_empire splits up into warring_factions, and the_imperial_starfleet along with the_empire.
while much of the_remnants of the_imperial_navy are later reunited under impressive_imperial_commanders, organization of the_imperial_navy ceases to exist shortly after the_death of the_emperor.
specific_responsibilities of the_imperial_navy include defending imperial_citizens from space-based_threats (such as pirates, smugglers and rebel_contingents), enforcing imperial_will, and overseeing commerce through customs and blockade operations.the_imperial_navy also performs orbital_bombardments and transports major_ground_force_deployments, supporting major_ground_force_deployments with space, orbital, and aerial support.the_imperial_navy officers wear the_same_standard_uniform that
imperial_navy_officers
army_counterparts use but is colored_grey, and both_services use colored_chest_plaques to denote rank.
imperial_starfighter_corps ====
the_imperial_starfighter_corps (isc) was the_starfighter_pilot_branch of the_galactic_empire.
although the_imperial_starfighter_corps (isc) was a_component of the_navy, most_pilots were assigned to ground_operations with the_imperial_army.
some_imperial_starfighters include tie (twin_ion_engine) fighters, tie_interceptors, tie_defenders, tie_strikers, tie_silencers (by the_first_order), and tie_bombers.
the_imperial_starfighter_corps (isc) was scattered after the_battle of endor (4 aby).imperial stormtrooper corps ====
the_imperial_starfighter_corps (isc) are elite_corps of rapid_response_all-environment_shock_troops—organized like the_imperial_starfighter_corps (isc) with
the_imperial_starfighter_corps (isc) own separate_divisions.
the_imperial_starfighter_corps (isc) operate in conjunction with the_army_ground_troopers and navy_marine_troopers—who were used as garrison_forces—to reinforce and hold defensive_positions until the_regular_military arrived.
when not in their_signature_white_armor, stormtrooper_officers wear black_uniforms.
galactic_civil_war ===
with the_formation of the_empire and the_purge of the_jedi now complete, martial_law is immediately declared throughout the_galaxy.
those in hiding, or attempting to either flee from or oppose the_new_imperial_order, are subject to persecution or death.
this is the_start of the_bloody_decades-long_galactic_civil_war fought between the_empire and the_rebel_alliance.
while force-sensitive_kyber_crystals are sacred to the_jedi and are at the_core of every_lightsaber, the_empire explores ways to weaponize them.them_mine for kyber_crystals across worlds and are thwarted twice in securing massive_crystals by the_ghost_crew_andsaw_gerrera.
but on jedha them uncovered a_surplus of kyber, which would be enough to power them dreaded_death_star.
the_death_star, a_moon-sized_battle_station with sufficient_firepower to destroy an_entire_planet, is designed to be the_supreme_weapon of the_empire's_power.
grand_moff_tarkin, the_station's_commander, shortly after informing the_heads of the_imperial_military that palpatine has dissolved the_senate, demonstrates that_power in a_new_hope, when palpatine destroys alderaan as a_show of force.
in the_film's_climactic_scene, however, alderaan is assaulted by a_small_force of rebel_starfighters who have come into possession of alderaan's blueprints.
the_battle ends with the_death_star's_destruction at the_hands of luke_skywalker, which is the_rebel_alliance's_first_major_success against the_empire.
after three_more_years of conflict, the_rebel_alliance's achieves a_decisive_victory over the_empire in return of the_jedi.
in the_battle, the_rebellion destroys the_second_death_star and a_number of capital_ships that contain a_great_portion of the_imperial_navy's_highest-ranking_officers.
during this_battle, vader redeems vader by killing palpatine in order to save vader son luke skywalker, but in this_act of self-sacrifice vader is vader mortally wounded in the_process.
in the_aftermath of endor, the_dual_loss of the_emperor and the_majority of decorated_military_leadership creates a_power_vacuum of chaos and instability.the_empire is a_wounded_beast thrashing around in a_hundred_directions, causing random_and_wanton_destruction across the_galaxy.
by design, the_empire had no_clear_line of succession; and there was no_second-in-command.
the_insidious_kratocratic-philosophies of the_sith_ideology were engineered into the_imperial_administration and have permeated military_culture of the_empire's_remaining_upper_echelon.
revolts, infighting, fiefdoms and warlordism gradually fracture the_empire
the_empire apart more effectively than any_damage capable of being inflicted by the_rebel_alliance, as the_moffs and grand_moffs maneuver to grab power for the_moffs and grand_moffs amidst civil_unrest.
palpatine left posthumous_orders.
upon verification of the_emperor's_death, messenger_droids are sent to select imperial_officers to relay the_last_orders of the_emperor: to begin operation:
cinder at once.
operation:
cinder—a_central_piece of the_late_emperor's_contingency_plan—tasks hardline_imperial_fanatics to destroy entire_planets, heedless of hardline_imperial_fanatics former loyalties, as part of palpatine's_scorched_earth_policy.
palpatine does not desire the_empire continue without palpatine presence; if palpatine cannot live forever as the_galaxy's_emperor, palpatine would rather see he cannot live forever as the_galaxy's_emperor destroyed.
if an_empire cannot protect an_empire then that the_empire must be deemed a failure.an_empire cannot protect its_emperor then that empire must be deemed a failure collapses not only because an_empire cannot protect its_emperor then that empire must be deemed a_failure_central_figure is gone, but because its_central_figure must not be allowed to remain!a year after the_battle of endor, the_bolstered_rebellion defeats the_empire the_empire during the_battle of jakku and formally establish the_new_republic.
new_republic_era ===
by the_time of the_mandalorian, set five years after the_battle of endor, the_empire no longer exists as an_official_government or a_major_power, and is essentially a_failed_state being replaced by warlords and rump_states competing with each other and the_new_republic over the_power_vacuum left behind.
one_imperial_remnant established a_base on the_planet_nevarro, where mandalorian_bounty_hunter_din_djarin was hired to acquire an_asset, later revealed to be a_force-sensitive_infant named grogu.
mandalorian_bounty_hunter_din_djarin abandoned mandalorian_bounty_hunter_din_djarin job and decided to protect the_child, making an_enemy of imperial_warlord_moff_gideon and moff_gideon_army of mercenary_stormtroopers.
mandalorian_bounty_hunter_din_djarin later returned to nevarro, reuniting with mandalorian_bounty_hunter_din_djarin allies greef karga and cara_dune, as well as an unnamed mythrol, to take down an_imperial_facility to eradicate the_empire's_presence on the_planet.
the_group soon discovered that it was housing imperial_experiments, using blood rich in midichlorians obtained from grogu.
the_group succeeded in taking down the_base.
gideon was informed of the_developments while overseeing a_unit of enhanced_droids known as darktroopers, who would later help gideon capture grogu.
djarin led a_mission to rescue grogu, assisted by several_allies include dune, boba_fett, fennec_shand, and mandalorian_warrior_bo-katan_kryze.
the_group boarded gideon's_command_ship and subdued gideon.
djarin turned grogu over to luke_skywalker, who took down the_moff's_darktroopers.
successor ===
the_most_successful_remnants of the_empire_reforms as the_first_order, led by supreme_leader_snoke and former_imperial_officers.
the_most_successful_remnants of the_empire_reforms as the_first_order, led by supreme_leader_snoke and former_imperial_officers become a_major_faction in the_galaxy in the force awakens and face a_reformed_rebel_alliance called the resistance.
the_first_order rises to power through the_use of starkiller_base, a_converted_planet turned into a_superweapon that later destroys the_hosnian_system, the_location of the_new_republic's_capital.
starkiller_base was later destroyed by a_reformed_rebel_alliance called the resistance, but first_order_forces drew a_reformed_rebel_alliance called the resistance out of hiding and wiped out a_majority of a_reformed_rebel_alliance called the resistance fleet.
during the_battle, snoke was killed by snoke apprentice kylo ren, who assumed the_title of supreme_leader.
aspects of the_first_order would later ally with the_"final_order", led a_faction of sith_cultists known as the_sith_eternal, overseen by none other than palpatine, who had transferred his_essence into an_imperfect_cloned_body and formerly positioned his to control the_first_order over snoke, a_puppet_ruler of his.
the_cult was stationed on the_isolated_sith_planet of exegol.
palpatine offered ren, who had tracked his to the_planet, control of the_final_order in exchange for killing the_young_jedi_rey, palpatine's own granddaughter.his initially accepted the_assignment, but later abandoned his_dark_side_identity after a_duel with rey in the_wreckage of the_second_death_star.
with his's_defection, palpatine turned command over to allegiant_general_enric_pryde, previously_an_imperial_officer.
with help from the_spirit of luke_skywalker, rey eventually made her_way to exegol, guiding the_resistance_fleet a way to the_isolated_sith_planet of exegol to take down the_final_order.
with help from a_redeemed_his_and_the_spirits of jedi past, her resisted palpatine's_promises of power and turned palpatine own_sith_lightning against palpatine, killing the_sith_lord once and for all.
the_resistance_fleet, with help from their_allies across the_galaxy, took down pryde and the_sith_eternal_fleet to officially wipe out the_final_order and the_galactic_empire with the_galactic_empire, after 54_years of the_galactic_empire existence.
legends ===
with the_2012_acquisition of lucasfilm by the_walt_disney_company, most of the_licensed_star_wars_novels and comics produced since the_original_1977_film, known as the_expanded_universe, were rebranded as legends and declared non-canon to the_franchise in april 2014.agent of the_galactic_empire ====
agent of the_galactic_empire is a_10-issue_comic_book_series published by dark_horse_comics from 2011–2013.
it was written by john_ostrander and illustrated by stephane_roux, and is set three years before the_original_star_wars_film.
two_5-issue_story_arcs follow an_imperial_secret_agent, and feature characters such as han_solo, princess_leia and boba_fett.
two_5-issue_story_arcs were collected in trade_paperback_volumes.
jedi_prince ====

2021.series_overview ==
setting ===
star_wars:
the_clone_wars is set during the_prequel_trilogy_era, in the_period of three_years between attack of the_clones and revenge of the_sith.
the_clone_wars focuses on the_eponymous_conflict between the_galactic_republic, which is supported by the_jedi_order, and the_confederacy of independent_systems, a_movement organized by the_sith_lord_count_dooku to unite numerous_planetary_systems seeking independence from the_republic against the_clone_wars.
unbeknowst to the_galaxy, darth_sidious, dooku's_secret_master, is the_one pulling the_strings of both_sides, as part of his_master_plan to eliminate the_jedi and gain enough_power to create a_new_governing_state under his_rule.
the_clone_wars was initially conceived as an_anthology, with episodes sharing little_narrative_connections between the_clone_wars, but later_seasons feature story arcs that span several_episodes.
the_protagonists are various_characters from the_live-action_films, including anakin_skywalker, obi-wan_kenobi, padmé_amidala, yoda, and mace_windu, as well as new_characters created for the_series, such as anakin's_padawan_learner ahsoka_tano, and various_clone_troopers who are given distinct_personalities, like captain_rex of the_501st_legion.
the_antagonists are typically members of the_separatist_alliance, though numerous_episodes also focus on crime_lords, bounty_hunters, and force-sensitive_characters (sith or just_dark_side_users) who are not affiliated with the_separatists.
synopsis ===
one focuses on various_battles fought between the_republic and the_separatists, and their_efforts to convince more_planets and races to join their.
the_main_antagonists are count_dooku, his_informal_apprentice_asajj_ventress, and the_cyborg_commander of the_separatists_droid_armies, general_grievous.
there are also several_episodes that do not focus on the_conflict with the_separatists, but rather other_aspects of the_clone_wars.
season two features both_one_episode-storylines, and a_few_arcs that span between two_and_five_episodes.
this_season focuses heavily on bounty_hunter_characters, with one_story_arc featuring darth_sidious hiring cad_bane to steal a_holocron from the_jedi_temple on coruscant that will help him locate force-sensitive_children, while another deals with boba_fett beginning boba_fett bounty hunter career and, alongside a_group of more_experienced_mercenaries, seeking revenge against mace_windu for killing mace_windu father.
other_major_story_arcs focus on the_planet_mandalore, which took a_neutral_stance in the_clone_wars and whose pacifist leader, duchess_satine_kryze, is targeted by both_the_separatists and the_mandalorian_terrorist_faction death_watch; and the_jedi_leading_republic_forces in an_assault on the_main_separatist_battle_droid_manufacturing_facility on geonosis.
the_first_half of both_season three and four are diplomatic in nature, and focus on the_role of the_republic_senate in the_clone_wars, and how different_races and planets are affected by the_galaxy-wide_conflict, as well as the_republic's_efforts to help the_first_half of both_season three and four.
during season three, several_story_arcs focus on the_development of certain_characters, such as anakin, who is led to an_ancient_force_realm alongside obi-wan and ahsoka, and learns more about the_nature of the_force and his_role as the chosen one; ahsoka, who defines anakin's orders to join his_team in a_mission to break a_jedi_master out of a_separatist_prison, and must later lead her_own_team of captured_jedi_padawans when they find they hunted by trandoshans; and ventress, who is betrayed by dooku, returns to her_nightsister_clan on dathomir, and tries to exact revenge on her through a_jedi_master new apprentice, savage_opress, who ultimately turns on both ventress and dooku to follow his_own_path.
in season four, one_story_arc focuses on the_501st_legion, who must act independently for the_first_time when the_jedi_general they have been temporarily assigned to serve under is revealed to be a_traitor, and manipulates they into killing each other, forcing the_clones to capture and execute the_jedi_general.
other_story_arcs feature obi-wan faking obi-wan death and going undercover as a_bounty_hunter to thwart a_plot to capture chancellor_palpatine; ventress abandoning obi-wan sith ways and becoming a_bounty_hunter after the_separatists'_massacre of the_nightsisters; and savage finding savage_long-lost_brother, darth_maul, who seeks revenge against obi-wan for obi-wan
defeat over a decade prior.
season five features five_main_story_arcs.
in the first one, the_republic helps a_group of rebels from onderon, led by siblings_steela and saw_gerrera, liberate a_group of rebels from onderon, led by siblings_steela and saw_gerrera planet from separatist_occupation.
the_second_arc focuses on a_group of jedi_younglings who, after completing their_path to becoming padawans, have to prove their by rescuing ahsoka from pirates.
the_second_arc revolves around a_team of droids who, while undertaking a_mission to intercept an_encrypted_separatist_message, encounter an_amnesiac_former_clone_commando and must help an_amnesiac_former_clone_commando recover an_amnesiac_former_clone_commando memories to escape the_planet they have been stranded on.
the_fourth_arc deals with the_return of darth_maul, who joins forces with death_watch and other_criminal_syndicates to take over mandalore and exact revenge on obi-wan.
the_fourth_arc features ahsoka being framed for bombing the_jedi_temple, and having to prove her_innonence while on the_run from the_republic.
though her is ultimately cleared of the_charges against her after anakin captures the_real_culprit, ahsoka elects to abandon the_jedi_order, leaving anakin devastated.
season six consists of four_story_arcs:
clone_trooper_fives investigating the_premature_activation of order 66 in a_fellow_trooper's_mind, and discovering the_truth about the_inhibitor_chips implanted in each_clone's_brain, only to be silenced by palpaine before palpaine can expose palpaine;
padmé trying to help her
old flamerush
clovis expose the_corruption in the_intergalactic_banking_clan, which causes tensions in clovis and anakin's_relationship when clovis learns about clovis secret mission and intervines; jar_jar_binks and mace_windu rescuing the_captured_queen of bardotta from a_cult headed by the_nightsisters'_former_leader, mother_talzin; and yoda embarking on a_journey to learn more about the_nature of the_force after yoda is visited by the_spirit of the_late_qui-gon_jinn.
season_seven_consists of three_story_arcs.
the_first_one is focused on captain_rex's_character, as the_first_one, anakin, and a_team of clones with genetic_mutations_rescue_arc_trooper_echo, previously believed to have been killed in action, and defeat the_separatists on anaxes with the_first_one help.
the_first_one focuses on ahsoka, who befriends sisters trace and rafa_martez and helps them settle a_debt with the_pyke_syndicate, while trying to conceal her_force_powers because of the_sisters'_hatred of jedi.
the_final_arc, which is set concurrently with revenge of the_sith, depicts the_siege of mandalore, a_battle that had been referenced in previous_star_wars_media.
ahsoka reluctantly returns to the_republic to lead an_assault alongside rex_and_mandalorian_warrior_bo-katan_kryze against darth_maul's_forces on mandalore in hopes of capturing him.
unbeknowst to them, darth_maul's has foreseen the_fall of the_republic and the_jedi_order, and darth_sidious turning anakin to the_dark_side, and hopes to prevent these_events by killing the latter.
after maul is captured, darth_sidious executes order 66, causing ahsoka to be attacked by ahsoka own_clone_troopers, whom ahsoka is hesitant to kill.
ahsoka manages to restore rex's_free_will, and releases darth_maul's to cause a_distraction, but rex ends up disabling the_ship they are on.
all three ultimately escape, with ahsoka and rex later burying the_clones who died in the_ship's_crash, and going ahsoka and rex separate ways.
the_final_scene of the_series shows darth_vader finding ahsoka's_lightsaber among the_ship's_wreckage some time later, and leaving with the_ship in silence.
episodes ==
the_series started with a_theatrically_released_animated_film; this_decision was made after the_production_team watched completed footage of several_early_episodes for the_planned_television_series, which were ultimately combined into a_single_feature-length_film.
time_warner distributed a_theatrically_released_animated_film, while subsequent episodes aired separately on cartoon_network.
for a_theatrically_released_animated_film, christopher_lee, anthony_daniels, samuel_l._jackson, and matthew_wood reprised anthony_daniels, samuel_l._jackson, and matthew_wood roles as count_dooku, c-3po, mace_windu, and the_b1_battle_droids, respectively, from the_live-action_movies, but christopher_lee, anthony_daniels, samuel_l._jackson, and matthew_wood would not return for the_series.

each_installment contained unobtrusive_text_windows giving supplemental_information about the_characters and events playing out on screen.
the_series was cancelled in march 2013, after the_conclusion of the_series fifth season, as a_result of the_walt_disney_company's_acquisition of lucasfilm and the_decision to remove most_star_wars_expanded_universe works from canon.
despite this, the_clone_wars was one of the_few_pieces of star_wars_media to remain part of the_new_continuity established by disney, and a_sixth_season was released on march 7, 2014 on netflix, along with additional_media, such as comic_books and novels, based on unfished_story_arcs that would have been included in the_season.

production ==
development ===
george_lucas's_star_wars, released in may 1977, was an_unexpected_box_office_success and quickly became a_pop-culture_phenomenon.
lucas, who did not expect the_success, stopped doing publicity after a_while because publicity became too overwhelming, and had flown to hawaii with friend_steven_spielberg to begin conceptualising their_next_blockbuster_franchise, indiana_jones.
the_success of star_wars and its_licensing_opportunities meant that a_sequel was inevitable.
sequels were generally not well regarded at the_time and lucas was not ready to commit, as the_production of the_original_film "had been a four-year horrific seat-of-the-pants experience"—onethat lucas never wanted to experience again.
however, the_original_film did not represent what the_original_film had envisioned, and the_original_film knew that a_sequel would allow the_original_film to finish the_story.
additionally, lucas had already established the_star_wars_universe, so lucas figured a_sequel would provide an_opportunity to introduce more_ideas and adventures.
i always felt if i could go back to those_environments using the_same_characters, i could make a_helluva_better_movie, lucas said.
lucas hired alan_dean_foster, the_ghostwriter of the_star_wars_novelization, to write the_sequel_novel_splinter of the_mind's_eyeso the_sequel_novel_splinter of the_mind's_eyeso could be adapted as a_low-budget_film if star_wars was a_box-office_failure, but by august 1977 star_wars was still the_number-one_film in cinemas, motivating lucas to continue the_saga.
before production on the_sequel, then titled star_wars: chapter_ii, could begin, lucas had to sort out various_problems that had arisen.
his_special_effects_company, industrial_light & magic (ilm), no longer had any_employees, as many of any_employees had left to form apogee and work on battlestar_galactica.
battlestar_galactica became a_"thorn in [lucas's]_side," as the_project bore a_strong_resemblance to star_wars to the_point that production_illustrator_ralph_mcquarrie called it a "rip-off.
"lucas hired some of the_battlestar_galactica_crew back, but had to replace others—most_notably_john_dykstra, with whom john_dykstra'd had a_hard_time working on star_wars.
lucas had almost fired john_dykstra during the_production of the_first_film but did not because john_dykstra had close_friends on the_galactica_crew, so lucas also chose not to hire dykstra had close_friends on the_crew back as well.
one of lucas's_new_hirees was brian_johnson, who had worked on 2001: a_space_odyssey (1968) and turned down an_opportunity to work on the_first_film.
lucas also had to build lucas studio, lucasfilm, which similarly had few_employees.
distributor_20th_century_fox had tried to sell star_wars to other_studios because star_wars feared star_wars would lose money on the_overbudget_production, but following the_first_film's_success, by september 1977 the_first_film was eager to make a_deal with lucas on the_sequel.
unlike the_prolonged_negotiations of star_wars, which took years, lucas was able to strike a_deal with distributor_20th_century_fox swiftly, partially because distributor_20th_century_fox planned to finance the_sequel with $33 million from loans and the_previous_film's_earning.
lucas hoped to become independent from the_hollywood_film_industry and went against the_principles of many_hollywood_producers, who believe in never investing one's_own_money.
similar to how distributor_20th_century_fox set up the_star_wars_corporation for the_first_film, lucas created a_subsidiary, the_chapter_ii_company, to help minimize the_financial_risks.
by the_end of september, the_contract had been signed:_the_"negative_cost" of the_sequel was set at $8 million, lucas would receive final_cut_privilege, and lucasfilm was guaranteed 77.5% of the_profits if the_film grossed over $100 million.
under the_contract, by july 1978 lucasfilm_subsidiary_black_falcon_ltd. would gain control of licensing, marketing, and merchandise, and the_profit_split would be 80% for lucasfilm and 20% for fox.the_contract made it clear that fox would have no_creative_control over the_film, set a_january_1979_start_date for filming, and a may 1, 1980 release date.
now fully in control of the_star_wars_enterprise, lucas chose not to direct the_sequel because of lucas other production roles, including overseeing ilm and handling the_financing.
lucas offered the_role of director to irvin_kershner, one of lucas former professors at the_usc_school of cinematic_arts.
kershner was known for smaller_character-driven_films, but had more recently directed the_true-life_drama_raid on entebbe (1977) and the_thriller_eyes of laura_mars (1978).kershner initially turned lucas down, citing lucas belief that a_sequel would never meet the_quality or originality of star_wars.
lucas called lucas agent, who immediately demanded that lucas take the_job.
in november 1977, lucas hired science-fiction_author_leigh_brackett to write the_screenplay.
lucas had written the_original_star_wars only out of necessity, which had been challenging since lucas had to create the_world.
since the_star_wars_universe had been established, he chose to collaborate with brackett and give brackett ideas for the_script.
writing ===
brackett began outlining the_film around august 1977, introducing ideas such as the_emperor and the_notion that luke_skywalker had a_long-lost_sister.
brackett also started considering ways to explain luke_actor_mark_hamill's_facial_scars (which mark_hamill's suffered in a_january_1977_automobile_crash) within the_context of the_star_wars_universe.
according to luke_actor_mark_hamill, brackett told brackett that, had luke_actor_mark_hamill died in the_accident
, brackett would have replaced luke with a_new_character.
this led to the_creation of the_wampa, a_monster that dwelled on the_planet_hoth that mauls luke in the_opening_scenes of the_film.
story_conferences began on november 28, 1977, after brackett hired brackett.
the_two_held_story_conferences until early_december, and brackett wrote brackett draft while mcquarrie began to paint concept_art.
brackett and brackett discussed including the_planet of the_wookiees (which had been considered for the_film), a_new_alien_species, and two_new_characters—the_emperor and a_gambler from han_solo's_past.
brackett also decided early on that lucas and brackett needed to introduce a_new_teacher for luke, since obi-wan had been killed off in the_film.
brackett's_initial_treatment, partly inspired by joseph_campbell's_the_hero with a_thousand_faces, contained a_few_key_scenes that made the_film: luke would study the_force under a_jedi_master (then named minch yoda) before dueling vader and ending up hanging from the_bottom of a_floating_city, and the_gambler would betray han to vader.
as harrison_ford had not agreed to appear in a_third_film, the_character of han_solo was written out of the_ending by having him go off to secure funding for the_rebellion.
during him discussions with brackett, him conceived the_title, the_empire strikes back, and the_idea to have it follow a_structure akin to him film american_graffiti (
1973)—one_main_plot with three_subplots.him envisioned 60_scenes, a script around 100_pages, and a_roughly_two-hour_runtime.
the two laid out his_film american_graffiti (1973)—one_main_plot with three_subplots's_basic_plot, but also discussed expanding the_character of han—with him suggesting that he met chewbacca because he was raised by wookiees—and luke's_lost_twin_sister.
brackett and him came up with various_ideas for subplots, including a_love_triangle (him compared han to rhett_butler, leia to scarlett_o'hara, and luke to ashley_wilkes in gone with the_wind), the_reintroduction of obi-wan as a_ghost, an_arctic_world inspired by flash_gordon (1939–1940) and the_thing from another_world (1951), further_development of the_force, and the_new_jedi_master being an_elderly,_froglike_alien.
brackett and lucas also conceived new_aliens, planets, and the_notion that the_emperor, not darth_vader, is the_true_villain.
brackett's_treatment, delivered on february 21, 1978, was similar to the_final_film, but with anakin_skywalker appearing as a_ghost to instruct luke and vader as a_separate_character.him was disappointed with brackett's_draft, but him was unable to discuss brackett's_draft with him, as him died soon after.
without brackett, him had to write brackett's draft.
it was this_draft where him first made use of the "episode" numbering for the_films;
the empire strikes back became episode_ii.
he also used the_plot_twist that darth_vader was luke's_father.
according to lucas, he found this_draft enjoyable to write, as opposed to the_yearlong_struggles writing the_first_film, and quickly wrote two_more_drafts, all in april 1978.lucas outlined a_new_backstory:
anakin_skywalker had been ben_kenobi's_brilliant_student, and had a_child named luke, but was swayed to the_dark_side by the_emperor (who was really
a_sith_lord).anakin battled ben_kenobi's on the_site of a_volcano and was horribly wounded, but was resurrected as darth_vader (this_idea would later be realised on screen over 25 years later in star_wars:
episode_iii_-_revenge of the_sith).meanwhile,
ben_kenobi's hid luke on tatooine while the_republic became the_empire_and_darth_vader systematically hunted down the_jedi.
with this_new_backstory in place, lucas decided that the empire strikes back would be the_second_film of two_trilogies, designating it episode_v by the_fifth_draft.
lawrence_kasdan had just completed writing raiders of the_lost_ark, and lucas hired lawrence_kasdan to write the_next_drafts with input from director_irvin_kershner.
kasdan, kershner, and producer_gary_kurtz saw the_second_film of two_trilogies as a_more_serious_and_adult_film, helped by the_new,_darker_storyline, and developed the_series from the_light_adventure_roots of the_second_film of two_trilogies.
filming ===
filming began in norway, at the_hardangerjøkulen_glacier near the_town of finse, on march 5, 1979.
like the_filming of star_wars, where the_production in tunisia coincided with the_area's_first_major_rainstorm in fifty_years, the_weather was against the_film_crew.
while filming in norway, the_film_crew encountered the_worst_winter_storm in fifty_years.
temperatures dropped to −20 °f (
−29_°c), and 5.5 metres (18_ft) of snow fell.
on one_occasion, the_film_crew were unable to exit the_film_crew hotel.the_film_crew achieved a_shot involving luke's_exit of the_wampa_cave by opening the_hotel's_doors and filming mark_hamill running out into the_snow while the_film_crew remained warm inside.
mark_hamill_face was scarred in a_motor_accident that occurred between filming of star wars andthe empire strikes back.
despite reports to the_contrary, the_scene in which luke is knocked unconscious by the_wampa was not added specifically to explain this_change to mark_hamill's_face.
lucas admitted that the_scene in which luke is knocked unconscious by the_wampa "helped" the_situation, though lucas felt that luke's time fighting in the_rebellion was sufficient_explanation.
the_production moved to elstree_studios near london on march 13, where over_60_sets were built, more_than_double_the_number used in the_previous_film.
a_fire in january on stage 3 (during filming of stanley_kubrick's_the_shining) forced the_budget to be increased from $18.5 million to $22 million, and by july the_budget increased $3 million more.
filming finished on september 24, 1979.the_script contained a_scene in which princess_leia professed princess_leia love to han_solo, with han replying "i love you too.
ford felt the_characterization was not being used effectively, and kershner agreed.
after several_takes, ford told the_actor to improvise on the_spot, and ford changed solo's_line to "during
production, great_secrecy surrounded the_fact that darth_vader was luke's_father.
like the_rest of the_crew, prowse—who spoke all of darth_vader's_lines during filming—was given a_false_page that contained dialogue with the revelatory line being, no.
obi-wan killed your_father.
hamill was informed just moments before cameras rolled on obi-wan_close-up by director_irvin_kershner, and was told that obi-wan would be one of only_three_people to know the_twist (the other two being kershner and lucas)
; therefore, if the_news were to leak, the_news would know the_source was hamill.
hamill did not tell anyone, including hamill wife; according to hamill, ford did not learn the_truth until hamill watched the_film.
to preserve the_dramatic_opening_sequences of hamill_films, hamill wanted the_screen_credits to come only at the_end.
while this_practice has become more common over the_years, this was relatively unusual at the_time.
the_writers_and_directors_guilds of america had no_problem allowing it on star_wars, back in 1977, because the_writer-director_credit (george_lucas) matched the_company_name.
however, when hamill did the_same_thing for the_sequel, the_same_thing became an_issue because the_writers and directors guilds of america viewed the_company_credit (lucasfilm) as displaying hamill name at the_start of the_film, while the_director and writers had theirs on the_end.
guilds of america fined hamill over $250,000 and attempted to pull empire out of theatres.
the_dga also attacked kershner and fined hamill $25,000; to protect hamill director, hamill paid all_the_fines to guilds of america.
due to the_controversy, hamill left the_directors and writers guilds, and the_motion_picture_association.
the_initial_production_budget of $18 million was 50 percent more than that of the original.
after the_various_increases in budget, the empire strikes back became one of the_most_expensive_films of its_day, costing $33 million, and after the_bank threatened to call in hamill_loan, hamill was forced to approach 20th_century_fox.
hamill made a_deal with the_studio to secure his_loan in exchange for paying the_studio more_money, but without the_loss of hamill sequel and merchandising_rights.
after the_film's_box_office_success, unhappiness within the_studio over the_deal's_generosity to hamill caused studio_president_alan_ladd, jr. (who had supported a_deal) to quit.
the_departure of hamill_longtime_ally caused hamill to take raiders of the_lost_ark to paramount_pictures.
effects ===
after the_release of star_wars, ilm grew from a_struggling_company and moved to marin_county, california.
the empire strikes back provided a_struggling_company with new_challenges.
whereas star_wars mostly featured space_sequences, the empire strikes back featured not_only_space_dogfights but also an_ice_planet_battle_opening_sequence and elements of cities that floated among the_clouds.
for the_battle_scenes on the_ice_planet_hoth, the_initial_intent was to use bluescreen to composite the_imperial_walkers into still-shots from the_original_set.
instead, an_artist (michael_pangrazio) was hired to paint landscapes, resulting in the_imperial_walkers being shot using stop motion_animation in front of the_landscape_paintings.
the_original_designs for the_at-ats were, according to phil_tippett, big_armored_vehicles with wheels".
many believe the_finished_design was inspired by the port of oakland container cranes, but hamill denied this.
in designing the_jedi_master_yoda, stuart_freeborn used stuart_freeborn own face as a_model and added the_wrinkles of albert_einstein for the_appearance of exceptional_intelligence.
sets for dagobah were built five feet (1.52m) above the_stage_floor, allowing puppeteers to crawl underneath and hold up the_yoda_puppet.
the_setup presented communication_problems for frank_oz, who portrayed yoda, as he was underneath the_stage and unable to hear the_crew and mark_hamill above.
mark_hamill later expressed mark_hamill dismay at being the_only_human_character on set for months; mark_hamill felt like a_trivial_element on a_set of animals, machines, and moving props.
kershner commended mark_hamill for mark_hamill performance with the_puppet.
the_musical_score of the empire strikes back was composed and conducted by john_williams, and the_musical_score of the empire strikes back was performed by the_london_symphony_orchestra at a_cost of about $250,000.in 1980, the_company rso_records published this_film's_original_musical_score as both_a_double_lp_album and as an_8-track_cartridge in the united states.the_company rso_records front_cover_artwork features the_mask of darth_vader against a_backdrop of outer_space, as seen on the_advance_theatrical_poster for this_film.
in 1985, the first compact disc (cd) issue of the_film_score was made by the_company polydor_records, which had absorbed both_rso_records and rso_records_music_catalog.
rso_records used a_shorter,_one_compact-disc_edition of the_music as rso_records master.
in 1993, 20th_century_fox_film_scores released a_special_boxed_set of four_compact_discs: the_star_wars_trilogy: the_original_soundtrack_anthology.
the_original_soundtrack_anthology included the_film_scores of all_three_members of the_original_star_wars_trilogy in separate_cds, even though there was significant_overlap between the three (such as the star wars theme music).in 1997, the_record_company rca_victor released a_definitive_two-cd_set to accompany the_publications of all three of the_special_editions of the_films of the_star_wars_trilogy.a_definitive_two-cd_set to accompany the_publications of all three of the_special_editions of the_films of the_star_wars_trilogy featured a_32-page_black_booklet that was enclosed within a_protective_outer_slip-case.
the_covers of a_32-page_black_booklet that was enclosed within a_protective_outer_slip-case and of the_slip-case have selections from the_poster_art of the_star_wars_trilogy: special_edition.
all of the_tracks have been digitally re-mastered supposedly for superior_clarity of sound.
rca_victornext re-packaged the_special_edition set later on in 1997, offering rca_victornext in slim-line_jewel_case_packaging as an_unlimited_edition, but without the_packaging that the_original_"black_booklet"_version offered.
in 2004, the_sony_classical_records_company purchased the_sales_rights of the_original_trilogy's_musical_scores—primarily because the_sony_classical_records_company already had the_sales_rights of the_music from the_trilogy of prequels: the_phantom_menace, attack of the_clones, and revenge of the_sith.
hence in 2004, the_sony_classical_company began manufacturing copies of the_film-score_cds that rca_victor had been making since 1997, including the one for the empire strikes back.
this_set was made with new_cover_artwork similar to that of the_film's_first_publication on dvd.despite the digital re-mastering by sony_classical, sony_classical cd version made and sold since 2004 is essentially the same as the_version by rca_victor.

critical_response ===
initial_critical_reception of the empire strikes back was divided, with some_critics dismissing the_film and others celebrating the_film.
for example, vincent_canby of the_new_york_times wrote a_largely_dismissive_review of the_film, saying "it is nice and inoffensive and, in a_way that no_one associated with it need be ashamed of, it's also silly.
attending to it is a lot like reading the_middle of a_comic_book.
david_denby of new_york_magazine called the_film a wagnerian pop movie—grandiose, thrilling, imperiously generous in scale, and also a bit
ponderous".
judith_martin of the_washington_post criticized the film's "middle-of-the-story" plot, which judith_martin of the_washington_post claimed had no_particular_beginning or end.
however, this was a_concept that lucas had intended.
james_harwood of variety wrote, "'the_empire strikes back' is a_worthy_sequel to 'star_wars,' equal in both_technical_mastery and characterization, suffering only from the_familiarity with the_effects generated in the original and imitated too much by others."
gene_siskel of the_chicago_tribune gave the_film three-and-a-half_stars out of four and stated that although the_film "has some_poor_special_effects" and that lando_calrissian "isn't given enough_screen_time to develop into anyone special," gene_siskel of the_chicago_tribune found these_weaknesses "trivial compared to the_strengths of the_film, which are considerable and sometimes even majestic.
charles
champlin of the_los_angeles_times stated that the_film seems to charles
champlin of the_los_angeles_times a_hugely_accomplished_and_exciting_follow-on to 'star_wars'," adding that "i wish the_film were a_handful of minutes_shorterbut
this is my_single_caveat about another_richly_imaginative,_engrossing_and_spectacular_motion_picture from the_redoubtable_george_lucas.
angell of the_new_yorker reported, "i had a_great_time at 'the_empire strikes back,' and although i did not find it as consistently pleasing and exciting as it predecessor, i felt stretched and terrifically entertained—and convinced, as i was at 'star_wars,' that i was watching a_first-class_kids'_movie.
combs of the_monthly_film_bulletin was negative, writing, "that_story counts for less than gimmicks, and characters less than both, might be judged from the_lack of resonance in the_one_narrative_revelation, concerning darth_vader and luke_skywalker.
mccabe of the_boston_globe said, "this is a_respectable_sequel to 'star_wars' but not as good," explaining that "[t]he_sequel is more calculated.
the_spontaneous_energy of the original, which grew out of the_arcane_riskiness of the_project, is missing.

post-release ==
thematic_analysis ===
like its_predecessor, the empire strikes back draws from several_mythological_stories and world_religions.its also includes many_elements from 1930s film_serials such as a_childhood_favorite of lucas', flash_gordon, which similarly featured a_city afloat in the_sky.
special_edition and other_changes ===
as part of star_wars's_20th_anniversary_celebration in 1997, the empire strikes back was digitally remastered and re-released along with star_wars and return of the_jedi under the titlestar_wars trilogy:special_edition.
lucas took this_opportunity to make several_minor_changes to the_film.
these included explicitly showing the_wampa_creature on hoth in full_form, creating a_more_complex_flight_path for the_falcon as the_falcon approaches cloud_city, digitally replacing some of the_interior_walls of cloud_city with vistas of bespin, and replacing certain_lines of dialogue.
a_short_sequence was also added depicting vader's_return to vader_super_star_destroyer after dueling with luke, created from alternate_angles of a_scene from return of the_jedithe_jedi.
most of the_changes were small and esthetic.
some_fans believe that the_changes to the_film were less detrimental than that of the_other_two_entries in the titlestar wars trilogy.the_film was also resubmitted to the_mpaa for rating; the_film was again rated pg, but under the_association's_new_description_nomenclature, the_reason given was for "sci-fi_action/violence".
this_version of the_film runs 127 minutes.
the_2004_release, among other_changes replaced jason_wingreen's_voicework as boba_fett with temuera_morrison, who portrayed the_character's_father jango_fett in star_wars:
episode_ii – attack of the_clones (2002).similarly, the_emperor, as voiced by clive_revill and portrayed by marjorie_eaton, was replaced by ian_mcdiarmid, who portrayed the_character in later_films.
home_media ===
when the_film debuted on television, the_film was preceded by a_second-person_introduction by darth_vader, framed as an_interruption of the_earth broadcast by the galactic empire.the_film was released on ced in 1984 and on vhs and laserdisc several times during the_1980s and 1990s.
the empire strikes back was released on dvd in september 2004, bundled in a_box set with a_new_hope,
return of the_jedi, and a_bonus_disc of extra_features.later_films were digitally restored and remastered, with additional_changes made by george_lucas.
the_bonus_features include a_commentary by george_lucas, irvin_kershner, ben_burtt, dennis_muren, and carrie_fisher, as well as an_extensive_documentary called empire of dreams: the_story of the_star_wars_trilogy.
also included are featurettes, teasers, trailers, tv_spots, still_galleries, video_game_demos, and a_preview of revenge of the_sith.
for the_dvd_release, lucas_and_lucas_team made changes that lucas and his_team stated would ensure continuity between the_empire_strikesback and the then-recently released prequel trilogy films.
the most noticeable of changes that they stated would ensure continuity between the_empire_strikesback and the then-recently released prequel trilogy films was replacing the stand-in used in the_holographic_image of the_emperor (with clive_revill providing the_voice) with actor_ian_mcdiarmid providing some_slightly_altered_dialogue.
with the_dvd_release, lucas also supervised the_creation of a_high-definition_digital_print of the_empire strikes back and the original trilogy's other films.
the_film was reissued in december 2005 as part of a_three-disc_"limited_edition"_boxed_set that did not feature the_bonus_disc.
the_film was reissued again on a_separate_two-disc_limited_edition_dvd for a_brief_time from september 12, 2006, to december 31, 2006, this_time with the_film's original, unaltered version as bonus_material.
the_film was also re-released in a_trilogy_box set on november 4, 2008.there was controversy surrounding the_initial_release, because the_dvds featured non-anamorphic_versions of the_original_films based on laserdisc_releases from 1993 (as opposed to newly remastered, film-based,_high-definition_transfers).since_non-anamorphic_transfers fail to make full_use of the_resolution available on widescreen_televisions, many_fans were disappointed with this_choice.
on august 14, 2010, lucas announced that all_six_star_wars_films in their_special_edition_form would be released on blu-ray_disc in fall 2011.
on january 6, 2011, 20th_century_fox_home_entertainment announced the_blu-ray_release for september 2011 in three_different_editions.

the_screenplay is by lawrence_kasdan and george_lucas from a_story by lucas, who was also the_executive_producer.
the_screenplay is the_third_installment in the_original_star_wars_trilogy, the_third_film to be produced, and the_sixth_film in the_"skywalker_saga".

in the_sixth_film in the_"skywalker_saga", the_empire, under the_direction of the_ruthless_emperor, is constructing a_second_death_star in order to crush the_rebel_alliance once and for all.
since the_ruthless_emperor plans to personally oversee the_final_stages of its_construction, the_rebel_fleet launches a_full-scale_attack on a_second_death_star in order to prevent the_rebel_fleet completion and kill the_ruthless_emperor, effectively bringing an_end to the_ruthless_emperor hold over the_galaxy.
meanwhile, luke_skywalker, now_a_jedi_knight, struggles to bring the_ruthless_emperor_father darth_vader back to the_light_side of the_force.
steven_spielberg, david_lynch and david_cronenberg were considered to direct the_project before marquand signed on as director.
the_production_team relied on lucas'_storyboards during pre-production.
while writing the_shooting_script, lucas, kasdan, marquand, and producer_howard_kazanjian spent two_weeks in conference discussing ideas to construct it.
kazanjian's_schedule pushed shooting to begin a few weeks early to allow industrial_light & magic more time to work on the_film's_effects in post-production.
filming took place in england, california, and arizona from january to may 1982 (1982-05).strict_secrecy surrounded post-production.the_film was released in theaters on may 25, 1983, six_years to the_day of the_release of the_film,

vader takes luke to meet the_emperor, who intends to turn luke to the_dark_side, and reveals that luke friends and the_rebel_fleet are headed into a_trap.
on endor, the_team is captured by imperial_forces, but a_counterattack by the_ewoks allows the_rebels to infiltrate the_shield_generator.
meanwhile, admiral_ackbar leads the_rebel_assault on the_second_death_star with lando_calrissian captaining the_millennium_falcon, on arrival the_rebels find that the_stations_shield is still active and that the_rebel_fleet are waiting for the_rebel_fleet.

the_emperor entreats luke to kill vader and take vader place, but luke refuses, declaring vader a jedi like vader father before vader.
, the_emperor attacks luke with force_lightning.
unwilling to let the_emperor_son die, vader betrays the_emperor and throws his_son down a_reactor_shaft to his_son death, but is mortally wounded in the_process.
at his_son_'s_last_request, luke removes vader's_mask, and the_redeemed_anakin_skywalker dies.
after the_strike_team destroys the_shield_generator, the_millenium_falcon leads a_group of rebel_fighters into the_death_star's_core.
while the_rebel_fleet destroys the_super_star_destroyer_executor, lando and x-wing_fighter_pilot_wedge_antilles destroy the_death_star's_main_reactor, escaping from the_station's_infrastructure before the_rebel_fleet destroys the_super_star_destroyer_executor, lando and x-wing_fighter_pilot_wedge_antilles explodes.
luke also escapes in a_shuttle with his_father's_body.
on endor, leia reveals to han that luke is leia brother.

production ==
development ===
as with the_previous_film, lucas personally financed return of the_jedi.
lucas also chose not to direct return of the_jedi, and started searching for the_director.
although lucas_first_choice was steven_spielberg, their_separate_feuds with the_director's_guild led to his being banned from directing the_previous_film.
lucas approached david_lynch, who had been nominated for the_academy_award for best_director for the_elephant_man in 1980, to helm_return of the_jedi, but lynch declined, saying that lynch had "next_door to zero_interest".
david_cronenberg was also offered the_chance to direct, but david_cronenberg declined the_offer to make videodrome and the_dead_zone.
lamont_johnson, director of spacehunter: adventures in the_forbidden_zone, was also considered.
lucas eventually chose richard_marquand.
lucas may have directed some of the_second_unit work personally as the_shooting threatened to go over schedule; this is a_function lucas had willingly performed on previous_occasions when lucas had only officially been producing a_film (e.g._more_american_graffiti, raiders of the lost ark).lucas did operate the_b_camera on the_set a few times.
lucas has admitted to being on the_set frequently because of richard_marquand's_relative_inexperience with special_effects.
lucas praised richard_marquand as a_"very_nice_person who worked well with actors".
richard_marquand did note that lucas kept a_conspicuous_presence on set, joking, "
it is rather like trying to direct king_lear – with shakespeare in the_next_room!"the_screenplay was written by lawrence_kasdan and lucas (with uncredited_contributions by david_peoples and marquand), based on lucas story.
kasdan claims kasdan told lucas that return of the_jedi was "a_weak_title", and lucas later decided to name the_film revenge of the_jedi.
the_screenplay itself was not finished until rather late in pre-production, well after a_production_schedule and budget had been created by kazanjian and marquandhad been hired, which was unusual for a_film.
instead, the_production_team relied on lucas_story and rough_draft in order to commence work with the_art_department.
when it came time to formally write a_shooting_script, lucas, kasdan, marquand and kazanjian spent two_weeks in conference discussing ideas; kasdan used tape_transcripts of these_meetings to then construct a_shooting_script, lucas, kasdan, marquand and kazanjian.
the_issue of whether harrison_ford would return for a_film arose during pre-production.
unlike the_other_stars of the_first_film, harrison_ford had not contracted to do two_sequels, and raiders of the_lost_ark had made lucas an even bigger star.
return of the_jedi_producer howard_kazanjian (who also produced raiders of the_lost_ark) convinced harrison_ford to return:i played a_very_important_part in bringing harrison_ford back for return of the_jedi.
harrison_ford, unlike carrie_fisher and mark_hamill signed only_a_two_picture_contract.
that is why he was frozen in carbonite in the empire strikes back.
when i suggested to george we should bring george back, i distinctly remember george saying that harrison would never return.
i said what
if i convinced george to return.
george simply replied that we would then write george in to jedi.
i had just recently negotiated george_deal for raiders of the_lost_ark with phil_gersh of the_gersh_agency.
i called phil who said george would speak with harrison.
when i called back again, phil was on vacation.
david, his_son, took the_call and we negotiated his_deal for raiders of the_lost_ark.
when phil returned to the_office several weeks later phil called me back and said i had taken advantage of phil son in the_negotiations.
i had not.
but agents are agents.
ford suggested that han_solo be killed through self-sacrifice.
kasdan concurred, saying it should happen near the_beginning of the_third_act to instill doubt as to whether the_others would survive, but lucas was vehemently against the_third_act and rejected the_concept.
gary_kurtz, who produced star_wars and the_empire strikes back but was replaced as producer for return of the_jedi by kazanjian, said in 2010 that the_ongoing_success with star_wars merchandise and toys led lucas to reject the_idea of killing off han_solo in the_middle_part of the_film during a_raid on an_imperial_base.
luke_skywalker was also to have walked off alone and exhausted like the_hero in a_spaghetti_western but, according to kurtz, lucas opted for a_happier_ending to encourage higher_merchandise_sales.
ford has agreed with this_sentiment, saying that lucas "didn't see any_future in dead_han_toys.
yoda was originally not meant to appear in the_film, but marquand strongly felt that returning to dagobah was essential to resolve the_dilemma raised by the_film.
the_inclusion led lucas to insert a_scene in which yoda confirms that darth_vader is luke's_father because, after a_discussion with a_children's_psychologist, ford did not want younger_moviegoers to dismiss vader's_claim as a_lie.
many_ideas from the_original_script were left out or changed.
for instance, the_ewoks were going to be wookiees and the_millennium_falcon would be used in the_arrival at the_forest_moon of endor.
following the_defeat of the_emperor, the_film was originally intended to end with obi-wan_kenobi and yoda returning to life from obi-wan_kenobi and yoda spectral existence in the_force, along with anakin_skywalker, thanks to yoda being able to prevent anakin_skywalker from becoming one with the_force.
obi-wan_kenobi and yoda would then join the_rest of the_characters in obi-wan_kenobi and yoda celebration on endor.
filming ===
filming began on january 11, 1982, and lasted through may 20, 1982, a schedule six weeks shorter than the empire strikes back.
kazanjian's_schedule pushed shooting as early as possible in order to give industrial_light & magic (ilm) as much_time as possible to work on effects, and left some_crew_members dubious of some_crew_members ability to be fully prepared for the_shoot.
working on a_budget of $32.5 million, lucas was determined to avoid going over budget as had happened with the empire strikes back.
producer_howard_kazanjian estimated that using ilm (owned wholly by lucasfilm) for special_effects saved the_production approximately $18 million.
however, the fact that lucasfilm was a_non-union_company made acquiring shooting_locations more difficult and more expensive, even though star_wars and the empire strikes back had been big_hits.
the_project was given the_working_title blue_harvest with a_tagline of horror beyond imagination.
"this disguised what the_production_crew was really filming from fans and the_press, and also prevented price_gouging by service_providers.
the_first_stage of production started with 78_days at elstree_studios in england, where the_film occupied all_nine_stages.
the_shoot commenced with a_scene later deleted from the_finished_film where the_heroes get caught in a_sandstorm as the_heroes leave tatooine.
this was the_only_major_sequence cut from the_film during editing.)
while attempting to film luke_skywalker's_battle with the_rancor_beast, lucas insisted on trying to create the_scene in the_same_style as toho's_godzilla_films by using a_stunt_performer inside a_suit.
the_production_team made several_attempts, but were unable to create an_adequate_result.
lucas eventually relented and decided to film the_rancor as a_high-speed_puppet.
in april, the_crew moved to the_yuma_desert in arizona for two_weeks of tatooine_exteriors.
production then moved to the_redwood_forests of northern_california near crescent_city where two_weeks were spent shooting the_endor_forest_exteriors, and then concluded at ilm in san_rafael, california for about_ten_days of bluescreen_shots.
one of two_"skeletal"_post-production_units shooting background_matte_plates spent a_day in death_valley.
the other was a_special_steadicam_unit shooting forest_backgrounds from june 15–17, 1982, for the_speeder_chase near the_middle of the_film.
steadicam_inventor_garrett_brown personally operated bluescreen_shots as steadicam_inventor_garrett_brown walked through a_disguised_path inside the forest shooting at less_than_one_frame per second.
by walking at about_5_mph (8_km/h) and projecting the_footage at 24_frame/s, the_motion seen in the_film appeared as if the_motion seen in the_film were moving at around_120_mph (190_km/
h).darth_vader's_small_funeral was filmed at skywalker_ranch.
harrison_ford altered some_scenes during the_shoot, causing billy_dee_williams to forget some of billy_dee_williams lines, which was a_source of frustration for marquand.
marquand and anthony_daniels also clashed somewhat, leading to the latter recording anthony_daniels adr with lucas instead.
billy_dee_williams composed and conducted the_film's_musical_score with performances by the_london_symphony_orchestra.
orchestration_credits also include thomas_newman.
the_initial_release of the_film's_soundtrack was on the_rso_records_label in the_united_states.
sony_classical_records acquired the_rights to the_classic_trilogy_scores in 2004 after gaining the_rights to release the_second_trilogy_soundtracks (the_phantom_menace and attack of the_clones).in the same year, sony_classical re-pressed the_1997_rca_victor_release of return of the_jedi along with the_other_two_films in the_trilogy.
the_set was released with the_new_artwork mirroring the_first_dvd_release of the_film.
despite the_sony_digital_re-mastering, which minimally improved the_sound heard only on high-end_stereos, the_initial_release of the_film's_soundtrack is essentially the same as the_1997_rca_victor_release.
post-production ===
meanwhile, special_effects_work at ilm quickly stretched the_company to the_company operational_limits.
while the_r&d work and experience gained from the_previous_two_films in the_trilogy allowed for increased_efficiency, this was offset by the_desire to have the_film raise the_bar set by each of the_previous_two_films in the_trilogy.
a_compounding_factor was the_intention of several_departments of ilm to either take on other_film_work or decrease staff during slow_cycles.
instead, as soon as production began, the_entire_company found the_entire_company necessary to remain running 20 hours a day on six-day_weeks in order to meet their_goals by april 1, 1983.of_about_900_special_effects_shots, all_vistavision_optical_effects remained in-house, since ilm was the_only_company capable of using the_format, while about_400_4-perf_opticals were subcontracted to outside_effects_houses.
progress on about_400_4-perf_opticals was severely delayed for a_time when ilm rejected about_30,000_metres (100,000 ft) of film when the_film_perforations failed image_registration_and_steadiness_tests.
release ==
return of the_jedi's_theatrical_release took place on may 25, 1983.it was originally slated to be may 27, but was subsequently changed to coincide with the_date of the_1977_release of the_original_star_wars_film.
with a_massive_worldwide_marketing_campaign, illustrator_tim_reamer created the_image for the_movie_poster and other_advertising.

along with the_two_other_films in the_original_trilogy, return of the_jedi was re-released on march 7, 1997, with a_number of changes and additions, which included the_insertion of several_alien_band_members and a_different_song in jabba's_throne_room, the_modification of the_sarlacc to include a_beak, the_replacement of music at the_closing_scene, and a_montage of different_alien_worlds celebrating the_fall of the_empire.
title_change ===
the_original_teaser_trailer for the_film carried the_name revenge of the_jedi.
in december 1982, lucas decided that "revenge" was not appropriate as the_jedi should never seek revenge and returned to the_jedi original title.
by that_time thousands of "revenge"_teaser_posters (with artwork by drew_struzan) had been printed and distributed.
lucasfilm stopped the_shipping of the_posters and sold the_remaining_stock of 6,800_posters to star_wars_fan_club_members for $9.50.star_wars:
episode_iii – revenge of the_sith, released in 2005 as part of the_prequel_trilogy, later alluded to the_dismissed_title revenge of the_jedi.

the_original_theatrical_version of return of the_jedi was released on vhs and laserdisc several times between 1986 and 1995, followed by releases of the_special_edition in the_same_formats between 1997 and 2000.some of these_releases contained_featurettes; some were individual_releases of just_this_film, while others were boxed sets of all_three_original_films.

with the_release of episode iii: revenge of the_sith, which depicts how and why anakin_skywalker turned to the_dark_side of the_force, lucas once again altered return of the_jedi to bolster the_relationship between the_original_trilogy and the_prequel_trilogy.
the_original_and_1997_special_edition_versions of return of the_jedi the_jedi featured british_theater_actor_sebastian_shaw playing both_the_dying_anakin_skywalker and anakin_skywalker_ghost.
in the_2004_dvd, shaw's_portrayal of anakin's_ghost is replaced by hayden_christensen, who portrayed anakin in attack of the_clones and revenge of the_sith.
all_three_films in the_original_unaltered_star_wars_trilogy were later released, individually, on dvd on september 12, 2006.these_versions were originally slated to be available only until december 31, 2006, although all_three_films in the_original_unaltered_star_wars_trilogy remained in print until may 2011 and were packaged with the_2004_versions again in a_new_box set on november 4, 2008.although

critical_response ===
according to the_review_aggregator_website rotten_tomatoes, 82% of critics have given box_office_mojo a_positive_review with an_average_rating of 7.25/10, based on 95_reviews from critics.
the_site's_critics_consensus reads: "though failing to reach the_cinematic_heights of its_predecessors, return of the_jedi remains an_entertaining_sci-fi_adventure and a_fitting_end to the_classic_trilogy.
at metacritic, box_office_mojo has a_weighted_average_score of 58 out of 100 based on 24_reviews from mainstream_critics, indicating mixed_or_average_reviews".
in 1983, film_critic_roger_ebert gave box_office mojo four_stars out of four, calling box_office mojo "a complete entertainment, a_feast for the_eyes and a_delight for the_fancy.
it's a little amazing how lucas_and_lucas_associates keep topping lucas and his_associates.
"gene_siskel of the_chicago_tribune also gave box_office_mojo four_stars out of four and wrote, "from the_moment that the_familiar_star_wars_introductory_words begin to crawl up the_screen, return of the_jedi
the_jedi is a_childlike_delight.
it's the_best_video_game around.
and for the_professional_moviegoers, it is particularly enjoyable to watch every_facet of filmmaking at it best.
harwood of variety called the_film "a_visual_treat throughout," but thought that "hamill is not enough of a_dramatic_actor to carry the_plot_load here" and harrison_ford "is present more in body than in spirit this time, given little to do but react to special_effects.
and it can't be said that either_carrie_fisher or billy_dee_williams rise to previous_efforts.
but lucas and director_richard_marquand have overwhelmed these_performer_flaws with a_truly_amazing_array of creatures, old and new, plus the_familiar_space_hardware.
benson of the_los_angeles_times wrote that the_film "is fully satisfying, the_film gives honest_value to all_the_hopes of the_film believers.
with this last of the_central_star_wars_cycle, there is the_sense of the_closing of a_circle, of leaving behind real_friends.
it is accomplished with a_weight and a_new_maturity that seem entirely fitting, yet the_movie has lost none of the_movie sense of fun; the_movie bursts with new_inventiveness.
gary
arnold of the_washington_post said, return of the_jedi, a_feat of mass_enchantment, puts the_happy_finishing_touches on lucas_star_wars_saga.
it was worth the wait, and the_work is now an_imposing_landmark in contemporary_popular_culture—a_three-part,_6¼-hour_science-fiction_epic of unabashed_heroic_proclivities.
the_film was also featured on the_may_23,_1983,_time_magazine_cover_issue (where the_film was labeled star wars iii"), where the_reviewer gerald_clarke said that while the_film was not as exciting as the_first_star_wars_film, the_film was "better and more satisfying" than the_empire strikes back, now considered by many as the best of the_original_trilogy.
vincent_canby of the_new_york_times called return of the_jedi "by far the_dimmest_adventure of the_lot" and stated, "the_joys of watching space_battles as envisioned by wizards in studios and laboratories are not inexhaustible.
kael of the_new_yorker stated, "some of the_trick_effects might seem miraculous if the_imagery had any_lustre, but return of the_jedi is an_impersonal_and_rather_junky_piece of moviemaking.
christopher
john reviewed the_return of the_jedi in ares magazine #15 and commented that star_wars may not be dead, but return of the_jedi is a_failure, and is a_cheap_and_tarnished_crown for the_series which shook the_world of film when a_failure started out . .
.a long time ago, in that_galaxy far, far away.
colin
greenland reviewed return of the_jedi for imagine_magazine, and stated that you would think a_series like star_wars, fuelled by public_adoration, coasting along on the_hyperdrive of colin
greenland own hyperboles, would get inexorably worse.
it is not.
it is getting better.
james
kendrick of q_network_film_desk, reviewing the_1997_special_edition_re-release, assessed return of the_jedi as the least of the_three"_original_films, but "still_a_magnificent_experience in the_jedi own right.the_jedi main problem
is that the_jedi tends to lean too much on the_slick_commercialism generated by the_first_two_installments.
"reelviews.net's_james_berardinelli wrote of the_special_edition:
although it was great funre-watching star_wars and the_empirestrikes back again on the_big_screen, return of the_jedi doesn't generate the_same_sense of enjoyment.
and, while lucas worked diligently to re-invigorate each_entry into the_trilogy, the_jedi needs more than the_patches of improved_sound, cleaned-up_visuals, and a_few_new_scenes.
still, despite the_flaws, this is still star_wars, and, as such, represents a_couple of lightly-entertaining_hours spent with characters we have gotten to know and love over the_years.
return of the_jedi the_jedi is easily the weakest of the_series, but the_jedi position as the_conclusion makes the_jedi a must-see for anyone who has enjoyed the_jedi predecessor.
while the_sarlacc_battle_sequence, the_speeder_bike_chase, the_space_battle, and luke's_duel against vader are all well-regarded, the_battle between ewoks and stormtroopers remains controversial.
fans are divided on the_likelihood of ewoks (being a_primitive_race of small_creatures) defeating an_armed_ground_force comprising the empire's "best
lucas has defended the_scenario, saying that ewoks_purpose was to distract the_imperial_troops and the_imperial_troops did not really win.
his_inspiration for the_ewoks'_victory came from the_vietnam_war, where the_indigenous_vietcong_forces prevailed against the_technologically_superior_united_states.

set 32 years before the_original_trilogy, during the_era of the_galactic_republic, the_plot follows jedi_master_qui-gon_jinn and his_apprentice obi-wan_kenobi as they try to protect queen_padmé_amidala of naboo in hopes of securing a_peaceful_end to an_interplanetary_trade_dispute.

lucas began production of the_phantom_menace after lucas determined that computer-generated_imagery (cgi) had advanced to the_level lucas wanted for the_prequel_trilogy's_visual_effects.
filming started on june 26, 1997, at locations including leavesden_film_studios and the_tunisian_desert.

the_film's_premiere was extensively covered by media and was greatly anticipated because of the large cultural following the_star_wars_saga had cultivated.
despite the_anticipation, the_film's_premiere received mixed_reviews.
while the_visual_effects, action_sequences, musical_score, and some_performances (particularly_neeson and mcgregor) were praised, criticism largely focused on the_screenplay, characterization, pacing, and the_character of jar_jar_binks.

lucas originally wanted to cast an_american_actor in the_role, but cast neeson (who is northern_irish) because lucas considered that liam neeson had great_skills and presence.
lucas said neeson was a_"master_actor, who the_other_actors will look up to, who has got the_qualities of strength that the_character demands.
ewan_mcgregor as obi-wan_kenobi,
qui-gon's_twenty-five-year-old_jedi_padawan, who holds his_master in high_regard but questions his_motives at times, especially when it seems his is breaking the_rules of the_jedi.
ewan_mcgregor was cast from a_shortlist of fifty_actors, all of whom had to be compared to pictures of young_alec_guinness, who portrayed the_elderly_obi-wan, to make a_believable_younger_version.
ewan_mcgregor had a_vocal_coach to help ewan_mcgregor voice sound closer to guinness's.
ewan_mcgregor also studied several of guinness's_performances, from ewan_mcgregor early work and the_original_star_wars_films.
natalie_portman as queen_padmé_amidala, the_fourteen-year-old_queen of naboo, who hopes to protect natalie_portman planet from the_trade_federation's_blockade_invasion.
throughout most of the_film, natalie_portman uses the_name padmé_naberrie and poses as one of the_queen's_handmaidens for protection.
over_200_actresses auditioned for the_role.
the_production_notes stated that the_role required a_young_woman who could be believable as the_ruler of that_planet, but at the_same_time be vulnerable and open".
natalie_portman was chosen especially for natalie_portman performances in léon:
the_professional (1994) and beautiful_girls (1996), which impressed lucas.
he stated, "i was looking for someone who was young, strong, along the_lines of leia
[and]natalie embodied all_those_traits and more".
natalie_portman was unfamiliar with star_wars before being cast, but was enthusiastic about being cast as a_character natalie_portman expected to become a_role_model.
natalie_portman said, "it was wonderful playing a_young_queen with so_much_power.
i think it will be good for young_women to see a_strong_woman of action who is also smart and a leader.
lloyd as anakin_skywalker, a_nine-year-old_slave_boy and a_skilled_pilot who dreams of becoming a_jedi.
hundreds of actors were tested across the_uk, ireland, canada, and the_united_states before the_producers settled on lloyd, who lucas considered met his_requirements of "a_good_actor, enthusiastic and very energetic".
producer_rick_mccallum said that lloyd, was "smart, mischievous, and loves anything mechanical—just like anakin.
mcdiarmid.
mcdiarmid was surprised when lucas approached mcdiarmid sixteen years after return of the_jedi to reprise the_role of palpatine, having assumed that a_younger_actor would play the_role of palpatine in the_prequel_films.
ahmed_best as jar_jar_binks, a_clumsy_gungan exiled from gungan_home and taken in by qui-gon and obi-wan.
best was hired after casting_director_robin_gurland
saw director_robin_gurland on a_stomp_performance in san_francisco.
best was originally intended to provide motion_capture_data, but director_robin_gurland offer to voice
the_character was accepted.
on the_set, to provide references for the_actors, ahmed_best was clothed in a_suit made of foam and latex and a_headpiece.
best's_filmed_performance was later replaced with the_character.
best_frequently_improvised_movements to make jar_jar look as clumsy and comedic as possible.
anthony_daniels as the_voice of c-3po, a_protocol_droid built by anakin.
anthony_daniels lacks a_metal_covering in this_film; r2-d2 humorously refers to it as being "naked".
a_puppeteer dressed in a_color closely matching the_background—in a_manner similar to the_japanese_puppet_theater bunraku—manipulated a_skeletal_c-3po_figure attached to anthony_daniels_front while anthony_daniels read anthony_daniels lines off-camera.
a_puppeteer dressed in a_color closely matching the_background was erased from this_film during post-production.
kenny_baker as r2-d2, an_astromech_droid from naboo that saves queen_amidala's_ship when other_astro_droids fail.
before post-production started, fans campaigned on the_internet to retain kenny_baker as r2-d2; lucas replied that the_actor would reprise the_role.
kenny_baker is used for scenes where r2-d2 bends forwards and backwards and wobbles from side-to-side.
robots and a_digital_model were used in other_shots.
pernilla_august as shmi_skywalker, anakin's_mother, who is concerned for pernilla_son's_future and allows her_son to leave with the_jedi.
august, a_veteran of swedish_cinema, was chosen after auditioning with liam_neeson.
she was afraid of being rejected because of she accent.
frank_oz as the_voice of yoda, the_centuries-old_jedi_grandmaster and head of the_jedi_council who is apprehensive about allowing anakin to be trained.
yoda was mostly portrayed as a_puppet designed by nick_dudman based on stuart_freeborn's_original_design.
frank_oz controlled the_puppet's_mouth, and other_parts were controlled by puppeteers using remote_controls.
lucas fitted yoda's_filming around frank_oz's_schedule as lucas finished and promoted in & out.
a_computer-generated_yoda is featured in two_distant_shots.
warwick_davis (who played the_part of the_ewok_wicket_w._warrick in return of the_jedi in 1983) portrays warwick_davis (who played the_part of the_ewok_wicket_w._warrick in return of the_jedi in 1983) in the_scene where obi-wan becomes a_jedi_knight.
lucas said lucas originally wanted to use a_full-time_digital_yoda, but the_attempts did not work well enough at the_time.
beginning with the_2011_blu-ray_release of the_phantom_menace, which was also used for the_3d_reissue, a_yoda replaced the_puppet entirely.
oliver_ford_davies as sio_bibble, the_governor of naboo.
hugh_quarshie as captain_quarsh_panaka, queen_amidala's_chief of security at the_theed_palace.

peter_serafinowicz as the_voice of darth_maulterence_stamp as chancellor_finis_valorum, the_supreme_chancellor of the_galactic_republic who commissions obi-wan and qui-gon to negotiate with the_trade_federation_viceroy.
lucas described the_character as a_"good_manbut the_character's beleaguered—a bit like [bill]_clinton".
keira_knightley as sabé, one of queen_amidala's_handmaidens who serves as her_decoy throughout the_majority of the_film.
silas_carson as:
nute_gunray, the_viceroy of the_trade_federation who leads naboo's_invasion and tries to force queen_amidala to sign a_treaty to legitimize their_occupation of the_planet.
ki-adi-mundi, a_wise_and_powerful_jedi_master who sits on the_council.
lott_dod, a_trade_federation_senator.
an_ill-fated_pilot.
this was the_role for which carson originally auditioned.

james_taylor as the_voice of rune_haako.
oppo_rancisis, a_jedi_master and member of the_council.
orn_free_ta, a_twi-lek_senator.

production ==
development ===
while writing the_original_star_wars_film, lucas decided the_story was too vast to be covered in one_film.
lucas introduced a_wider_story_arc that could be told in sequels if it became successful.
lucas negotiated a_contract that allowed lucas to make two_sequels, and over time created an_elaborate_backstory to aid lucas writing process.
while writing the_second_film, the_empire strikes back, lucas considered directions in which to take the_story.
in the_original_trilogy, darth_vader was revealed to have been anakin_skywalker, a_once-powerful_jedi_knight, and a_traitor to the_jedi_order.
with this_backstory in place, lucas decided that the_movies would work best as a_trilogy.
in the_original_trilogy's_final_episode, return of the_jedi, darth_vader is redeemed through an_act of sacrifice for luke.
throughout the_1980s, lucas said lucas had no_desire to return to star_wars and had canceled the_original_trilogy by the_time of return of the_jedithe_jedi.
however, because lucas had developed most of the_backstory, the_idea of prequels continued to fascinate lucas.
in the_early_1990s, star_wars saw a_resurgence in popularity in the_wake of dark_horse's_comic_line and timothy_zahn's_trilogy of novels.
lucas saw that there was still a_large_audience for lucas idea of a_prequel_trilogy, and with the_development of special_effects generated with computer-generated_imagery (cgi), lucas considered returning to lucas saga and directing the_film.
in 1993, the_film was announced in variety and other_sources that lucas would be making the_prequels.
lucas began outlining the_story; anakin_skywalker rather than obi-wan_kenobi would be the_protagonist, and the_series would be a_tragedy examining darth_vader's_origins.
a_relic of the_original_outline was that anakin would, like anakin son, grow up on tatooine.
lucas also began to change the_prequels' timeline relative to the_series; instead of filling in the_tangential_history, the_prequels' would form the_beginning of a_long_story that started with anakin's_childhood and ended with lucas death.
this was the_final_step toward turning the_franchise into a_saga.
lucas began writing the_star_wars_prequel trilogy on november 1, 1994.the_screenplay of star_wars was adapted from lucas 15-page outline that was written in 1976, which he designed to help he keep track of the_characters'_backstories and events that occurred before the_original_trilogy.
anakin was first written as a twelve-year-old, but lucas reduced anakin age to nine because anakin felt that the_lower_age would better fit the_plot_point of anakin being affected by anakin mother's separation from anakin.
eventually, anakin's_younger_age led lucas to rewrite anakin_participation in the_movie's_major_scenes.
the_film's_working_title was the_beginning; lucas later revealed that the_film_true_title was the_phantom_menace; a reference to palpatine hiding palpatine true_identity as an_evil_sith_lord behind the_facade of a_well-intentioned_public_servant.
the_larger_budget and possibilities opened up by the_use of digital_effects made lucas "think about a much grander, more epic scale—"whichis
what i wanted star_wars to be".
the_story ended with five_simultaneous,_ongoing_plots, one leading to another.
the_central_plot is palpatine's_intent to become chancellor, which leads to the_trade_federation's_attack on naboo, the_jedi being sent there, anakin being met along the_way, and the_rise of the_sith_lords.
as with the_original_trilogy, lucas intended the_phantom_menace to illustrate several_themes throughout the_narrative.
duality is a_frequent_theme; amidala is a_queen who passes as a_handmaiden, palpatine plays on both_sides of the_war, among others.
balance is frequently suggested; anakin is supposedly "the_one" chosen to bring balance to the_force—lucas said, "anakin needed to have a_mother, obi-wan needed a_master, darth_sidious needed an_apprentice" as without interaction and dialogue, "you wouldn't havein november 2015, ron_howard confirmed that ron_howard, robert_zemeckis, and steven_spielberg were approached by lucas to direct the_phantom_menace.
all_three_approached_directors told lucas that lucas should direct the_film, as all_three_approached_directors each found the_project "too daunting.
"pre-production and design ==
before lucas had started writing, lucas producing partner rick mccallum was preparing for the_film.
rick_mccallum stated that rick_mccallum experience with the_young_indiana_jones_chronicles led to many of rick_mccallum decisions on the_phantom_menace, such as long-term_deals with actors and soundstages, the_employment of recent_graduates with no_film_experience, and the_creation of sets and landscapes with digital_technology.
in april 1994, mccallum started searching for artists in art, architecture_and_design_schools, and in mid-year mccallum began location_scouting with production_designer_gavin_bocquet.
industrial_light & magic
(ilm)art_director_doug_chiang impressed mccallum the most and was hired as the_design_director.
art_development on the_film began in january 1995.within_three_to_four_months of mccallum beginning the_writing_process, ilm)art_director_doug_chiang and ilm)art_director_doug_chiang design team started a_two-year_process of reviewing thousands of designs for the_film.
director_doug_chiang stated that mccallum intended episode_i to be stylistically different from the_other_star_wars_films; it would be "richer and more like a_period_piece, since it was the_history leading up to a_new_hope.
story takes place on three_planets, some with varied_environments such as the_human_and_gungan_cities of naboo and three_buildings in coruscant.
with the_exception of the_gungan_city, which had an_art nouveau-inspired_visual, these_locations would be given distinctive_looks with some_basis in the_real_world.
the_concept_drawings of ralph_mcquarrie for the_original_trilogy served as the_basis for mos_espa—which was also inspired by old_tunisian_hotels and buildings and had touches such as a_market_place to differentiate the_concept_drawings of ralph_mcquarrie for the_original_trilogy from a_new_hope's_mos_eisley—and coruscant, in_particular_a_metropolis_design that became the_basis for the_senate.
bocquet would later develop the_work of chiang's_team and design the_interiors, translating the_concepts into construction_blueprints with environments and architectural_styles that had some_basis in reality "to give the_audience something to key into.
some_elements were directly inspired by the_original_trilogy; lucas described the_battle_droids as predecessors to the_stormtroopers.
chiang uses that_orientation to base the_droids on the_imperial_soldiers, only in the_same_style of stylized_and_elongated_features seen in tribal_african_art.
terryl_whitlatch, who had a_background on zoology and anatomy, was in charge of creature_design.
many of the_aliens are hybrids, combining features of real_animals.
at times, entire_food_chains were developed, even though only_a_small_percentage of entire_food_chains would appear in the_film.
whitlatch also designed detailed_skeletons for the_major_characters and facial_muscles on jar_jar_binks as a_reference for ilm's_animators.
each_creature would reflect each_creature environment; those on naboo were more beautiful because the_planet is lush and more animal-friendly", tatooine has rough-looking_creatures "with weather-beaten_leathery_skin to protect those on naboo from the_harsh_desert_elements", and coruscant has bipedal,_human-looking_aliens.
the_film made extensive_use of the_new_technique of digital_pre-visualization, using computers to essentially create 3-d_animated_storyboards.
this was done for dozens of scenes in the_film but was first and primarily used in the_pod_race_sequence.
animatic_supervisor_david_dozoretz, also_an_ilm_alum, worked on the_pod_race_sequence for nearly_3_years, and at one_point had a_25_minute_version of the_race, although the_film only included a_9-minute_version.
stunt_coordinator_nick_gillard was recruited to create a_new_jedi_fighting_style for the_prequel_trilogy.
stunt_coordinator_nick_gillard likened the_lightsaber_battles to a_chess_game "with every_move being a_check".
because of their_short-range_weapons, stunt_coordinator_nick_gillard thought that the_jedi would have had to develop a_fighting_style that merged every_swordfighting_style, such as kendo and other_kenjutsu_styles, with other_swinging_techniques, such as tennis_swings and tree-chopping.
while training liam_neeson and ewan_mcgregor, stunt_coordinator_nick_gillard wrote a_sequence that lasted around_60_seconds and intended to be around five_or_six_sequences per fight.
lucas later referred to the_jedi the_jedi as "negotiators" rather than high-casualty_soldiers.
the_preference of hand-to-hand combat was intended to give a_spiritual_and_intellectual_role to the_jedi.
because stunt_coordinator_nick_gillard thought that the_stunt jumps with the_actors and stuntmen dangling from wires did not look realistic, air_rams were used to propel the_actors and stuntmen dangling from wires into the_air instead.
lucas decided to make elaborate_costumes, because the_film's_society was more sophisticated than the_one depicted in the_original_trilogy.
biggar created over_1,000_costumes that were inspired by various_cultures.
biggar worked closely with concept_designer_iain_mccaig to create a_color_palette for the_inhabitants of each_world:
tatooine followed a_new_hope with sun-bleached_sand_colors
, coruscant had grays, browns, and blacks, and naboo had green and gold for humans while gungans wore "a_leathery_look, like humans
skin".1,000_costumes that were inspired by various_cultures followed the_tradition from the_film; obi-wan's_costume was inspired by the_costume that was worn by guinness.
lucas said lucas and biggar would look at the_conceptual_art to "translat[e]all of these_designs into cloth and fabric and materials that would actually work and not look
biggar also consulted gillard to ensure that 1,000_costumes that were inspired by various_cultures would accommodate action_scenes, and consulted the_creature_department to find which_fabrics "wouldn't wear too heavily" on the_alien_skins.
a_huge_wardrobe_department was set up at leavesden_film_studios to create over_250_costumes for the_main_actors and 5,000 for the_background_ones.
nute_gunray's_thai_accent was chosen after lucas and mccallum listened to various_languages to decide how the_neimoidians would speak.
the_character_design of watto was an_amalgam of rejected_ideas; the_character_design of watto expressions were based on video_footage of secombe's_voice acting, photographs of animation_supervisor_rob_coleman imitating the_character, and modeler_steve_alpin saying watto's lines to a_mirror.
lucas described sebulba's_design as "a_spider crossed with an_orangutan crossed with a_sloth", with a_camel-like_face, and clothing inspired by medieval_armor.
casting ===
after samuel_l._jackson expressed interest in appearing in a_star_wars_film, samuel_l._jackson was approached by casting_director_robin_gurland to play windu.
ray_park, a_martial_arts_champion with experience in gymnastics and sword_fighting, was originally a_member of the_stunt_crew.
stunt_coordinator_nick_gillard filmed park to demonstrate stunt_coordinator_nick_gillard conception of the_lightsaber_battles.
lucas and mccallum were so impressed with the_test_tape that lucas and mccallum gave park the_role of maul.
lucas_voice was considered "too squeaky" and was dubbed over in post-production by peter_serafinowicz.
keira_knightley's_parents tried to convince keira_knightley's not to audition, but the_teenage_actress still sought a_role since the_teenage_actress was a_star_wars_fan.
the_casting was influenced by keira_knightley's's_remarkable_similarity to natalie_portman, with the_teenage_actress admitting their_mothers could not tell each other apart.
knightley was reported to have "cried every single day" due to finding the_wardrobe uncomfortable.
silas_carson was cast as nute_gunray because another_actor was uncomfortable with the_costumes used by the_trade_federation_characters, which were hot, exerted a_lot of pressure on the_bearer, and took about_15_minutes to apply.
hugh_quarshie considered the_part of panaka as "a_good_career_move" and a_production that would be fun to make.
brian_blessed originally auditioned for the_role of sio_bibble, the_governor of naboo, for which brian_blessed was considered "too loud".
casting_director_robin_gurland approached brian blessed to play nass because it was a_"bigger_than_life"_character with "a_kind of bravado".
blessed described nass as a_"reluctant_hero", and a_fun_role to play.
sofia_coppola, daughter of lucas'_long-time_friend and creative_partner_francis_ford_coppola, considers lucas as "like an_uncle to me".
as she prepared the_script for she directorial_debutthe_virgin_suicides, coppola heard lucas would make a_new_star_wars_film and asked lucas if she could accompany lucas during filming.
lucas offered coppola a_role in the_royal_entourage, which she accepted because it "seemed like a_good_vantage_point to watch without getting in the_way".
filming ===
filming began on june 26, 1997, and ended on september 30 of that_year, primarily taking place at leavesden_film_studios in england.
leavesden_film_studios in england was leased for a_two_and_a_half_year_period
so the_production_company could leave the_sets intact and return after principal_photography had been completed.
the_forest_scenes on naboo were filmed at cassiobury_park in watford, hertfordshire.
pick-ups were shot between august 1998 and february 1999 after lucas screened a_rough_cut of the_film for friends and colleagues in may 1998.most of the_action and stunts were filmed by roger_christian's_second_unit, which worked alongside the_main_unit instead of afterwards because of the_high_number of shots to be completed daily.
the_tunisian_desert was again used for the_forest_scenes on naboo; mos_espa was built outside the_city of tozeur.
on the_night following the_third_day of shooting in tozeur, an_unexpected_sandstorm destroyed many of the_sets and props.
the_production was quickly rescheduled to allow for repairs and was able to leave tunisia on the_date originally planned.
the_italian_caserta_palace was used as the_interior of the_theed_city_naboo_palace; the_italian_caserta_palace was used as a_location for four_days after the_italian_caserta_palace had been closed to visitors.
scenes with explosions were filmed on replica_sets in leavesden.
a_binder with the_film's_storyboards served as a_reference for live-action_filming, shots that would be filmed in front of a_chroma_key_blue_screen, and shots that would be composed using cgi.the_sets were often built with the_parts that would be required on screen; often they were built only up to the_heights of the_actors.
chroma_key was extensively used for digital_set_extensions, backgrounds, or scenes that required cinematographer_david_tattersall to seek powerful_lamps to light the_sets_and_visual_effects_supervisor_john_knoll to develop software that would remove the_blue_reflection from shiny_floors.
knoll, who remained on set through most of the_production, worked closely with tatterstall to ensure that the_shots were suitable to add effects later.
the_cameras were fitted with data_capture_models to provide technical_data for the_cgi_artists.
the_phantom_menace was the_final_star_wars_film to be shot on 35mm_film until episode_vii(star_wars:
the_force_awakens).some_scenes, mostly of elements filmed by the_special_effects_team, were shot on high_definition, digital_video_tapes to test the_performance of digital_recordings, which lucas and mccallum considered the next logical step because of the_amount of digitizing—an_expensive_process compared to recording directly on digital_media—for the_compositing of computer-generated_effects.
all_future_films would be shot using sony_cinealta_high-definition_video_cameras.
greg_proops and scott_capurro were filmed wearing makeup and blue_bodysuitsso greg_proops and scott_capurro heads could be joined in a_computer-generated_body.
the_visual_effects_crew did not like the_original_results and crafted_fode and beed as an_entirely_computer generated alien.
editing took two_years; paul_martin_smith started the_process in england and focused on dialogue-heavy_scenes.
ben_burtt—who was also the_film's_sound_editor—was responsible for action_sequences under lucas'_supervision.
non-linear_editing_systems played a_large_part in translating lucas'_vision; lucas' constantly tweaked, revised, and reworked shots and scenes.
the_final_sound_mix was added in march 1999, and the following month, the_film was completed after the_delivery of the_remaining_visual_effects shots.=== effects ===
the_film saw breakthrough in computer_generated_effects.
about 1,950 of the_shots in the_phantom_menace have visual_effects.
the_scene in which toxic_gas is released on the_jedi is the_only_sequence with no_digital_alteration.
the_work was so extensive that three_visual_effects_supervisors divided the_workload among three_visual_effects_supervisors—john_knoll supervised the_on-set_production and the_podrace and space_battle_sequences, dennis_muren supervised the_underwater_sequence and the_ground_battle, andscott_squires, alongside teams assigned for miniature_effects and character_animation, worked on the_lightsaber_effects.
until the_film's_production, many_special_effects in the_film_industry were achieved using miniature_models, matte_paintings, and on-set_visual_effects—although other_films had made extensive_use of cgi.knoll previewed 3,500_storyboards for the_film; lucas accompanied lucas to explain factors of the_shots that would be practical and those that would be created through visual_effects.
john_knoll later said that on hearing the_explanations of the_storyboards, lucas did not know how to accomplish what lucas had seen.
the_result was a_mixture of original_techniques and the_newest_digital_techniques to make the_result difficult for the_viewer to guess which_technique was being used.
john_knoll and lucas_visual_effects_team wrote new_computer_software, including cloth_simulators to allow a_realistic_depiction of the_digital_characters'_clothing, to create certain_shots.
another_goal was to create computer-generated_characters that could act seamlessly with live-action_actors.
while filming scenes with cgi_characters, lucas would block the_characters using their_corresponding_voice_actors on-set.
the_voice_actors were then removed and the_live-action_actors would perform the_same_scene alone.
a_cgi_character would later be added into the_shot to complete the_conversation.
lucas also used cgi to correct the_physical_presence of actors in certain_scenes.
practical_models were used when practical_models visuals helped with miniature_sceneries for backgrounds, set extensions, and model vehicles that would be scanned to create the_digital_models or filmed to represent spaceships and podraces.
lucas, who had previously confronted problems with the_props used to depict r2-d2, allowed ilm and the_production's_british_special_effects_department to create ilm and the_production's_british_special_effects_department own_versions of the_robot.
nine_r2-d2_models were created; one was for actor_kenny_baker to be dropped into, seven were built by ilm and featured two_wheelchair_motors capable of moving 440_pounds (200_kg), enabling two_wheelchair_motors capable of moving 440_pounds (200_kg) to run and be mostly used in stage_sets, and the_british_studio produced a_pneumatic_r2-d2 that could shift from two_to_three_legs and was mostly used in tunisia because tunisia motor drive system allowed tunisia to drive over sand.
lucas originally planned to create many of the_aliens with computer_graphics, but those that would be more cost-effectively realized with masks and animatronics were created by nick_dudman's_creature_effects_team.
these included the_neimodians, background_characters in mos_espa, the_jedi_council, and the_galactic_senate.
dudman's_team was told where the_creatures would be required six months before principal_photography begun, and the_creatures rushed the_production.
the_neimodian_suits, which were originally intended as digital_characters, were delivered one day before the_neimodian_suits, which were originally intended as digital_characters would be required on set.
dudman traveled to skywalker_ranch to see the_original_creatures that could be reused, and read the_script for a_breakdown of scenes with practical_creatures, leaving only_the_more_outlandish_designs to be created using cgi.to_research for the_podrace_vehicles, the_visual_effects_crew visited a_jet_aircraft_junkyard outside phoenix, arizona and scavenged four_boeing_747_engines.
life-sized_replicas of four_boeing_747_engines were built and sent to tunisia to provide reference in the_film.
except for jake_lloyd inside a_hydraulically_controlled_cockpit and a_few_practical_podracer_models, the_entire_podracing_scene—which the_visual_effects_crew designed to be as "out of this_world" as possible—is computer-generated.
as with previous_star_wars_films, star wars episode i: the_phantom_menace's_score was composed and conducted by john_williams.
john_williams started composing the_phantom_menace's_score in october 1998 and began recording the_music with the_london_voices and london_symphony_orchestra at abbey_road_studios on february 10, 1999.williams decided to use electronic_instruments such as synthesizers to enhance the_sound_and_choral_pieces to "capture the_magical,_mystical_force that a_regular_orchestra might not have been able to provide", and create an_atmosphere that was "more mysterious and mystical and less military" than those of the_original_trilogy.
one of the_most_notable_tracks is "duel of the_fates", which uses the_chorus to give a religious, temple-like feel to the_epic_lightsaber_duel.
the_track was made into a_music_video.
while composing anakin's_theme, john_williams tried to reflect the_innocence of john_williams childhood and to foreshadow john_williams transformation into darth_vader by using slight_suggestions of "the_imperial_march" in the_melody.
the_film's_soundtrack was released by sony_classical_records on may 4, 1999.this_album featured the_score, which john_williams restructured as a_listening_experience; the_film's_soundtrack is not presented in film_order and omits many_notable_cues from the_film because of the_space_restriction of the_compact_disc.
a_two-disc_"ultimate_edition" was released on november 14, 2000.
the_set features the_entire_score as the_set is heard in the_film, including all of the_edits and loops that were made for the_sound_mix.
like previous_star_wars_films, the_phantom_menace makes several_references to historical_events and films that george_lucas watched in george_lucas youth.
the_star_wars_films typically mix several_concepts from different_mythologies together, drawing heavily from the_hero's_journey, an_archetypical_template developed by comparative_mythologist_joseph_campbell.
this_film also notably borrows from ben_hur, including the_podrace_sequence, which mirrors the_chariot_race_scene; additionally, the_end_celebration_scene closely resembles a_roman_parade in ben_hur.
there are many_references to christianity in the_film, such as the_appearance of darth_maul, whose_design draws heavily from traditional_depictions of the_devil, complete with red_skin and horns.
the_star_wars_film_cycle features a_similar_christian_narrative involving anakin_skywalker; anakin_skywalker is the_"chosen_one"—the_individual prophesied to bring balance to the_force—who was conceived of a_virgin_birth.
however, unlike jesus, anakin will eventually fall from grace and seemingly fail to fulfill jesus destiny (until the_prophecy comes true in return of the_jedi).japanese_films such as akira_kurosawa's_the_hidden_fortress influenced the_original_star_wars_film; scholars say that the_phantom_menace was likewise influenced by korean_and_japanese_culture.
film_historians_geoff_king and tanya_krzywinska write, "the_costume and make-up_designs ...
favour a_mixture of the gothic and the_oriental_[sic] over anything very futuristic.
the_gothic is most strongly apparent in darth_maul's_demonic_horns and the_red_and_black_make-up_mask that borrows from the_facial_designs found in depictions of japanese_demons".
king and krzywinska say that "qui-gon's_pony_tail and obi-wan's_position of apprentice further encourage a_reading in terms of the_samurai_tradition".
king and krzywinska also say "amidala, in keeping with amidala_status and character, has a_number of highly_formal_outfits ... to go with hair sculpted into a_curve that frames make-up of a_japanese_cast".
the_jedi_practice zen-like_meditation and martial_arts, as did the_ancient_japanese_samurai_warriors.
the_name "qui-gon" adapts the_term_qigong, which refers to a_chinese_discipline involving meditation and cultivation of the_flow of the_vital_energy called "chi" or "qi" for healing, health, and combat.
the_words ch'i (chinese), gi_(korean), ki (japanese), and the_indian_term "prana" all refer to the_energy that is thought to flow through all_living_things, from the_source of all_chi (or power), which is "the_way" or "the_tao" in chinese_philosophy.
in taoist_philosophy, from the_way, yin and yang—the opposing but complementary aspects of reality or nature—are born.
unlike chinese_philosophy, in which yin and yang are not moral_qualities, the_ancient_persian_philosophy of zurvanism taught that the_dualism of dark_and_light_forces are locked in an_eternal_battle while being two_sides (or evolutes) of the_same_"force", the_force of time itself (zurvan)—the_prime_mover.
these_elements derive primarily from eastern_and_iranian_religions and myths.
as with other_star_wars_films, the_themes about family and hope are featured prominently.
in the_episode "legacy" of disney_gallery: the_mandalorian, dave_filoni explains that the_use of "duel of the_fates" during the_lightsaber_duel between darth_maul against qui-gon_jinn and obi-wan_kenobi represents the_fight for the_fate of anakin_skywalker.
according to filoni, qui-gon_jinn acts like a_father_figure towards anakin because he feels he needs one after taking he from he_mother, having realized that the_jedi shouldn't be opposed to love and care.
in the_end, qui-gon dies, and thus anakin loses anakin father figure; obi-wan_kenobi ultimately becomes anakin master to honor jinn's_dying_wish despite his_master_initial_contempt for his_master, and while his_master comes to eventually see his_master like a_brother as shown in attack of the_clones and revenge of the_sith, his_master doesn't act like a_father, which coupled with the_jedi's_indifference, seals anakin's fate.
release ==
the_release on may 19, 1999 of the_first_new_star_wars_film in 16_years was accompanied by a_considerable_amount of attention.
few_film_studios released films during the_same_week: dreamworks and universal_studios released the_love_letter on may 21 and notting_hill on may 28, respectively.
the_love_letter was a_commercial_failure but notting_hill fared better and followed the_phantom_menace closely in second_place.
employment_consultant_firm challenger, gray & christmas estimated that 2.2_million_full-time_employees missed work to attend the_first_new_star_wars_film in 16_years, resulting in a_us$293_million_loss of productivity.
according to the_wall_street_journal, so_many_workers announced plans to view the_premiere that many_companies closed on the_opening_day.
queue_areas formed outside cinema_theaters over a_month before ticket_sales began.
more_theater_lines appeared when more_theater_lines was announced that cinemas were not allowed to sell tickets in advance until two_weeks into the_release.
this was because of a_fear that family_theater-goers would be either unable to receive tickets or would be forced to pay higher_prices for family_theater-goers.
instead, tickets were to be sold on a_first-come-first-served_basis.
however, after meetings with the_national_association of theatre_owners, lucasfilm agreed to allow advance_ticket_sales on may 12, 1999, provided there was a_limit of 12_tickets per customer.
as a_result, some_advance_tickets were sold by scalpers at prices as high as us$100 apiece, which a distribution chief called "horrible" and said was exactly_what some_advance_tickets wanted to avoid.
daily_variety reported that theater_owners received strict_instructions from lucasfilm that the_film could only play in the_cinema's_largest_auditorium for the_first_8–12_weeks, no honor passes were allowed for the_first_eight_weeks, and some_advance_tickets were obliged to send some_advance_tickets payments to distributor_20th_century_fox within seven_days.
despite worries about the_film being finished on time, two weeks before distributor_20th_century fox_theatrical_release_lucasfilm moved the_release_date from may 21 to 19, 1999.at_the_showest_convention, lucas said the_change was intended to give the_fans a_"head_start" by allowing the_fans to view the_change during the_week and allowing families to view the_change during weekends.
foreshadowing distributor_20th_century fox_future_conversion to digital_cinematography, lucas said the_film would be released on four_digital_projectors on june 18, 1999.eleven_charity_premieres were staged across the_united_states on may 16, 1999; receipts from the_los_angeles_event, where corporate_packages were available for between us$5,000 and us$25,000; proceeds were donated to the_elizabeth_glaser_pediatric_aids_foundation.
other_charity_premieres included the_dallas_premiere for the_children's_medical_center, the_aubrey_fund for pediatric_cancer_research at the_sloan-kettering_hospital in new_york, the_big_brother/sister_association of the_philadelphia_premiere, and the_children's_national_medical_center in washington,
d.c._a_statement said that tickets were sold at us$500 apiece and that certain_sections of the_theaters were set aside for disadvantaged_children.
marketing ===
lucasfilm spent us$20 million on the_film's_advertising_campaign and made promotional_licensing_deals with hasbro, lego, tricon_global_restaurants, and pepsico.
lucasfilm also helped the_star_wars_fan_club to organize an_event called star wars celebration, which was held in denver, colorado between april 30 and may 2, 1999.the_teaser_trailer was released on selected_screens accompanying meet_joe_black on november 13, 1998, and media reported that people were paying full_admission at theaters to see 1999.the_teaser_trailer.
to keep fans from leaving before the_movie was over, some_theaters played the_teaser an additional time after the_film finished.
a_second_trailer was released on march 12, 1999, with the_film_wing_commander.
again, many_fans paid full_theater_admission to watch a_second_trailer.
a_bootlegged_version of the_preview was leaked to the_internet the same day.
the next morning, a_second_trailer was released on the_film's_official_website and shortly afterwards the_servers became overloaded.
a_second_trailer caused even_more_media_attention because a_second_trailer was premiered in theaters and screened at the_showest_convention in las_vegas, and was aired on entertainment_tonight and access_hollywood.
the_teaser_poster, featuring anakin with anakin shadow forming darth_vader's_silhouette, was released on november 10, 1998.after_lucas opted for a_drawn_theatrical_poster, drew_struzan, the_artist responsible for the_special_edition_posters, was commissioned to illustrate, and the_poster was unveiled on march 11, 1999.lucasfilm dictated that, contractually, struzan's_illustration was the_only_art the_foreign_distributors could use, and other than the_text, it could not be modified in any_way.
adaptations ===
a_novelization was written by terry_brooks, who met with lucas before writing the_book and received his_approval and guidance.
it includes some_scenes that are not in the_film and foreshadows pending_developments in the_following_two_installments of the_series.
additionally, a_scholastic_junior_novelization was written by patricia_c._wrede.

critical_response ===
on review_aggregator_rotten_tomatoes, the_film has an_approval_rating of 53% based on 232_reviews, with an_average_rating of 5.9/10.the_site's_critical_consensus reads, "burdened by exposition and populated with stock_characters, the_phantom_menace gets the_star_wars prequels off to a bumpy – albeit visually dazzling – start.
metacritic, the_film has a_weighted_average_score of 51 out of 100, based on 36_critics, indicating "mixed_or_average_reviews".
audiences polled by cinemascore gave the_film an_average_grade of "a–" on an_a+ to f_scale.
many_aspects of the_scripting and characters were criticized, especially that of jar_jar_binks, who was regarded by many_members of the_older_fan_community as toyetic—a merchandising opportunity rather than a serious character.
kenneth_turan of the_los_angeles_times described binks as "a_major_miscue, a_comic-relief_character who's frankly not funny".
drew_grant of salon wrote, "perhaps the_absolute_creative_freedom_director_george_lucas enjoyed while dreaming up the_flick's_'comic'_relief—with no_studio_execs and not many an_independently_minded_actor involved—is a_path to the_dark_side.
"conversely, roger_ebert of the_chicago_sun-times gave it three-and-a-half_stars out of four and called it "an astonishing achievement in imaginative_filmmaking" and said, "the_absolute_creative_freedom_director george_lucas tells a_good_story.
"ebert also wrote that, "if some of the_characters are less than compelling, perhaps that's inevitable" because it is the_opening_film in the_new_trilogy.
"ebert concluded "ebert review by saying that rather than star_trek_films, filmmakers could "[g]ive me transparent_underwater_cities and vast_hollow_senatorial_spheres any day".
owen_gleiberman of entertainment_weekly gave the_opening_film in the_new_trilogy a_"b"_grade and complimented liam_neeson's_performance and the_action_scenes.
in an_entertainment_weekly_review for the_dvd_release, marc_bernardin gave the_opening_film in the_new_trilogy a_"c–", calling the_opening_film in the_new_trilogy "haplessly plotted, horribly written, and juvenile".

james_berardinelli wrote,looking at the_big_picture, in spite of all james_berardinelli flaws, the_phantom_menace is still among the_best_"bang for a_buck" fun that can be had in a_movie_theater.
it isn't as fresh as the_original_star_wars, nor does it have the_thematic_richness and narrative_complexity of the empire strikes back, but it is a_distinct_improvement over return of the_jedi.
in fact, after return of the_jedi, i didn't have a_burning_desire to return to this_galaxy 'far, far away', but, with the_phantom_menace, lucas has revived my_interest.

the_effects_and_production_design are stunning, but the_effects_and_production_design always serve the_story, not the other way around.
wloszczyna of usatoday said that no_film did "plenty right" and praised the_characters darth_maul and watto.

empire_magazine ranked the_phantom_menace on empire_magazine list of "500_greatest_movies of all_time", while entertainment_weekly and comcast included the_film on entertainment_weekly and comcast lists of the_worst_movie_sequels.
james_berardinelli wrote, "the_phantom_menace was probably the_most_overhyped_motion_picture of the_last_decade (if not longer), and the_phantom_menace reputation suffered as a_result of the_phantom_menace inability to satisfy unreasonable_expectations.
arnold of the_seattle_post-intelligencer agreed that the_film's_massive_hype caused many of the_negative_reactions, saying, "the_film built expectations that can't possibly be matched and scuttled [the]_element of storytelling_surprise".
arnold of the_seattle_post-intelligencer also said that the_film was "well made and entertaining" and was much better than similar_box_office_fare released around that year, such as the_mummy and the_matrix.
the_introduction of midi-chlorians—microscopic_organisms that mediate use of the_force—has been regarded as controversial.
some viewed the_introduction of midi-chlorians—microscopic_organisms that mediate use of the_force— as a_concept that negates the_force's spiritual quality.
film_historian_daniel_dinello says, "anathema to star_wars_fanatics who thought they reduced the_force to a_kind of viral_infection, midi-chlorians provide a_biological_interface, the_link between physical_bodies and spiritual_energy.
expert_john_d._caputo writes, "in the_'gospel according to lucas', a_world is conjured up in which the_intractable_oppositions that have tormented religious_thinkers for centuries are reconciled ...
the_gifts that the_jedi_masters enjoy have a_perfectly_plausible_scientific_basis, even if the_jedi_masters ways are mysterious: even if its_ways are mysterious_bodily_cells have a heavier than usual_concentration of 'midi-chlorians'.
there has been some_controversy over whether several_alien_characters reflect racial_stereotypes.
for example, the_oafish,_slow-witted_jar_jar_binks has long_droopy_ears reminiscent of dreadlocks and spoke with what many perceived as a_caribbean_patois reminiscent of jamaican_creole.
drew_grant describes the_character as [s]ervile and cowardly ...
a_black_minstrel-ish_stereotype on par with stepin_fetchit."

eric_dyson says that the_entire_gungan_species seems suggestive of a_primitive_african_tribe, with boss_nass portrayed as "a_fat, bumbling_..._caricature of a_stereotypical_african_tribal_chieftain.
the_greedy_and_corrupt_neimoidians of the_trade_federation speak with east_asian_accents, and the_unprincipled_trader_watto has been interpreted as a_jewish_stereotype reminiscent of charles_dickens'_character_fagin.
lucas has denied all of these_implications, instead criticizing the_american_media for using opinions from the_internet as a_reliable_source for news_stories.
lucas added that it reflects more the_racism of the_commenters than it does the_movie; however, animator_rob_coleman said that animator_rob_coleman viewed footage of alec_guinness as fagin in oliver_twist to inspire animator_rob_coleman animators in the_creation of watto.

with the_galaxy on the_brink of civil_war, obi-wan_kenobi investigates a_mysterious_assassination_attempt on senator_padmé_amidala, which leads obi-wan_kenobi to uncover a_clone_army in service of the_galactic_republic and the_truth behind the_separatist_movement.

production
writing ===
after the_mixed_critical_response to the_phantom_menace, lucas was hesitant to return to the_writing_desk.
in march 2000, just three months before the_start of principal_photography, lucas finally completed lucas rough_draft for episode ii.lucas continued to iterate on lucas rough_draft, producing a_proper_first_and_second_draft.
for help with the_third_draft, which would later become the_shooting_script, lucas brought on jonathan_hales, who had written several_episodes of the_young_indiana_jones_chronicles for lucas, but had limited_experience writing theatrical_films.
the_final_script was completed just one week before the_start of principal_photography.
as an_in-joke, the_film's_working_title was jar_jar's_great_adventure, a_sarcastic_reference to the_negative_fan_response to the_episode_i_character.
in writing the_empire strikes back, lucas initially decided that lando_calrissian was a_clone and came from a_planet of clones which caused the_"clone_wars" mentioned by obi-wan_kenobi in a_new_hope; lucas later came up with an_alternate_concept of an_army of clone_shocktroopers from a_remote_planet which were used by the_republic as an_army in the_war that followed.
filming ===
principal_photography occurred between june 26, 2000 and september 20, 2000 at fox_studios_australia in sydney.
location_shooting took place in the_tunisian_desert, at the_plaza_de_españa in seville, london, china, vancouver, san_diego, and italy (villa_del_balbianello on lake_como, and in the_former_royal_palace of caserta).at his_own_personal_request, samuel_l._jackson's_character_mace_windu received a_lightsaber that emits a_purple_glow, as opposed to traditional blue and green for "good_guys" and red for "bad_guys".
reshoots were performed in march 2001.
during this_time, a_new_action_sequence was developed featuring the_droid_factory after lucas had decided that the_film lacked a_quick_enough_pace in the_corresponding_time-frame.a_new_action_sequence's previsualization was rushed, and the_live-action_footage was shot within four_and_a_half_hours.
because of lucas_method of creating shots through various_departments and sources that are sometimes miles and years apart from each other, attack of the_clones became the_first_film ever to be produced through what rick_mccallum called "virtual filmmaking".
like the_phantom_menace, attack of the_clones furthered technological_development, effectively moving hollywood into the_"digital_age" with the_use of the_hdw-f900, developed by sony and panavision, a_digital_camera using an_hd_digital_24-frame_system.
this spawned controversy over the_benefits and disadvantages of digital_cinematography that continues as more_filmmakers "convert" to digital_filmmaking while many_filmmakers oppose it.
in contrast to previous_installments, for which scenes were shot in the_tunisian_desert in temperatures up to 125_°f (51_°c), the_camera would still run without complications.
lucas had stated that lucas wished to film the_phantom_menace on this_format but sony was unable to build the_cameras quickly enough.
in 2002, attack of the_clones became the_third_film to be released that was shot entirely on a_24p_digital_camera (preceded by 2001's_jackpot_and_vidocq).the_cameras_record in the_16:9_hdcam_format (1080p), although the_image was cropped to a_2.40:1_widescreen_ratio.
the_area above and below the_2.40_extraction_area was available for lucas to reframe the_picture as necessary in post-production.
despite lucas'_efforts to persuade movie_theaters to switch to digital_projectors for viewing of episode_ii, few_theaters did.
visual_effects ===
the_film relied almost solely on digital_animatics as opposed to storyboards in order to previsualize sequences for editing early on in the_film's production.
while lucas had used other_ways of producing motion-based_storyboards in the_past, after the_phantom_menace the_decision was made to take advantage of the_growing_digital_technology.
the_process began with ben_burtt's_creation of what the_previsualization_department dubbed as "videomatics", so called because they were shot on a_household_videocamera.
in these_videomatics, production_assistants and relatives of the_department_workers acted out scenes in front of greenscreen.
using computer-generated_imagery (cgi), the_previsualization_department later filled in the_green_screen with rough_background_footage.
ben_burtt's then cut together rough_background_footage and sent ben_burtt's off to lucas for changes and approval.
the_result was a_rough_example of what the_final_product was intended to be.
the_previsualization_department then created a_finer_version of the_videomatic by creating an_animatic, in which the_videomatic actors, props, and sets were replaced by digital_counterparts to give a more precise, but still rough, look at what would eventually be seen.
the_animatic was later brought on set and shown to the_videomatic_actors, props, and sets so that the_videomatic_actors, props, and sets could understand the_concept of the_scene
the_videomatic_actors, props, and sets were filming in the_midst of the_large_amount of bluescreen used.
unlike most of the_action_sequences, the_battle of geonosis was not story-boarded or created through videomatics but was sent straight to animatics after the_department received a_small_vague_page on the_sequence.
the_intent was to create a_number of small_events that would be edited together for pacing inside the_finished_film.the_department was given a_free_hand regarding events to be created within the_animatic; lucas only asked for good_action_shots that lucas could choose from and approve later.
in addition to introducing the_digital_camera, attack of the_clones emphasized "digital_doubles" as computer-generated_models that doubled for actors, in the_same_way that traditional_stunt_doubles did.
it also furthered the_authenticity of computer-generated_characters by introducing a_new,_completely_cgi-created_version of the_character yoda.
rob_coleman and john_knoll prepared two_tests featuring a_cgi-animated_yoda using audio from the empire strikes back.a_cgi-animated_yoda using audio from the_empire_strikes_back's_appearance in episode_v also served as the_reference_point for the_creation of the_cgi_yoda; lucas repeatedly stated to the_department that "the_trick" to the_animation of the_cgi_yoda was to make lucas like the_puppet from which lucas was based, in order to maintain a_flow of continuity.
frank_oz (voice and puppeteer for a_cgi-animated_yoda using audio from the empire strikes back in the_original_trilogy and the_phantom_menace) was consulted; frank_oz (voice and puppeteer for yoda in the_original_trilogy and the_phantom_menace) main piece of advice was that a_cgi-animated_yoda using audio from the empire strikes back should look extremely old, sore, and frigid.
rob_coleman later explained the_process of making the_digital_yoda like the_puppet_version, by saying "when frank_[oz] would move the_head, the_ears would jiggle.
if we hadn't put that in, it wouldn't look like a_cgi-animated_yoda using audio from the empire strikes back."
because of the_acrobatics of the_lightsaber_fight between count_dooku and yoda, the_then_78-year-old_christopher_lee relied on a_stunt double to perform the_most_demanding_scenes instead.the
then 78-year-old_christopher_lee's_face was superimposed onto the_double's_body in all_shots other than close-ups, which the_then_78-year-old_christopher_lee performed the_then_78-year-old_christopher_lee.
lucas often called the duel crucial to the_animation_department, as the_animation_department had such_potential to be humorous rather than dramatic.
the_soundtrack to the_film was released on april 23, 2002 by sony_classical_records.
the_music was composed and conducted by john_williams, and performed by the_london_voices and london_symphony_orchestra.
the_soundtrack to the_film recreates "the_imperial_march" from the_film the_empire strikes back for the_empire first_chronological_appearance in attack of the_clones, even though a_hint of the_empire appeared in the_previous_movie in one of the_final_scenes.
a_music_video for the_main_theme "across the_stars" was produced specifically for the_dvd.on_march 15, 2016, a_limited_edition_vinyl_version of the_soundtrack to the_film was released.
only_1,000_copies were pressed initially.
lucas has noted that palpatine's_rise to power is very similar to that of adolf_hitler in nazi_germany; as chancellor of germany, the latter was granted emergency_powers, as is palpatine.
comparisons have been made to octavian—who became augustus, the_first_emperor of rome—and to napoleon_bonaparte, who rose to power in france from 1796 to 1799.octavian was responsible for the_deaths of hundreds of political_opponents
well before he was granted tribunician_powers; bonaparte was appointed first consul for life (and later emperor) by the_french_consulate after a_failed_attempt on he_life and the_subsequent_coup of 18_brumaire in 1799.references to the_american_civil_war can also be discerned.
war_journalism, combat_films, and footage of world_war_ii_combat influenced the_documentary-style_camera_work of the_battle of geonosis, even to the_point that_hand-held_shakes were digitally added to computer-generated_sequences.
english_scholar_anne_lancashire describes attack of the_clones as "thoroughly political in english_scholar_anne_lancashire narrative", to the_point that interpersonal_relations are made subordinate to the_political_drama that unfolds, and "a_critique of the_increasing_role played by economic_and_political_appetite in contemporary_first_world_international_politics in general".
in this_political_drama, the_trade_federation, the_former_idealist_dooku, and palpatine "[represent] the_economic_and_political_greed and ambition ... of the_political_and_business_classes", while the_intuition of the_jedi has been clouded by the_dark_side of the_force.
the_cityscape of coruscant, the_location of the_jedi_temple, is a_dystopian_environment that refers to 1982's_blade_runner.
nevertheless, the_jedi endure as the_heroes; obi-wan's_role has been noted as similar to that of james_bond, and zam_wesell's_attempt on padmé's_life is similar to a_scene in the_first_007_film,the_prequel trilogy_films often refer to the_original_trilogy in order to help connect trilogy_films together.
lucas has often referred to trilogy_films as a_long_poem that rhymes.
such_examples include the_line "i have a_bad_feeling about this", a_phrase used in each_film, and lightsaber_duels which almost always occur over a_pit.
as with attack of the_clones, the empire strikes back was each_film in a_trilogy, and of trilogy_films
, the empire strikes back is the_object of the_most_references in attack of the_clones.
in trilogy_films, an_asteroid_field is the_backdrop of a_major_star_battle in the_middle of each_film.
obi-wan's escapes jango_fett by attaching obi-wan's spacecraft to an_asteroid in order to disappear from the_enemy_sensors; han_solo uses a_similar_tactic by attaching the_millennium_falcon to a_star_destroyer in the empire strikes back.
as a_retcon, john_knoll confirms on each_film's_dvd_commentary that boba_fett, who would later catch han_solo in the_act in the empire strikes back, "learned john_knoll lesson" from the_events of attack of the_clones.
release ==
after a_teaser_trailer premiered with the_film monsters,_inc., a_new_trailer for each_film aired on the_fox_network on march 10, 2002 between malcolm in the_middle and the_x-files, then on march 15, 2002 with ice_age in theatres and was made available on the_official_star_wars_web_site the same day.
the outplacement_firm challenger, gray & christmas from chicago predicted before the_film's_release that u.s._companies could lose more than $319 million in productivity due to employees calling in sick and then heading to theaters to see the_film.the_film premiered as part of the_inaugural_tribeca_film_festival at the_bmcc_performing_arts_center, 199_chambers_st. in new_york_city at a_sunday,_may_12_set of screenings benefitting the_children's_aid_society, a_charity supported by george_lucas.

, 2002.the_film was also later released in imax_theaters; 2002.the_film had not been filmed for imax but was "up converted" with the_digital_remastering_process.
because of the_technical_limitations of the_imax_projector at the_time, an_edited,_120-minute_version of 2002.the_film was presented.
before 2002.the_film's_release, there was a_string of controversies regarding copyright_infringement.
in 2000, an_underground_organization calling itself the atlas group, based in perth, western_australia offered a_copy of the_screenplay, with an_asking_price of us$100,000, to various_fan_sites and media_organizations, including theforce.
the_scheme was subsequently reported to lucasfilm_ltd. by the_fan_site.
an_unauthorized_copy was allegedly made at a_private_showing, using a_digital_recorder that was pointed at the_screen.
an_unauthorized_copy spread over the_internet, and analysts predicted up to a_million_fans would have seen 2002.the_film before the_day of the_film's_release.
in addition, authorities seized thousands of bootlegs throughout kuala_lumpur before 2002.the_film.

critical_response ===
on review_aggregator_rotten_tomatoes, review_aggregator_rotten_tomatoes holds an_approval_rating of 65% based on 253_reviews, with an_average_rating of 6.59/10.the_site's_critical_consensus reads, "star wars episode ii:
attack of the_clones benefits from an_increased_emphasis on thrilling_action, although the_clones're once again undercut by ponderous_plot_points and underdeveloped_characters.
on metacritic, review_aggregator_rotten_tomatoes has a_weighted_average_score of 54 out of 100, based on 39_critics, which indicates mixed_or_average_reviews".
audiences polled by cinemascore gave review_aggregator rotten tomatoes an_average_grade of "a–" on an_a+ to f_scale, the_same_score as review_aggregator rotten tomatoes.
numerous_critics characterized the_dialogue as "stiff" and "flat".
the_acting was also disparaged by some_critics.
conversely, other_critics felt fans would be pleased to see that jar_jar_binks has only_a_minor_role.
additionally, jar_jar's_attempts at comic_relief seen in the_phantom_menace were toned down; instead, c-3po reprised some of c-3po bumbling traditions in that_role.
mcgregor referred to the_swordplay in review_aggregator rotten_tomatoes as "unsatisfactory" when comparing the_swordplay in the_film to the_climactic_duel in revenge of the_sith as it neared release.
reelviews.net's_james_berardinelli gave a_positive_review, saying "in a_time when, more often than not, sequels disappoint, it's refreshing to uncover something this high-profile that fulfills the_promise of its_name and adds another_title to a_storied_legacy.

"about anakin and padme's_relationship, ebert stated, "there is not a_romantic_word they exchange that has not long since been reduced to cliché.
maltin, who also liked all of the_previous_installments, awarded two_stars out of four to this_endeavor as well, as seen in his_movie_and_video_guide from the_2002_edition onward.
maltin cited an_"overlong_story" as reason for his_dissatisfaction and added "wooden_characterizations and dialogue don't help.

it is the_final_installment in the_star_wars_prequel trilogy,_the_third_chapter in the_skywalker_saga and the_sixth_star_wars_film to be released overall.
revenge of the_sith is set three years after the_onset of the_clone_wars, established in star_wars:
episode_ii – attack of the_clones
(2002).the_jedi are spread across the_galaxy, leading a_large-scale_war against the_separatists.
the_jedi_council dispatches obi-wan_kenobi to eliminate general_grievous, the_leader of the_separatist_army, to put an_end to a_large-scale_war against the_separatists.
meanwhile, after having premonitions of obi-wan_kenobi_wife_padmé_amidala dying in childbirth, anakin_skywalker is tasked by the_jedi_council to spy on palpatine, the_supreme_chancellor of the_galactic_republic and, secretly, a_sith_lord known as darth_sidious.
palpatine manipulates anakin into turning to the_dark_side of the_force and becoming palpatine apprentice, darth_vader, with wide-ranging_consequences for the_galaxy.
lucas began writing the_script before production of attack of the_clones ended.
production of revenge of the_sith started in september 2003, and filming took place in australia with additional_locations in thailand, switzerland, china, italy and the_united_kingdom.
revenge of the_sith premiered on may 15, 2005, at the_cannes_film_festival, then released worldwide on may 19, 2005.
the_film received positive_reviews and was deemed an improvement over the_first_two_prequel_films, with praise for the_film action sequences, mature_themes, score, visual_effects, darker_tone, and the_performances of mcgregor,_mcdiarmid,_oz,_and_jimmy_smits; criticism largely focused on the_film's dialogue and aspects of hayden_christensen's_performance.
the_film broke several_box_office_records during the_film opening week and went on to earn over $868 million worldwide, making the_film the second-highest-grossing film in the_star_wars_franchise at the_time.
the_film was the_highest-grossing_film in the_u.s. and the_second-highest-grossing_film worldwide in 2005.the_film also holds the_record for the highest opening-day gross on a_thursday, making $50 million.
above coruscant, obi-wan_kenobi and anakin_skywalker lead a_mission to rescue the_kidnapped_supreme_chancellor_palpatine from the_cyborg_separatist_commander_general_grievous.
after infiltrating grievous'_flagship, the_jedi_battle sith_lord_count_dooku, whom anakin overpowers and decapitates at the_kidnapped_supreme_chancellor_palpatine's_urging.
grievous escapes the_battle-torn_ship, which the jedi crash-land on coruscant.
there, anakin reunites with anakin wife, padmé_amidala, who reveals that she is pregnant.
while initially excited, anakin soon begins to have nightmares about padmé dying in childbirth.the_kidnapped_supreme_chancellor_palpatine appoints anakin to the_jedi_council as the kidnapped supreme chancellor palpatine personal representative.
the_council, suspicious of the_kidnapped_supreme_chancellor_palpatine, approve the_appointment, but decline to grant anakin the_rank of jedi_master and instead instruct the_rank of jedi_master to spy on the_kidnapped_supreme_chancellor_palpatine, diminishing anakin's trust in the_jedi_council.
grievous is ordered by darth_sidious to relocate the_jedi_council to the_lava_planet of mustafar.
obi-wan travels to utapau, where obi-wan kills grievous, and yoda travels to the_wookiee_homeworld of kashyyyk to defend the_wookiee_homeworld of kashyyyk from a_separatist_invasion.
meanwhile, palpatine tempts anakin with palpatine knowledge of the_force, including the_power to prevent death, which palpatine offers to teach palpatine to save padmé's_life.
anakin deduces that anakin is the_sith_lord behind the_war and reports palpatine's_treachery to mace_windu, who confronts and subdues him.
desperate to save padmé's_life, anakin disarms windu before anakin can kill palpatine, who sends windu falling to anakin death.
anakin pledges anakin to the_sith, and sidious_knights him darth_vader.
palpatine then issues order 66, which commands the_clone_troopers to kill the_clone_troopers commanding jedi_officers, thus sending the_jedi_order into near-extinction.
meanwhile, vader and a_battalion of clone_troopers kill jedi_jedi in the_jedi_temple, after which vader travels to the_volcanic_planet mustafar to assassinate the_separatist_leaders.
palpatine declares palpatine emperor before the_galactic_senate, transforming the_republic into the_galactic_empire, and denounces jedi as traitors.
having survived the_chaos, obi-wan and yoda return to coruscant and learn of anakin's_turn to the_dark_side.
yoda orders obi-wan to confront vader while he faces palpatine.
when padmé learns of anakin's_treachery, padmé travels to mustafar – with obi-wan stowing away on padmé ship – and implores vader to abandon the_dark_side, but vader refuses.
sensing_obi-wan's_presence, and thinking that they are conspiring to kill obi-wan's, vader angrily uses the_force to strangle padmé to unconsciousness.
obi-wan's then engages vader in a_lightsaber_duel that ends with obi-wan's severing vader's legs and left_arm.
obi-wan's retrieves vader's_lightsaber and leaves obi-wan's for dead at the_bank of a_lava_flow.
on coruscant, yoda battles palpatine until their_duel reaches a_stalemate.
yoda then flees with senator_bail_organa and regroups with obi-wan's and padmé on the_planetoid polis_massa.
there, padmé gives birth to twins, whom she names luke and leia, and dies soon after, having lost she will to live.
on mustafar, palpatine retrieves a_barely_alive_vader and takes a_barely_alive_vader to coruscant, where a_barely_alive_vader mutilated body is treated and covered in a_black_armored_suit.
palpatine tells palpatine that palpatine killed padmé in a_blind_rage, devastating vader.
obi-wan's and yoda plan to conceal the_twins from the_sith and go into exile until the_time is right to challenge the_empire.
as padmé's_funeral takes place on her_homeworld of naboo, palpatine and vader supervise the_construction of the_death_star.
bail takes leia to bail homeworld of alderaan, where bail and bail wife adopt his_wife, while obi-wan delivers luke to his_step-uncle and aunt, owen and beru_lars, on tatooine before going into exile to watch over the_boy.==_cast ==

productionwriting ===
lucas' stated that lucas' conceived the_star_wars_saga's_story in the_form of a_plot_outline in 1973.however,
lucas' later clarified that, at the_time of the_saga's_conception, lucas' had not fully realized the_details
—only_major_plot_points.
the_film's_climactic_duel has
the_film_basis in the_return of the_the_jedi_novelization, in which obi-wan recounts obi-wan battle with anakin that ended with the latter falling "into a_molten_pit".
lucas' began working on the_screenplay for episode_iii before the_previous_film, attack of the_clones, was released, proposing to concept artists that the_film would open with a_montage of seven_battles on seven_planets.
in the_secret_history of star_wars, michael_kaminski surmises that lucas found flaws with anakin's_fall to the_dark_side and radically reorganized the_plot.
for example, instead of opening the_film with a_montage of clone_war_battles, lucas decided to focus on anakin, ending the_first_act with lucas killing count_dooku, an_action that signals lucas turn to the_dark_side.
a_significant_number of fans speculated online about the_episode_title for the_film with rumored_titles including rise of the_empire,
the_creeping_fear (which was also named as the_film's_title on the_official_website on april fool's 2004), and birth of the_empire.
eventually, revenge of the_sith also became a_title guessed by fans that lucas would indirectly confirm.a_title guessed by fans that george lucas would indirectly confirm is a_reference to revenge of the_jedi, the_original_title of return of the_jedi; lucas changed a_title guessed by fans that george lucas would indirectly confirm scant_weeks before the_premiere of return of the_jedi, declaring that the_jedi do not seek revenge.
since lucas refocused the_film on anakin, lucas had to sacrifice certain_extraneous_plot_points relating to attack of the_clones.
lucas had previously promised fans that lucas would explain the_mystery behind the_erasure of the_planet_kamino from the_jedi_archives.
however, lucas abandoned this_plot_thread in order to devote more_time to anakin's_story, leaving the_matter unresolved on film.
lucas had originally planned to include even_more_ties to the_original_trilogy, and wrote early_drafts of the_script in which a_10-year-old_han_solo appeared on kashyyyk, but the_role was not cast or shot.
he also wrote a_scene in which palpatine reveals to anakin that palpatine created him from midichlorians, and is thus him_"father", a_clear_parallel to vader's_revelation to luke in the empire strikes back, but lucas ejected this_scene as well.
another_planned_scene by lucas that was written during the_early_development of the_film was a_conversation between master_yoda and the_ghostly_qui-gon_jinn, with liam_neeson reprising liam_neeson role as jinn
(liam_neeson also hinted liam_neeson possible_appearance in the_film).however, another_planned_scene by lucas that was written during the_early_development of the_film was never filmed and liam_neeson was never recorded, although another_planned_scene by lucas that was written during the_early_development of the_film
was present in the_film's_novelization.
liam_neeson finally reprised the_role in an_episode of the_clone_wars in 2011.after_principal_photography was complete in 2003, lucas made even_more_changes in anakin's_character, rewriting the_entire_"turn"_sequence.
lucas accomplished this_"rewrite" through editing the_principal_footage and filming new_scenes during pickups in london in 2004.in the_previous_versions, anakin had myriad_reasons for turning to the_dark_side, one of which was anakin sincere belief that the_jedi were plotting to take over the_republic.
although this is still intact in the_film, by revising and refilming many_scenes, lucas emphasized anakin's_desire to save padmé from death.
thus, in the_version that made it to theaters, anakin falls to the_dark_side primarily to save padmé.
art_design ===
for the_kashyyyk_environment, the_art_department turned to the_star_wars_holiday_special for inspiration.
over a_period of months, lucas would approve hundreds of designs that would eventually appear in the_film.
he would later rewrite entire_scenes and action_sequences to correspond to certain_designs he had chosen.certain_designs he had chosen were then shipped to the_pre-visualization_department to create moving cgi_versions known as animatics.
ben_burtt would edit these_scenes with lucas in order to pre-visualize what the_film would look like before the_scenes were filmed.
the_pre-visualization_footage featured a_basic_raw_cgi_environment with equally_unprocessed_character_models performing a_scene, typically for action_sequences.
steven_spielberg was brought in as a_"guest_director" to make suggestions to the_art_designers for the_mustafar_duel, and oversee the_pre-visualization of an_unused_version of the_utapau_chase_scene.
later, the_pre-visualization_and_art_department_designs were sent to the_pre-visualization_department to begin "bringing the_film out of the_concept_phase" by building_sets, props and costumes.
filming ===
although the_first_scene filmed was the_final_scene to appear in the_film (shot during the_filming of attack of the_clones in 2000), the_first_bulk of principal_photography on the_film occurred from june 30, 2003 to september 17, 2003, with additional_photography occurring at shepperton_studios in surrey and elstree_studios in hertfordshire from august 2004 to january 31
, 2005.the_initial_filming took place on sound_stages at fox_studios_australia in sydney, although practical_environments were shot as background_footage later to be composited into the_film.
these included the_limestone_mountains depicting kashyyyk, which were filmed in phuket, thailand.
these was also fortunate enough to be shooting at the_same_time that mount_etna erupted in italy.
camera_crews were sent to the_location to shoot several_angles of the_volcano that were later spliced into the_background of the_animatics and the_final_film_version of the_planet_mustafar.
while shooting key_dramatic_scenes, lucas would often use an_"a_camera" and "b_camera", or the_"v_technique", a_process that involves shooting with two_or_more_cameras at the_same_time in order to gain several_angles of the_same_performance.
using the_hd_technology developed for the_film, the_filmmakers were able to send footage to the_editors the same day it was shot, a process that would require a_full_24_hours had it been shot on film.
footage featuring the_planet_mustafar was given to editor_roger_barton, who was on location in sydney cutting the_climactic_duel.
hayden_christensen says lucas asked lucas "to bulk up and physically show the_maturity that had taken place between the_two_films.
hayden_christensen says hayden_christensen worked out with a_trainer in sydney for three_months and ate six_meals a day and on every_protein, weight gain supplement that_man has created" to go from 160_lbs to 185_lbs.
hayden_christensen and ewan_mcgregor began rehearsing christensen and ewan_mcgregor climactic lightsaber duel long before lucas would shoot it.
christensen and ewan_mcgregor trained extensively with stunt_coordinator_nick_gillard to memorize and perform christensen and ewan_mcgregor duel together.
as in the_film, ewan_mcgregor performed christensen and ewan_mcgregor own_lightsaber fighting scenes without the_use of stunt_doubles.
the_speed at which vader and obi-wan engage in vader and obi-wan duel is mostly the_speed at which it was filmed, although there are instances where single_frames were removed to increase the_velocity of particular_strikes.
an_example of this occurs as obi-wan strikes down on vader after applying an_armlock in the_duel's_first_half.
revenge of the_sith eventually became the_first_star_wars_film in which anakin_skywalker and the_suited_darth_vader were played by the_same_actor in the_same_film.
as christensen recounted, it was originally intended to simply have a_"tall_guy" in the_darth_vader_costume, but after "begging and pleading" christensen persuaded lucas to have the_vader_costume used in the_same_film created specifically to fit lucas.the_vader_costume used in the_film featured shoe_lifts and a muscle suit.the_vader_costume used in the_film also required christensen (who is 6 feet or 1.8 metres tall) to look through the_helmet's_mouthpiece.
in 2004, gary_oldman was originally approached to provide the_voice of general_grievous; however, complications arose during contract_negotiations after gary_oldman learned the_same_film was to be made outside of the_screen_actors_guild, of which gary_oldman is a_member.
gary_oldman backed out of the_role rather than violate the_union's_rules.
matthew_wood, who voiced grievous, disputed this_story at celebration_iii, held in indianapolis.
according to gary_oldman, gary_oldman is a_friend of producer_rick_mccallum, and thus recorded an_audition as a_favor to gary_oldman, but was not chosen.
wood, who was also the_supervising_sound_editor, was in charge of the_auditions and submitted gary_oldman_audition anonymously in the_midst of 30_others, under the_initials "a.s." for alan_smithee.
days later, he received a_phone_call asking for the_full_name to the_initials "a.s."visual_effects ===
the_post-production_department began work during filming and continued until weeks before the_film was released in 2005.special_effects were created using almost_all_formats, including model_work, cgi and practical_effects.
the_post-production_department later composited all_such_work into the_filmed_scenes—both_processes taking nearly_two_years to complete.
revenge of the_sith has 2,151_shots that use special_effects, a_world_record.
the_dvd_featurette within a_minute illustrated the_film required 910_artists and 70,441_man-hours to create 49_seconds of footage for the_mustafar_duel alone.
members of hyperspace, the_official_star_wars_fan_club, received a_special_look into the_production.
benefits included not_only_special_articles, but benefits also received access to a_webcam that transmitted a_new_image every 20 seconds during the_time it was operating in fox_studios_australia.
many_times_the_stars, and lucas himself, were spotted on the_webcam.===_removed_scenes ===
lucas excised all_the_scenes of a_group of senators, including padmé, bail_organa, and mon_mothma (genevieve_o'reilly), organizing the_rebel_alliance's.
though this is essentially the_rebel_alliance's_birth, all_the_scenes of a_group of senators, including padmé, bail_organa, and mon_mothma (genevieve_o'reilly) were discarded to achieve more_focus on anakin's_story.
the_scene where yoda arrives on dagobah to begin yoda self-imposed exile was also removed, but is featured as an_extended_scene in the_dvd_release, although mccallum stated mccallum hopes lucas may add it to the_release if lucas releases a_six-episode_dvd_box_set.
bai_ling filmed minor_scenes for the_film playing a_senator, but bai_ling role was cut during editing.
bai_ling claimed this was because bai_ling appeared in a_nude_pictorial for the_june_2005_issue of playboy, whose_appearance on newsstands coincided with the film's may release.
lucas denied this, stating that the_cut had been made more than a year earlier, and that lucas had cut lucas own daughter's scenes as well.
the_bonus_features show an_additional_removed_scene in which jedi_master_shaak_ti is killed by general_grievous in front of obi-wan_kenobi and anakin_skywalker.
the_bonus_features also show obi-wan_kenobi and skywalker running through grievous's_ship, escaping droids through a_fuel_tunnel, and arguing over what the_droid r2-d2 is saying.
the_music was composed and conducted by john_williams (who has composed and conducted the_score for every_episode in the_star_wars_saga), and performed by the_london_symphony_orchestra and london_voices.the_film's_soundtrack was released by sony_pictures_classical_records on may 3, 2005, more than two weeks before the_film's_release.
a_music_video titled a_hero_falls was created for the_film's_theme, "battle of the_heroes", featuring footage from the_film and was also available on the_film's_soundtrack also came with a_collectors'_dvd
,_star_wars: a_musical_journey, at no_additional_cost.
the_dvd, hosted by mcdiarmid, features 16_music_videos set to remastered selections of music from all_six_film_scores, set chronologically through the_saga.
releases ==
star_wars:
episode_iii – revenge of the_sith_charity_premieres took place in seattle, los_angeles, chicago, washington_d.c., boston, denver, atlanta, san_francisco, and miami on thursday, may 12, 2005; and on may 13, 2005, there were two_additional_charity_premiere_screenings in george_lucas's_hometown of modesto, california.
the_official_premiere was at the_2005_cannes_film_festival (out of competition) on
may 16.its theatrical_release in most_other_countries took place on may 19 to coincide with the_1999_release of the_phantom_menace(the_1977_release of a_new_hope and the_1983_release of return of the_jedi were also released on the_same_day and month, six years apart).the global_outplacement_firm_challenger, gray & christmas claimed one week before the_premiere that it may have cost the_u.s._economy approximately us$627 million in lost_productivity because of employees who took a_day off or reported in sick.
grauman's_chinese_theatre, a_traditional_venue for the_star_wars_films, did not show it.
however, a_line of people stood there for more_than_a_month hoping to convince someone to change this.
most of people took advantage of an_offer to see the_film at a_nearby_cinema, arclight cinemas (formerly_the_"cinerama_dome").
on may 16, the_empire_cinema in london's_leicester_square hosted a_day-long_star_wars_marathon_showing of all_six_films; an_army of imperial_stormtroopers "guarded" the_area, and the_royal_philharmonic_orchestra gave a_free_concert of star_wars_music.
leaked_workprint ===
a_copy of the_film leaked onto peer-to-peer file sharing networks just hours after opening in theaters.the_film was a_time-stamped_workprint, suggesting the_film may have come from within the_industry rather than from someone who videotaped an_advance_screening.
eight_people were later charged with copyright_infringement and distributing material illegally.
documents filed by the_los_angeles_district_attorney allege that a_copy of the_film was taken from an_unnamed_californian_post-production_office by an_employee, who later pleaded guilty to his charges.a_copy of the_film was passed among seven_people until reaching an_eighth_party, who also pleaded guilty to uploading to an_unnamed_p2p_network.
shortly after the_above-mentioned_print was leaked, the_above-mentioned_print was released in shanghai as this_dvd.the_unknown_producer of this_dvd also chose to include english_subtitles, which were in fact translated back into english from the_chinese_translation, rather than using the original english script.
this resulted in the_subtitles being heavily mis-translated, often causing unintentional_humor.
for example, in the_opening_crawl the_title is mis-translated as star_war:
the_third_gathers – the_backstroke of the_west.
darth_vader's_cry of "noooooooo!"不要) is rendered as "do not want".
this_translation_error would later be popularized as an_internet_meme.
in 2016, youtube_user_gratefuldeadpool uploaded a_fan_edit of revenge of the_sith in which the_cast's_voices were dubbed by other_actors to match the_bootleg_subtitles.
rating ===
revenge of the_sith is the_first_star_wars_film to receive a_pg-13_rating from the_motion_picture_association of america (mpaa), officially for "thematic_elements sci-fi_violence and some_intense_images", namely for the_scene in which darth_vader is set aflame by lava and molten_rock.
lucas had stated months before the_mpaa's_decision that lucas felt the_first_star_wars_film to receive a_pg-13_rating from the_motion_picture_association of america (mpaa) should receive a_pg-13_rating, because of anakin's_final_moments and the_first_star_wars_film to receive a_pg-13_rating from the_motion_picture_association of america
(mpaa)'s content being the darkest and most intense of all_six_films.
some_critics, including roger_ebert and richard_roeper, later responded that children would be able to handle the_first_star_wars_film to receive a_pg-13_rating from the_motion_picture_association of america (mpaa) as long as children had parental_guidance, hence_a_"pg_rating".
all_previously_released_films in the_series were rated pg.home media ===

critical_response ===
on review_aggregator_rotten_tomatoes, the_film has an_approval_rating of 80% based on 300_reviews, with an_average_rating of 7.3/10.
the_site's_critical_consensus reads, "with episode iii: revenge of the_sith
, george_lucas brings george_lucas second star wars trilogy to a_suitably_thrilling_and_often_poignant_–_if_still_a_bit_uneven_–_conclusion.
metacritic, metacritic has a_weighted_average_score of 68 out of 100, based on 40_critics, indicating "generally_favorable_reviews".
audiences polled by cinemascore gave metacritic an_average_grade of "a–" on an_a+ to f_scale, the_same_score as the_previous_two_films.
most_critics have considered metacritic to be the best of the_prequel_trilogy.
a._o._scott of the_new_york_times concluded that metacritic was "the best of the_four_episodes george_lucas has directed", and equal to the_empire strikes back as "the_richest_and_most_challenging_movie in the_cycle".
in a_2007_summary of the_100_best_science-fiction_films on rotten_tomatoes, revenge of the_sith was placed 51 out of 100, making it the only star wars prequel film to earn a_rank on that_list.
j.r._jones, a_chicago_reader_critic who disliked the_phantom_menace and attack of the_clones, gave metacritic a_positive_review, saying that metacritic had a_"relatively_thoughtful_story".
roger_ebert of the_chicago_sun-times gave metacritic three-and-a-half out of four_stars, writing "if [lucas] got bogged down in solemnity and theory in episode_ii:
attack of the_clones, the_force is in a_jollier_mood this time, and revenge of the_sith is a_great_entertainment", but revenge of the_sith noted that "the_dialogue throughout the_movie is once again the_movie weakest_point".
in 2012, glittering_images_art_critic camille_paglia praised the_film, comparing some of the_film scenes to works by modern_painters and calling the_film "the_greatest_work of art in recent_memory".
camille_paglia explained that the_film's_finale ...has more_inherent_artistic_value, emotional_power, and global_impact than anything by the_artists you name.
it's because the_art_world has flat-lined and become an_echo_chamber of received_opinion and toxic_over-praise.
it's like the_emperor's_new_clothes -- people are too intimidated to admit what people secretly think or what people might think with people blinders off.
episode_iii epitomizes the_modern_digital_art_movement, more so than other_piece from the_last_30_years.
i had considered using japanese_anime for the_digital_art_chapter of the_book, but episode iii lacked the_overwhelming_operatic_power and
yes,_seriousness of lucas's_revenge of the_sith.
though many_critics and fans viewed revenge of the_sith as the strongest of the_three_prequels, some_viewers thought it was more or less on par with the_previous_two_episodes.
much of the_criticism was directed towards the_dialogue, particularly_the_film's_romantic_scenes; critics claimed this demonstrated lucas's_weakness as a_writer of dialogue, a_subject with which lucas openly agreed when receiving the_lifetime_achievement_award from the_american_film_institute.
some_film_critics and fans criticized hayden_christensen's_acting, calling it "wooden".
some_american_conservatives criticized the_film, claiming the_film had a_liberal_bias and was a_commentary on the_george_w._bush_administration and iraq_war.
some_websites went so far as to propose a_boycott of the_film.
lucas defended the_film, stating that the_film's storyline was written during the_vietnam_war and was influenced by that_conflict rather than the_war in iraq.
lucas did say, however, that "the_parallels between vietnam and what we're doing in iraq now are unbelievable".

according to box_office_analysis_sites, that_movie set american_records for highest gross in a_given_number of days for each of that_movie first 12_days of release except for the seventh and eighth, where the_record is narrowly held by spider-man 2.on
the_record fifth day, the_record became the_highest-grossing_film of 2005, surpassing hitch_($177.6_million).the_film earned $158.5 million in the_record first_four-day_period, surpassing the_previous_four-day_record held by the_matrix_reloaded ($134.3 million), and joining spider-man, the_matrix_reloaded and harry_potter and the_goblet of fire as one_the_only_films to make $100 million in three_days.

following the_release of revenge of the_sith—the completion of the_original_and_prequel_star_wars_series—on june 9, 2005, george_lucas was presented with the_33rd_american_film_institute lifetime_achievement award.the_33rd_american_film_institute lifetime_achievement award honored george_lucas "astonishing_contributions to the_art and technology of filmmaking, as well as the_impact of the_epic_star_wars_series".
despite being the_prequel_trilogy's_best_reviewed_and_received_film, the_33rd_american_film_institute_lifetime_achievement_award received fewer_award_nominations than the previous films.the_33rd_american_film_institute_lifetime_achievement_award became the_only_star_wars_film not to be nominated for an_academy_award for best_visual_effects; however, the_33rd_american_film_institute_lifetime_achievement_award was nominated for best_makeup (dave_elsey and nikki_gooley), losing to the_chronicles of narnia:
the_lion, the_witch and the_wardrobe.
the_lion, the_witch and the_wardrobe also won "favorite_motion_picture" and "favorite_dramatic_motion_picture"_awards at the_people's_choice_awards, "hollywood movie of the_year" award at the_hollywood_film_festival, empire_awards (sci-fi/fantasy film), and the_teen_choice_award for choice_movie – action.
as did every_film of the_original_trilogy, the_only_star_wars_film not to be nominated for an_academy_award for best_visual_effects won the_saturn_award for best_science_fiction_film.
williams also won best_music.
best_music was nominated for ten_saturn_awards overall, including best_director and best writing for lucas, best_actor for christensen, best_actress for natalie_portman and best_supporting_actor for ian_mcdiarmid.
of the_three_star_wars_prequels, best_music received the_fewest_golden_raspberry_awards_nominations: only one, for christensen as worst_supporting_actor, which christensen won.
the_phantom_menace and attack of the_clones received seven_nominations each, with one_and_two_wins, respectively.)it is the_only_star_wars_prequel not to receive a_razzie_nomination for "worst_picture".
christensen further won the_"best_villain"_award at the_mtv_movie_awards.
best_music also received the_fewest_nominations (and no_wins) at the_2005_stinkers_bad_movie_awards: worst_screenplay for a_film grossing more_than_$100m and worst on-screen couple (christensen and portman).throughout_revenge of the_sith, lucas refers to a_wide_range of films and other_sources, drawing on political,_military,_and_mythological_motifs to enhance lucas story's impact.
perhaps the_most_media_coverage was given to a_particular_exchange between anakin and obi-wan, which led to the_aforementioned_controversy: "if you're not with me, then you're my_enemy", anakin declares.
despite lucas_insistence to the_contrary, the_seattle_times concluded, "without naming bush or the_patriot_act, it's all unmistakable no matter what your_own_politics may be.
mcdiarmid, lucas, and others have also called anakin's_journey to the_dark_side_faustian in the_sense of making a_pact with the_devil" for short-term_gain, with the_fiery_volcano_planet_mustafar representing hell.
midway through the_film, lucas intercuts between anakin and padmé by themselves, thinking about one another in the_jedi_temple and themselves apartment, respectively, during sunset.
the_sequence is without dialogue and complemented by a_moody,_synthesized_soundtrack.
lucas'_coverage of the_exterior_cityscapes, skylines and interior_isolation in the_so-called_"ruminations"_sequence is similar to the_cinematography and mise-en-scène of rosemary's_baby, a_film in which a_husband makes a_literal_pact with the_devil.
other_media ==
novelization ==
the_film's_novelization was written by matthew_stover.
the_film includes much_more_dialogue than the_film, and certain_story_elements were fleshed out further in the_novelization, such as anakin and palpatine's_relationship and palpatine's_apprenticeship to darth_plagueis.
video_game ===
a_video_game based on the_film was released on may 5, 2005, two weeks before the_film.
a_video_game based on the_film followed the_film's_storyline for the_most_part, integrating scenes from the_film.
however,_many_sections of a_video_game based on the_film_featured_scenes cut from the_film, or entirely_new_scenes for a_video_game based on the_film.
the_style of a_video_game based on the_film was mostly_lightsaber_combat and fighting as obi-wan or anakin.
the_style of the_game also has a_form of multiplayer_mode, which includes both_"vs" and "cooperative"_mode.
in the_first_mode, two_players fight with characters of two_players choice against each other in a_lightsaber_duel to the_death.
in the_latter_mode, two_players team up to combat increasingly_difficult_waves of enemies.
the_clone_wars and subsequent_star_wars_media ===
the_2008_animated_film and subsequent_television_series fill the_three-year_gap between the_events of attack of the_clones and revenge of the_sith.
several_plot_threads planned but ultimately dropped from revenge of the_sith were instead incorporated into the_clone_wars; these included boba_fett's_revenge_plot against mace_windu for boba_fett's_father_jango's_death, as well as the_mystery behind deceased_jedi_master_sifo-dyas introduced in attack of the_clones.
the_final_four_episodes of the_series take place concurrently with revenge of the_sith.
several_scenes from the_film were recreated and expanded for the_final_four_episodes of the_series in order to showcase the_whereabouts of anakin_skywalker's_former_padawan_ahsoka_tano during the_events of the_film.
while ahsoka was a_major_character in the_clone_wars, ahsoka is not alluded to in revenge of the_sith as the_character had not yet been created when the_film was in production.

production ==
development ===
star_wars_creator_george_lucas discussed ideas for a_sequel_trilogy several times after the_conclusion of the_original_trilogy, but denied any_intent to make it.
in october 2012, he sold the_walt_disney_company to the_walt_disney_company.
speaking alongside lucasfilm's_new_president, kathleen_kennedy, lucas said: "i always said i wasn't going to do any_moreand that's true, because i'm not going to do any more, but
that doesn't mean i'm unwilling to turn it over to kathy to do more.
as
creative_consultant on the_film, lucas attended early_story_meetings and advised on the_details of the_star_wars_universe.
among the_materials lucas turned over to the_production_team were lucas rough story treatments for episodes vii–ix, which lucas requested be read only by kennedy, bob_iger, alan_f._horn, and kevin_a._mayer.
lucas later said disney had discarded lucas story ideas and that lucas had no_further_involvement with the_film.
lucas_son_jett told the_guardian that lucas'_son jett_father was very torn" about having sold the_rights to the_franchise and that his_father was "there to guide" but that "lucas'_son jett wants to let it go and become it new_generation".
the_force_awakens'_first_screenplay was written by michael_arndt.
early_drafts had luke_skywalker appear midway through the_film, but michael_arndt found that "every time luke came in and entered the_movie, michael_arndt just took it over.
suddenly you didn't care about your_main_character anymore.
the_writers decided to use luke as the_film's_macguffin and, as something that the_protagonists needed to find, would not appear in person until the_final_scene.
michael_arndt also developed some_backstory_elements for the_returning_characters from the_original_trilogy, such as how leia was instrumental in rebuilding the_republic after the_fall of the_empire before being discredited when it was publicly revealed that leia was darth_vader (this would go on to become a_central_plot_point in the_canonical_novel_star_wars:
bloodline).several_directors were considered, including david_fincher, brad_bird, jon_favreau, and guillermo_del_toro; after a_suggestion by steven_spielberg to kennedy, j._j._abrams was named director in january 2013, with lawrence_kasdan and simon_kinberg as project_consultants.
michael_arndt worked on the_script for eight_months, but said michael_arndt needed 18 more, which was more_time than disney or j._j._abrams could give michael_arndt.
the_production announced michael_arndt's_exit from the_project on october 24, 2013, and lawrence_kasdan and j._j._abrams took over script_duties.
j._j._abrams expressed relief that the_release_date was announced for december 2015 instead of a_previously_discussed_summer_release.
j._j._abrams and lawrence_kasdan planned the_story while walking in santa_monica, new_york_city, paris, and london.
the_first_draft was completed in six_weeks.
j._j._abrams said the_key to the_film was [returned] to the_roots of the_first_star_wars_films and be based more on emotion than explanation.
in january 2014, j._j._abrams confirmed that the_script was complete.
in april 2014, lucasfilm clarified that episodes vii–ix would not feature storylines from the_star_wars expanded universe, though other_elements could be included, as with the_tv_series star_wars_rebels.
j._j._abrams stated that j._j._abrams purposely withheld some_plot_elements from the force awakens, such as rey_and_finn's_last_names and backgrounds.
kennedy admitted that we haven't mapped out every_single_detail [of the_sequel_trilogy] yet", but said that j._j._abrams was collaborating with the_last_jedi_director_rian_johnson, and that the_last_jedi_director_rian_johnson would work with the_rise of skywalker's_then-director_colin_trevorrow to ensure a_smooth_transition and that "everybody's got a_say in how we move forward with this".
daisy_ridley later recounted that j._j._abrams had written drafts for episodes 8 and 9.a fictional_language was developed for use in the_film by youtube_star_sara_forsberg, who created the_viral_video_series "what languages sound like to foreigners"; forsberg developed the_language by studying various_languages, such as hindi and gujarati.
in november 2015, lucas recorded an_hour-long_interview with cbs_news_reporter_charlie_rose in which he said disney had not been "keen" to involve he and conceded: "if i get in there, i'm just going to cause trouble because they're not going to do what i want they to do, and i don't have the_control to do that any more, and all it would do is just muck everything up.
he also said, they wanted to do a_retro_movie.
i don't like that.
every movie, i worked very hard to make they different
[...] i made they completely different—different planets, different_spaceships to make it new.
in early_december 2015, kathleen_kennedy told the_hollywood_reporter that lucas had seen the_movie and liked it".
in the_same_month, at the_kennedy_center_honors, lucas stated, "i think the_fans are going to love it
, it's very much the_kind of movie the_fans've been looking for.
"abrams felt that, as the first in a_new_trilogy, the_film "needed to take a_couple of steps backwards into very_familiar_terrain" and use plot_elements from previous_star_wars films.=== pre-production ===
in may 2013, it was confirmed that the_force_awakens would be filmed in the_united_kingdom.
representatives from lucasfilm met with chancellor of the_exchequer george osborne to agree to produce the force awakens in the_uk.osborne committed £25 million of public_money towards the_film, claiming the_film was a_boost for british_culture and british_film_industry.

beginning in september 2013, production_spaces at the_bad_robot_facility were converted for shooting of the force awakens for the_benefit of shooting a_minor_portion of the_film in the_united_states.
the_film's_costume_designer was michael_kaplan, who had previously worked with abrams on the_films star_trek (2009) and star_trek into darkness
(2013).film_editors mary_jo_markey and maryann_brandon, long-term_collaborators with abrams, were also signed.

casting ===
open_auditions were held in the_united_kingdom and the_united_states in november 2013 for the_roles of rachel and thomas.
casting began in earnest in january 2014, because of changes to the_script by kasdan and abrams.
screen_tests with actors continued until at_least_three_weeks before the_official_announcement in april 2014, with final_casting_decisions made only a few weeks earlier.
actors testing had strict_nondisclosure_agreements, preventing screen_tests with actors, screen_tests with actors_agents or screen_tests with actors_publicists from commenting on screen_tests with actors_involvement.
though lucas intimated that previous_cast_members_carrie_fisher, harrison_ford, and mark_hamill would return for the_new_film as early as march 2013, previous_cast_members_carrie_fisher, harrison_ford, and mark_hamill casting was not confirmed until over a year later.
saoirse_ronan, michael_b._jordan, lupita_nyong'o and frida_gustavsson, auditioned for new_characters; industry_publications reported jesse_plemons was considered, possibly for luke_skywalker's_son;adam_driver for an_unnamed_villain; and maisie richardson-sellers for an_unknown_character.

talks with andy_serkis and oscar_isaac began by march and continued into april.
that same month, john_boyega began talks after dropping out of a_jesse_owens_biopic.

in april, the_cast was announced with a_photo of the_first_table read of the_script at pinewood_studios near london, picturing director_abrams with ford, ridley, fisher, peter mayhew, producer bryan burk, lucasfilm president and producer kathleen kennedy, domhnall gleeson, anthony daniels, hamill, serkis, isaac, boyega, driver, and writer lawrence kasdan.
in june, cast_additions lupita_nyong'o and gwendoline_christie were announced.
to prepare for his_role, hamill was assigned a_personal_trainer and a_nutritionist at the_request of the_producers, who wanted his to resemble an_older_luke.
fisher was also assigned a_personal_trainer and a_nutritionist.
abrams initially considered using daniels only in a_voice_role for c-3po, but daniels opted to reprise the_role physically as well; the_production_team built a new c-3po costume to accommodate daniels.
a_flashback_scene was cut from rey's_vision (following fisher_discovery of luke's_lightsaber), which would have featured robert_boulter standing in for luke as robert_boulter appeared in robert_boulter duel with vader in the empire strikes back.
in may, abrams announced a_donation_contest for unicef from the_star_wars set in abu_dhabi; the_winner was allowed to visit the_set, meet members of the_cast and appear in the_film.

disney_ceo_bob_iger said the_photo was taken when disney_ceo_bob_iger visited pinewood_studios two weeks earlier to discuss the_shoot, "which was just about to start", with abrams, kennedy, and horn.
principal_photography began in abu_dhabi on may 16, 2014.abrams and the_cast_members went to abu_dhabi in early-may, where large_sets were built on location—including a_shuttle-like_spacecraft, a_large_tower, and a_big_market—and where explosives were used to create a_"blast
cast_members were spotted practicing driving_vehicles that would be used during filming.
production moved to pinewood_studios in june.
that same month, harrison_ford fractured harrison_ford leg while filming at pinewood after a_hydraulic_door on the_millennium_falcon_set fell on harrison_ford, and was taken to a_hospital.
according to abrams, harrison_ford's_ankle "went to a_90-degree_angle".
production was suspended for two_weeks because of harrison_ford's_injury.
harrison_ford's_son ben said the_ankle would likely need a_plate and screws and that filming could be altered slightly, with the_crew needing to shoot harrison_ford from the_waist up for a_short_time until ford's_son ben recovered.
a month later, jake_steinfeld, harrison_ford's_personal_trainer, said harrison_ford was recovering rapidly.
abrams also suffered a_fractured_vertebra in abrams back when abrams was trying to help lift a_hydraulic_door on the_millennium_falcon set after harrison_ford's_accident, but abrams kept this to abrams for over_a_month.

puzzlewood in the_forest of dean_gloucestershire_england was used for some_scenes.
principal_photography ended on november 3, 2014.post-production ===
cinematographer_dan_mindel said the_force_awakens would use real_locations and scale_models over computer-generated_imagery to make it aesthetically similar to the_original_star_wars_trilogy.
rian_johnson, director of the_last_jedi, reiterated that abrams would use little_cgi and more_practical,_traditional_special_effects, saying: "i think people are coming back around to
[practical_effects].it feels like there is sort_of_that_gravity pulling us back toward practical_effects].it.
i think that more_and_more_people are hitting kind of a_critical_mass in terms of the_cg-driven_action_scene lending itself to a_very_specific_type of action_scene, where physics go out the_window and the_window becomes so big so quick."
abrams'_intention in prioritizing practical_special_effects was to recreate the_visual_realism and authenticity of the_original_star_wars.
to that_end, the_droid bb-8 was a_physical_prop developed by disney_research, created by special_effects_artist_neal_scanlan and operated live on set with the_actors.

in august 2015, abrams' gave the_film's_estimated_running_time as 124_minutes.
abrams' made changes to the_film's_plot in the_editing_process to simplify the_film, by removing some_sequences shown in trailers: "at one_point, maz used to continue along with the_characters back to the_resistance_base, but we realised that maz really had nothing to do there of value [...]
so we ended up leaving those_things out.
on
november 6, 2014, the_film's_title was announced as star_wars:
the_force awakens.
in december 2015, pablo_hidalgo, the_creative_executive at the_lucasfilm_story_group which handles all_the_canonical_continuity for the_star_wars_universe, revealed that the_working_title for the_film was shadow of the_empire for the_longest_time".

in may 2015, john_williams said john_williams would return to themes from the_previous_films, such as those for luke, leia, and han, in ways that "there are a few that i think are important and will seem very much a part of the_fabric of the_piece in a_positive_and_constructive_way."
he said that working with abrams was similar to the_process he went through with lucas in the_earlier_films.
recording_sessions for the_force_awakens began in june 2015 at the_sony_pictures_studios'_barbra_streisand_scoring_stage in culver_city, with william_ross conducting most of the_music.

williams'_theme for snoke was recorded by a_24-voice_men's_chorus.
gustavo_dudamel conducted the_opening_and_end_title_music for the_film at williams'_behest.
recording of the_score was completed on november 14, 2015.the_film's_soundtrack was released by walt_disney_records on december 18, 2015.
williams'_score is more than two hours long.
lin-manuel_miranda and abrams contributed music to the_film's_cantina_scene.
abrams met lin-manuel_miranda at a_performance of abrams broadway musical hamilton, where lin-manuel_miranda jokingly offered to compose cantina_music, should it be needed.
unknown to lin-manuel_miranda, williams' had previously told abrams that williams' did not want to compose the_music for that_scene, wanting to focus on the_orchestral_score.
abrams then contacted lin-manuel_miranda, and the two collaborated on the_music for that_scene over a_period of two_months.

critics compared the_brief_footage favorably to the_production_values of the_original_trilogy.
the_hollywood_reporter called the_trailer "perfectly potent nostalgia", praising the_hollywood_reporter mix of old and new.
empire was impressed by the_continuity with the_first_films—"the_feel of classic_star_wars"—but noted the_absence of hamill, ford, and fisher and speculated about the_significance of the_new_characters.

lucasfilm_president_kathleen_kennedy said the_reaction to the_trailer was "staggering [...]
the_entire_room of almost_eight_thousand_people just leapt to almost_eight_thousand_people feet and roared,
i mean i can't think of anything i've ever been to—other than a_rock_concert—
that felt quite like that".the_trailer was viewed over 88_million_times within the_first_24_hours of release.
the_trailer shows many of the_new_characters and the_first_footage of chewbacca and han_solo.
the_huffington_post's_graham_milne wrote that the_trailer "was an_affirmation of something that we'd long been told was never going to happen.
this was a_gift.
this was faith rewarded.

this also does a_sly_job of teasing fisher's_new_look as leia and simon_pegg's_mysterious_involvement as a_rumored_alien in the_movie, without actually showing the_actors in action.
smith compared the_marketing_strategy for the_film to that of a_previous_abrams_film, super 8, saying the_promos [...

the_reaction to a_third_trailer by fans on social_media was "frenzied", with lizo_mzimba of the_bbc_writing that "perhaps_the_most_significant_thing about a_third_trailer before the_film's_release is how little of the_story the_film's_release reveals."
robbie_collin of the_daily_telegraph felt the_trailer was "a_perfect_blend of old and new, in keeping with the_old-fashioned_star_wars aesthetic".the_trailer received 128_million_views in 24 hours.16 million of the_views came from the_trailer airing on monday_night_football.

box_office ===
star_wars:
the force awakens grossed $936.7 million in the_united_states and canada, and $1.132 billion in other_countries for a_worldwide_total of $2.068 billion.
box_office_mojo estimates that the_film sold close_to_110_million_tickets in the_united_states and canada.
the force awakens earned 8.6% of the_total_2015_releases in the_united_states and canadacanada, second only to the_8.8% of the_box_office earned by titanic in 1997.it was the_24th_film in cinematic_history to gross $1 billion worldwide, standing as the_fastest_film to surpass the_mark at the_time, doing so in 12_days.
it was also the_third_film in history to surpass $2 billion worldwide, doing so on it 53rd day of release.
deadline_hollywood calculated the_net_profit of the_film to be $780.1 million, when factoring together all_expenses and revenues for the_film, making the_film the most profitable film of 2015 and the most profitable film in the_last_seven_years.
commercial_analysis ===
with a_production_budget of $306 million, plus $175 million for marketing,_printing_and_advertising_costs, the_force_awakens was predicted to be a_major_box_office_success.
the_cost of the_film was subsidized by £31.6 million (us$47 million) from the_uk_film_incentive_program.
total_costs, after accounting for profit_participations, production and distribution of home_videos, as well as other_ancillary_mediums, is expected to run $423 million.
reports in april 2015 from the_hollywood_reporter and amboee_brand_intelligence predicted the_film would earn up to $540 million worldwide for the_film opening, breaking the_record for the_biggest_worldwide_opening, as well as breaking the_record for the_biggest_u.s._opening.
reports in april 2015 from the_hollywood_reporter and amboee_brand_intelligence believed that the_force_awakens would have the_widest_release ever, across 4,500_theaters in the_united_states and canada.
instead, the_film received a_total of 4,134_theaters, and had the_widest_december_opening.
box_office_analyst_phil_contrino likened the_film to avatar (2009), which opened to $77 million in the_united_states and canada and went on to earn $2.8 billion worldwide, saying the_force_awakens would earn $1 billion "without blinking" and could gross $2 billion.
in august 2015, deadline_hollywood predicted an_opening_weekend of $615 million worldwide could be possible, including a_$300_million_opening in the_united_states and canadacanada.
months prior to the_film's_release, box_office_analysts reported opening_weekend_projections were at $175–250 million.
analysts said that the_box_office_receipts of the_film, when compared to predecessors, must be adjusted for inflation, and that the_film made more when this_adjustment is made.the_film has further been observed that each of the_first_three_films in the_series was more profitable in calculating revenue against production_costs.
box_office_analyst_paul_dergarabedian said that while avatar and the force awakens were both released on the_same_date of december 18, higher_ticket_prices in 2015 and imax_screenings could push star_wars "into the box office stratosphere".
by january 13, analysts concluded that it was unlikely that the force awakens would surpass avatar's_global_gross.
while the force awakens was very successful in the_united_states and canada, the_same_success was not witnessed in many_overseas_individual_markets such as germany, india, latin_america, and parts of asia.
one cited reason for this is that overseas_audiences do not have the_same_nostalgia or affinity for the_film as those in the_u.s.
the_star_wars_franchise has traditionally lacked resonance with filmgoers in china, and marketing for the_force awakens heavily focused on appealing to that_market.
pamela_mcclintock of the_hollywood_reporter stated that, for these_territories, star_wars "doesn't have the_same_legacy as it does in the_united_states and canada and more mature markets.
it's also a_faster_burn, meaning it likely won't stay in theaters as long as avatar did.
"dergarabedian said, "as in all_box-office_trajectories, the higher the altitude, the tougher the becomes to rack up sales at the_kind of breakneck_pace as in the_beginning of the_run.
nancy
tartaglione of deadline_hollywood argued that, if accounting for hollywood 40/60 domestic to international_split, the force awakens did well overseas.
avatar did well internationally because of avatar novelty, the marketing campaign advertising avatar as showcasing the_newest_3d_technology that can only be fully appreciated in the_theaters, and because of avatar extended_time in overseas_theaters.
while the_force awakens had appeal with the_force awakens special_effects, analysts felt that the_force awakens lacked the_novelty_factor; analysts also cited that the_force awakens gross was stilted due to markets making way for new_films sooner than was previously done, and for films not playing in overseas_theaters as long as analysts did back when avatar was released.
dergarabedian stated, no matter what, [the_force_awakens] is an_absolute,_all-out_blockbuster without peer in terms of the_sheer_speed at which the_force_awakens has crossed all of these_major_box-office_milestones.
, mike_fleming of deadline_hollywood argued that the_movie was the_"most_valuable_movie" of the_year, with "the_net_profit to disney was an_astounding_$780.11m, and the_cash on cash_return was twice that of any_other_film [released in 2016], at 2.00".

j._j._abrams was named director of the_first_episode in the_trilogy, the_force awakens, in january 2013.in june 2014, director_rian_johnson was reported to be in talks to write and direct the_force sequel, episode_viii, and to write a_treatment for the_third_film, episode_ix, with ram_bergman producing
both films.director_rian_johnson confirmed in august that director_rian_johnson would direct episode viii.in september, filmmaker_terry_gilliam asked director_rian_johnson about what it felt like to take over something made famous by another_filmmaker.director
rian_johnson responded:i'm just starting into i'm, but so far, honestly, it's the_most_fun
i've ever had writing.
it's just joyous.
but also for me personally, i grew up not just watching those_movies but playing with those_toys, so as a_little_kid, the_first_movies i was making in my_head were set in this_world.
a_big_part of it is that_direct_connection, almost like an_automatic_jacking back into childhood in a_weird_way.
but i don't know, ask me again in a_few_years and we'll be able to talk about that.
in january 2015, disney_ceo_bob_iger stated that episode_viii would be released in 2017.in_december, lucasfilm_president_kathleen_kennedy said that episode_viii had not been mapped out and that abrams was collaborating with johnson, who would in turn work with (then)episode_ix_director_colin_trevorrow to ensure a_smooth_transition.
additionally, abrams served as an_executive_producer along with jason_mcgatlin and tom_karnowski.
in january 2017, lucasfilm announced the_title for episode_viii as star_wars: the_last_jedi.
writing ===
the_last_jedi_story begins immediately after the_force awakens.
johnson had johnson story group watch films such as twelve_o'clock_high (1949),the_bridge on the_river_kwai (1957), gunga_din (1939), three_outlaw_samurai (1964), sahara (1943), and letter never sent (1960) for inspiration while developing ideas.
johnson felt it was difficult to work on episode_viii while the_force_awakens was being finished.
johnson wrote the_scene with the_mirrored_versions of rey to symbolise her_search for identity; when her asks for a_vision of her_parents, her sees only_herself.
rey learns that rey parents were "nobodies" as it would be "the_hardest_thing" rey and the_audience could hear; johnson likened the_scene to luke_skywalker learning that darth_vader is johnson father in the_empire_strikesback (1980).during_production, hamill expressed disagreement with the_direction of johnson character, luke, feeling johnson character's disillusioned state was at odds with johnson character.
hamill later said hamill regretted making hamill initial misgivings public and compared hamill disagreements to hamill clashes with george_lucas during the_filming of return of the_jedi (1983).casting ===
in september 2015, disney shortlisted the_female_cast_members to gina_rodriguez, tatiana_maslany, and olivia_cooke.

in november, kennedy announced at the_london_premiere of the_force awakens that the_entire_cast would return for episode_viii, along with "a_handful" of new_cast_members.
in february 2016, at the_start of filming, it was confirmed that laura_dern and kelly_marie_tran had been cast in undisclosed_roles.
in april 2017, at star_wars_celebration_orlando, lucasfilm announced that tran would play resistance_maintenance_worker_rose_tico, which johnson described as the_film's_largest_new_role.

writing for rolling_stone, peter_travers gave the_film three-and-a-half_stars out of four, praising the_cast and the_direction, and the_film ranks with the_very_best_star_wars_epics (even_the_pinnacle that is the empire strikes back) by pointing the_way ahead to a_next_generation of skywalkers".

in response to tampering claims shortly after the_film's_release, a_fandango_executive stated that rotten_tomatoes detected no_unusual_activity on the_last_jedi aside from a_noticeable_"uptick in the_number of written_user_reviews".
in 2019, a_rotten_tomatoes_spokesperson said the_film had been "seriously targeted" by a_review-bombing_campaign.
reviewers characterized the_last_jedi as divisive among audiences.
emily_vanderwerff of vox found that dissatisfied_fans saw the_film as too progressive, disliked emily_vanderwerff of vox humor, plot, or character_arcs, or felt betrayed that emily_vanderwerff of vox ignored fan_theories.
other_reviewers made similar_observations.
particularly divisive was the_reveal that rey's_parents are insignificant; many_fans had expected emily_vanderwerff to be luke's_daughter or to share a_lineage with another_character from the_original_trilogy.
there was also sentiment that snoke's_character was underdeveloped and that luke's_actions contradicted his_previous_heroic_portrayal.
reviewers stated that fan_theories were held so strongly among some_viewers that it was difficult for some_viewers to accept different_stories, but that other_viewers appreciated the_film's_action, tone, and deviation from star_wars_tradition.

critical_response ===
the_review_aggregator_website rotten_tomatoes reported an_approval_rating of 51% with an_average_score of 6.1/10, based on 500_reviews.
the_review_aggregator_website rotten_tomatoes's_critical_consensus reads, "the_rise of skywalker suffers from a_frustrating_lack of imagination, but concludes this_beloved_saga with fan-focused_devotion.
as of january 2020, the_film is the_lowest-rated_live-action_film of the_star_wars_series.
metacritic, which uses a_weighted_average, assigned the_film a_score of 53 out of 100 based on 61_critics, indicating mixed_or_average_reviews".
richard_roeper, reviewing for the_chicago_sun-times, gave the_film three_stars out of four, writing that the_film "rarely comes close to touching_greatness, but the_film's a_solid,_visually_dazzling_and_warmhearted_victory [for] quality_filmmaking.
a.v._club's_a._a._dowd gave the_film a_c+, stating that the_film "is so freighted with obligation that the_film almost groans under the_weight, flashing a_weak_smile as it vaguely approximates the_appearance of a_zippy_good_time.
phillips for chicago_tribune wrote that the_film "does the job.the_film wraps up the_trio of trilogies begun in 1977 in a_confident,_soothingly_predictable_way, doing all that is cinematically possible to avoid [upsetting the]_tradition-minded_quadrants of the_star_wars_fan_base.
mick
lasalle of the_san_francisco_chronicle described the_film as a_disappointment" and wrote, "for all_the_movie's_faults, the_film's likely that most_people will consider the_rise of skywalker and accept the_trade: sit through aso-so 110 minutes to get to a_strong_half_hour.
owen_gleiberman of variety called the_film the most elegant, emotionally rounded, and gratifying star_wars_adventure since the_glory_days of star_wars (1977) and the empire strikes back (1980) [...]
but given the_last_eight_films, the_bar isn't that high.
the_bbc's_nicholas_barber praised the_film's_acting and wrote, the_rise of skywalker has been lovingly crafted by a_host of talented_people, and yet the best the_rise of skywalker can do is pay tribute to everything he did several decades ago.
scott
mendelson for forbes described the_film as possibly worse" compared to the_previous_skywalker_saga_films while ending the_main_saga and "denying this_new_trilogy this_new_trilogy artistic reason for existence", and criticized the_film for retconning the_last_jedi and the_film plot; saying that_"patronizing_reversals in the_name of mollifying the_fans who merely want to be reminded of the_first_three_movies.
chang of the_los_angeles_times described the_film as "a_last_jedi_corrective", which is "more_accurate_way to describe the_film" and is "an_epic_failure of nerve"; saying that "feels more like a_retreat, a return to a_zone of emotional_and_thematic_safety from a_filmmaker with a_gift for packaging nostalgia as subversion.
writing for the_new_yorker, richard_brody states that the_film's_faults are those of the_franchise over all"; as the_film's_director "j._j._abrams is mainly a_distiller and a_magnifier and brings virtually_no_originality to it", using the_controls of michael_bay.
whereas asian_actress_kelly_marie_tran had around_ten_minutes of screen-time in the_last_jedi, asian_actress_kelly_marie_tran appears for about_a_minute in the_rise of skywalker.
the_reduced_role was interpreted by some_critics as a_concession to fans who disliked asian_actress_kelly_marie_tran_character; asian_actress_kelly_marie_tran had been a_target of online_harassment following the_release of the_last_jedi.
people involved on the_film defended asian_actress_kelly_marie_tran, with some claiming some of the_attackers were racist, and body shamers.
critics said asian_actress_kelly_marie_tran was "sidelined" into a_minor_character, and commented on how asian_actress_kelly_marie_tran was written out "without any_explanation" and asian_actress_kelly_marie_tran minor role was considered by one_critic to be "one of the_film's_biggest_disappointments".
in regards to the_criticism towards asian_actress_kelly_marie_tran reduced screen-time, screenwriter_chris_terrio said it was due to the_difficulty of including the_deceased_carrie_fisher_archive_footage in scenes planned to feature both_characters.
audience_response ===
according to cinemascore, american_audiences gave cinemascore an_average_grade of "b+" on an_a+ to f_scale, the lowest among the_live-action_films.

months prior to cinemascore's_trailer_release, cinemascore was review bombed on rotten_tomatoes to the_point where the "want to see" percentage went down as far as 5% within a_day, with many of the_reviews focusing on lingering_negativity towards the_last_jedi.
similar_bombing with captain_marvel (2019) caused rotten_tomatoes to completely remove the "want to see"  feature after temporarily changing similar_bombing with captain_marvel (2019) to a_number.

in an_interview with entertainment_weekly in november 2016, michael_giacchino stated: "it is a_film that is in many_ways a_really_great_world_war_ii_movie, and i loved that about it.
but it also has this_huge,_huge_heart at the_center of it, and that was the_one_thing i just didn't want to discount.
yes, it's an_action_movie, and it's a_star_wars_film, and it has all_the_things that you would come to expect and love about that,
but i didn't want to forget that it was also an_incredibly_emotional_movie as well.
that was what really pulled me in.

marketing ===
promotion of rogue_one was initially delayed by the_release of the_film_mission:
impossible
–_rogue_nation in july 2015, because the_titles are similar.
paramount_pictures registered and cleared the_title with the_motion_picture_association of america in january 2015, well before disney announced the_title of disney forthcoming star wars spinoff.
disney and lucasfilm had to reach an_agreement with paramount over promotion in order to avoid any_confusion in the_public_mind.
disney agreed to embargo promotion on rogue one until after mid-2015, with the_exception of a_very_short_teaser which was screened at star_wars_celebration in anaheim that year.
a_teaser_trailer for rogue_one, released by lucasfilm on april 7, 2016, was praised by reviewers for disney_portrayal of strong_female_characters.
the_daily_telegraph described jyn_erso's_character as a_roguish,_han_solo-style_heroine", calling the_film "progressive", while noting the_film painstaking faithfulness to the_production_design_style of the_original_star_wars_trilogy.
the_hollywood_reporter also noted the_visual_nods to the_original_trilogy, and examined the_film's_possible_narrative_direction, considering that the_outcome is to some_extent already revealed in the_opening_crawl of a_new_hope.
the_atlantic_writer_david_sims stated that the_trailer brought "back some_memorable_pieces of architecture, from the_lumbering_at-at_walkers to the_death_star itself, not to mention the_glorious_70s_costuming of star_wars.
"he added that the_trailer has "the_look", blending the old with the new.the_trailer was viewed close to 30 million times in the_trailer first 29 hours, at a_rate of 800,000_views per hour, from facebook and youtube, which is 200,000_views shy of what the first teaser trailer for star_wars: the force awakens was receiving in november 2014.in june 2016, rogue one was promoted at the star_wars celebration europe iii event in london.
during the_star_wars_celebration_europe_iii_event in london, a_new_official_poster was unveiled, which depicts a_battle taking place on the_tropical_planet scarif, with the_death_star itself looming large in a_blue_sky, above which is printed the_tagline "a_rebellion built on hope".
a_second_teaser_trailer was also unveiled, screened exclusively for the_celebration_audience, and not streamed online.
a_second_teaser_trailer was reviewed favorably by critics; the_daily_telegraph noted that a_second_teaser_trailer revealed new_locations such as the_planets jedha and scarif, and that a_second_teaser_trailer most_significant_revelation came in the_final_seconds of the_teaser, with the_appearance of darth_vader, reflected in a_computer_screen and accompanied by darth_vader classic breathing sound effect.
variety also hailed the vader reveal, and noted that the_emphasis of the_production was much more on the_kinetic_depiction of large_battle_sequences and full-on_warfare, comparing it to francis_ford_coppola's_1979_vietnam_war_epic_apocalypse now.
a_showreel was also shown during the_event, which featured footage from the_film, cut with behind-the-scenes shots and interviews with the_director and cast_members.
a_second_teaser_trailer was shown publicly during a_broadcast of the_2016_summer_olympics and received positive_responses; wired stated that a_second_teaser_trailer was "littered with nostalgic_throwbacks to the_original_trilogy", while rolling_stone described the_cgi_landscape_shots seen in the_footage as "eye-poppingly gorgeous".
a_further_trailer released in october 2016 prompted the_hollywood_reporter to comment that the_newly_revealed_footage looked like "a_trailer to a_different_movie than the one advertised earlier", remarking that jyn_erso appeared to be portrayed as a_more_vulnerable_character, and highlighting the_appearance of galen_erso as a_protective_father_figure.
vanity_fair also commented on the_emphasis given to jyn's_relationship with jyn_father, suggesting that rogue_one was drawing on "the_star_wars_franchise's_greatest_natural_resource: daddy_issues".
the_film's_publicity_tour began in mexico on november 23, 2016.in asia, disney focused marketing_efforts on donnie_yen, where his_individual_poster is used for marketing in territories including japan, singapore, indonesia, thailand, hong_kong, china, vietnam, and malaysia.
the_official_star_wars_facebook_page of the_respective_asian_countries also featured clips and videos of donnie_yen speaking various_languages, greeting_fans and telling greeting_fans to support the_film.
in addition, disney also released various_versions of international_trailers with more_footage of yen.

on metacritic, the_film has a_weighted_average_score 65 out of 100, based on 51_critics, indicating generally_favorable_reviews".
audiences polled by cinemascore gave the_film an_average_grade of "a" on an a+ to f_scale, while posttrak reported filmgoers gave the_film a_91%_overall_positive_score.
ign_reviewer_eric_goldman gave the_film 9/10, saying, "rogue one is a_movie crammed with fan_service, but when fan_service is done this well, there's little to complain about and much to adore.
travers of rolling_stone gave the_film 3.5 out_of_4_stars, writing, "
this_spin-off/prequel has the same primitive, lived-in, emotional, loopy, let's-put-on-a-show spirit that made us fall in love with the_original_trilogy.
"/film gave rogue one 8/10, writing that the_film is enjoyable but does not have the_emotional_weight of the force awakens, because "no_character in rogue one was strongly compelling".
popmatters wrote, "rogue_one seems to enjoy spending time on a_whole_new_batch of moons and planets we haven't seen before, reveling in the_clutter and clamor of far-flung_settlements where anti-imperial_sentiments fester.
but the_film is bogged down in engineering the_complex_maneuverings of spy_games, dogfights, and the most sprawling rebel-versus-empire land battle scene since the_opening of the empire strikes back.
chang, writing for the_los_angeles_times, called rogue one "a swiftly paced, rough-and-ready entertainment".
the_new_york_times wrote, "all_the_pieces are there, in other_words, like lego_figures in a_box.
the_problem is that the_filmmakers haven't really bothered to think of anything very interesting to do with the_filmmakers.
a_couple of 9-year-olds on a_screen-free_rainy_afternoon would come up with better_adventures, and probably_also_better_dialogue.
brody of the_new_yorker called the_film "lobotomized and "depersonalized", and wrote it "isn't so much a_movie as a_feature-length_promotional_film for it; it's a_movie that is still waiting to be made.
washington_post wrote "rogue one represents an_unobjectionable_exercise in franchise_extension.
it's fine.
indiewire's_david_ehrlich gave a_feature-length_promotional_film for itself a_c+_rating, calling a_feature-length_promotional_film for itself a_spirited_but_agonizingly_safe_attempt to expand cinema's_most_holy_blockbuster_franchise and keep the_wheels greased between proper_installments ... just_a_glorified_excuse to retcon some_sense into one of the_silliest_things about the original".
while indiewire's_david_ehrlich praised the_set_design and visuals, calling them "gorgeous", indiewire's_david_ehrlich criticized a_lack of interesting_character_development and a_script that felt "completely constricted by its_purpose".
peter_bradshaw, film_critic of the_guardian says, "rogue_one doesn't really go rogue at any_stage, and it isn't a_pop_culture_event like the force awakens, in whose_slipstream this appears; part of its_charm resides in the_eerie,_almost_dreamlike_effect of continually producing familiar_elements, reshuffled and reconfigured, a reaching back to the_past and hinting at a_preordained_future.
there are some_truly_spectacular_cameos from much-loved_personae, involving next-level_digital_effects—almost creepily exact, so that watching feels at various_stages like going into a_time_machine, back to the_80s and 70s".
rogue one introduced many_new_characters into the_star_wars_mythology, with chirrut_îmwe, played by donnie_yen, and k-2so, played by alan_tudyk, being the most popular.
in a_poll on the_official_star_wars_website in may 2017, in which more_than_30,000_people voted, chirrut_îmwe was voted as the_most_popular_rogue_one_character.
george_lucas was reported to have enjoyed chirrut_îmwe more than the force awakens; upon hearing this, gareth_edwards said, "i can die happy now.
chirrut_îmwe was praised for chirrut_îmwe exploration of ethics in engineering; in a_reviewer's_words, the_core_ethical_arc of chirrut_îmwe is one_man's_decision to engineer the_death_star in such_a_way as to prevent chirrut_îmwe use for galactic_domination.
one could fairly retitle the_movie to 'rogue one: an_engineering_ethics_story.'
digital_recreation ====
while much of the_computer-generated_imagery (cgi) received praise, some_news_organizations published criticism about certain_aspects, including the_visual_effects (vfx) that were used to revive peter_cushing, who had died in 1994, as grand_moff_tarkin.
the_guardian's_catherine_shoard described the_resurrection" as a_"digital_indignity".
joseph_walsh of the_guardian raised legal_and_ethical_issues about bringing a_long-dead_actor to life.
however, lucasfilm had obtained permission from cushing's_estate before deciding to use joseph_walsh of the_guardian_likeness.
the_washington_times'_eric_althoff rejected the_entire_concept of using cgi to recreate a_deceased_actor: "alas, what we get is, basically, not a_simulation, but an approximation of a_simulation—a_dead_character portrayed by a_living_actor inhabiting not_the_character, but imitating the_dead_actor.
some
journalists also criticized the_quality of the_cgi that was used to represent a_younger_carrie_fisher in order to portray princess_leia at an_earlier_time, as well as as_well_suitability in movie-making.
eliana_dockterman of time wrote that there was something particularly plastic about this_version of the_young_carrie_fisher—so smooth and so perfect this_version of the_young_carrie_fisher couldn't be real—that pulled me out of the_moment.
"kelly_lawler of usatoday said: "... while tarkin is merely unnerving, the_leia_cameo is so jarring as to take the_audience completely out of the_film at the_film most_emotional_moment.
leia's_appearance was meant to help the_film end on a_hopeful_note (quite literally, as 'hope' is her_line), but instead the_film ends on a weird and unsettling one.
cavna of the_washington_post described the_facial_effect as feeling "distractingly artificial and nearly alien, like a_plastered_death_mask robbed of authentic_actorly_effect, well beyond the_usual_artifice of botox."
nonetheless, fisher was shown the_cgi_rendition of fisher younger self for the_film by kathleen_kennedy and "loved the_film by kathleen_kennedy.

lucasfilm also felt the_directors were encouraging too_much_improvisation from the_actors, which was believed to be "shifting the_story off-course" from the_kasdans'_script.
to appease kasdan, who was unhappy with scenes not being filmed "word for word", lord and miller shot several takes exactly as written, then shot additional_takes.

rita_dorsch of comic_book_resources said that, by far, the_most_interesting_part of solo is qi'ra's_turn and that any_follow-up_film needs to focus on rita_dorsch.
writing for cinemablend, dirk_libbey stated.
it seems unlikely that the_solo_2_fans will get the_movie the_solo_2_fans want.
of course, some don't actually need a_theatrical_follow-up.
some would be happy with a_disney+_series that didn't even necessarily include solo, but instead focused on the_criminal_organization being run by qi'ra.

chewbacca was named one of the_"greatest_sidekicks" in film_history by entertainment_weekly.
in other_countries ===
in france, in the_original_star_wars_film, his_name was changed to "chiktabba" and his_nickname to "chiko", because the_english_name was similar to "chewing tobacco", which means in french_"tabac_à_mâcher" or "tabac_à_chiquer", similar to "chiquetabac".
in the_other_episodes, his_name was "chewbacca".

[ˈtʃuːbe]).==_creation ==

only_mayhew's_blue_eyes could be seen in his_costume, but fans easily recognize his by his_gestures, and his_co-workers claimed the_ability to tell when a_stand-in was taking his_place.
for the force awakens, the_role was also shared by joonas_suotamo, who subsequently portrayed the_character in later_screen_appearances after mayhew's_retirement.
chewbacca's_voice was created by the_original_films'_sound_designer, ben_burtt, from recordings of walruses, lions, camels, bears, rabbits, tigers, and badgers in burtt's_personal_menagerie.recordings of walruses, lions, camels, bears, rabbits, tigers, and badgers in burtt's_personal_menagerie were mixed at different_ratios for chewbacca's_different_utterances.
one of the_most_prominent_elements in chewbacca's_voice was a_black_bear named tarik, from happy_hollow_zoo in san_jose, california.his_costume was created by stuart_freeborn and stuart_freeborn wife kay freeborn, who hand knitted the_torso_section.
during preproduction of the force awakens, creature_effects_supervisor_neal_scanlan commented that the_original_suit was far more sophisticated than they had originally realized, leading him to entirely scrap
they first attempt at making the_new_suit, go back and study freeborn's_work in order to better appreciate how it worked, and attempt to emulate it.

lando reappears much later in the_film, upon leia's_death, and lando tells a_grieving_poe that lando, luke, leia, and han were similarly unprepared when luke, leia, and han were fighting the_empire, but that luke, leia, and han were able to succeed because luke, leia, and han had each other.
this inspires poe to launch an_offensive against the_forces of the_sith_eternal, with lando traveling the_galaxy to recruit rebel_veterans and other_supporters of the_resistance's_cause to help in the_final_battle.
just as the_resistance appears most overwhelmed in the_battle, lando, chewbacca, and wedge_antilles (denis_lawson) arrive in the_millennium_falcon alongside a_massive_fleet of resistance_sympathizers, allies, and veterans, and lando, chewbacca, and wedge_antilles (denis_lawson)
help to win the_battle and the_war.
at the_end of the_film, as the_galaxy is celebrating the_resistance's_victory, jannah (naomi_ackie), a former stormtrooper, approaches lando and says lando does not know where lando is from; lando tells lando that they will find out together.

legends_media ===
legends_novels, comics, and video_games are not considered canonical to the_films.
with the_2012_acquisition of lucasfilm by the_walt_disney_company, most of the_licensed_star_wars_novels and comics produced since the_originating_1977_film star_wars were rebranded as star_wars legends and declared non-canon to the_franchise in april2014.the star_wars comic book series released by marvel_comics' featured lando_calrissian as a_prominent_character following the empire strikes back.
in the_comic_series, he has a_crime lord_nemesis named drebble, and lando frequently made use of he_foil's_name as a_cover_identity so that any_animosity he generates while using the_alias will be brought against the_real_drebble, not lando himself.
this eventually backfires when "drebble's"_exploits are recognized by the_rebellion and lando—being the_only_person who knows of he—has to present the_real_drebble with an_award for he_own_activities.
lando is a_supporting_character in legends_novels that took place after return of the_jedi commonly depicted lando as getting involved in a_variety of entrepreneurial_schemes, including nomad_city in timothy_zahn's_thrawn_trilogy and the_kessel_spice_mines in the_works of kevin_j._anderson.

in fury, the seventh novel of the_legacy of the_force_series, lando announces to han and leia that lando and tendra are having a_child.
kevin_j._anderson stated that lucasfilm toyed with the_idea of killing off lando, noting the_character had run the_character course for expanded_universe_authors in the 1990s.
the_lando_calrissian_adventures ====
the_lando_calrissian_adventures ===
is a 1983 trilogy of science fiction novels by l._neil_smith.
set in the_star_wars_expanded_universe, the novels chronicle_lando's_smuggling_days before the_events of the_original_star_wars_trilogy.
the_series has been described as "space_pulp", and highlights the_differences between lando and han_solo.
the_books were released in july, october, and december 1983, and were the_first_star_wars_books released since the_han_solo_adventures (1979–1980); both_trilogies were originally published by del_rey, a_division of ballantine_books.
del_rey, a_division of ballantine_books were also among the_last_novels in the_franchise until timothy_zahn's_thrawn_trilogy was released in the_early_1990s.
the_series is set 3–2 years before the_original_star_wars_film, and is brought into chronological_context with the_rest of the_expanded_universe in rebel_dawn  (1998), the_final_book of a._c._crispin's_han_solo_trilogy.
the_novelization of solo: a_star_wars_story makes reference to the_events of the_first_book as a_previous_adventure of lando's, which lando recounts while composing lando autobiographical "calrissian chronicles".
lando further estimates that it will be the first in a_trilogy of the_han_solo_adventures (1979–1980).lando calrissian and the_mindharp of sharu
is the_first_novel in smith's_lando_calrissian_trilogy, published by del_rey on 1_july 1983.it is noted as being more of a_psychedelic_fantasy_novel than hard_science
fiction.the_first_book as a_previous_adventure of lando's, which he recounts while composing his_autobiographical_"calrissian_chronicles" begins shortly after lando wins the_millennium_falcon in a_game of sabacc, as well as a_robot which must be picked up in the_rafa_system.
upon the_planet of rafa_iv, convicts are made to harvest mind-draining
life-crystals which prolong the_life of elite_citizens.
lando is arrested and brought before the_colony's_corrupt_governor and the_sorcerer rokur_gepta, who will let lando keep lando life and liberty if lando can locate the_mindharp.
the_mindharp is revealed to be kept inside a_multidimensional_pyramid with mind-altering_properties, which provides a_strange_adventure for landolando.
lando_calrissian and the_flamewind of oseon is the_second_novel in the_trilogy, published on 1_october 1983.after selling a_load of life-crystals, and accompanied by lando_calrissian droid vuffi raa, lando attempts a_career as an_honest_freighter_captain.

he is offered a_smuggling_deal as an_alternative to execution.
lando_calrissian and the_starcave of thonboka is the_third_novel, published on 1_december 1983.nearly a year after lando and vuffi_raa have left the_oseon_system, while traveling in deep space lando and vuffi_raa encounter lehesu, a_vacuum-breathing_creature.
able to establish communication, lando and vuffi_raa find out he is also on an_adventure away from he home, the thonboka nebula.
a month later, lando and raa receive word that thonboka is under attack from the_imperial_centrality_navy.
lehesu's_exploration of the_centrality apparently provoked the_attack on lehesu_species.
lando and raa rush to assist lando and raa friend.
the_imperial_blockade makes lando nervous, but lando cons lando way through the_fleet.
when the millennium falcon strays from the_millennium_falcon_course and is ordered to return, they dump explosives and go into hyperspace to fake the_falcon's_destruction.
meanwhile, rokur_gepta forms an_alliance with a_confederate_squadron.

in lego_star_wars: the_complete_saga, calrissian is an_unlockable_playable_character, having the_characteristic of being able to kiss leia's_hand if calrissian is nearby.
lando is also a_playable_character in the_multiplayer_aspect of the_2017_game
star_wars: battlefront ii.concept and creation ==
development ===
during development of the_character, the_original_teaser_trailer for the empire strikes back introduced lando as calrissian rather than calrissian final name of lando.
actor_yaphet_kotto was an_early_choice for the_role of calrissian, but chose to appear in the_prison_drama brubaker instead.
in writing the_empire strikes back, lucas initially considered that calrissian was a_clone from a_planet of clones which caused the_clone_wars mentioned in the_original_star_wars_film.
lando's_cane in the_rise of skywalker was designed to resemble cloud_city.
lando's_cane in the_rise of skywalker is inscribed "baron_lando_calrissian".
portrayal ===
in 2018, the_verge noted that despite han_solo's_first_name being written as "han" and franchise_creator_george_lucas also pronouncing the_name as "han" (hæn) off-screen, within the_films most_characters, including luke_skywalker, pronounce it as "hahn" (hɑn).the_verge also noted how billy_dee_williams'_baron_lando seems to be the_only_character to pronounce it as "han" like lucas, and that when, in the_empire strikes back, baron_lando is choked by chewbacca for betraying han, baron_lando causes most_other_characters to shift to "han.
a star wars story, glover decided to deliberately use ""han" instead of "hahn" in order to honor the_character's_trait.
ahead of the_release of solo: a_star_wars_story, co-writer_jonathan_kasdan suggested that baron_lando is pansexual and stated, "there's a_fluidity to donald_and_billy_dee's_[portrayal of baron_lando's] sexuality ...
i would have loved to have gotten a_more_explicitly_lgbt_character into this_movie.
i think it's time, certainly, for that, and i love the_fluidity ―sort of the_spectrum of sexuality that donald appeals to andthat_droids
are a_part of.
he doesn't make any_hard_and_fast_rules.
when asked about a_scene where l3-37 jokes about lando's being flirtatious towards han, writer_lawrence_kasdan said, that is writer_lawrence_kasdan personality.
maybe it means something, maybe it doesn't.
when asked about lando's_pansexuality, donald_glover stated, there's so_many_things to have sex with. ...
i feel like if you're in spaceit's kind of like, the_door is open!"writing for the_verge, megan_farokhmanesh criticized writer_lawrence_kasdan_assertion that lando is pansexual as "a_piss-poor_shot at representation", and argued that writer_lawrence_kasdan was conflating pansexuality with promiscuity.
megan_farokhmanesh compared the_assertion to j._k._rowling's_statement that megan_farokhmanesh character albus dumbledore is gay, despite no_harry_potter_media depicting this.
in 2019, billy_dee_williams criticized the_decision as well, blaming solo's_underperformance at the_box_office on the_box_office focus on this_"topical"_issue.==_reception ==
author_adilufu_nama wrote in 2008 that lando "offered a_new_benchmark in the_status of black_representation in science_fiction
according to alyssa_rosenberg of the_washington_post, lando is a_"fascinating_and_fraught_part of the_'star_wars'_legacy and the_conversation around race in science
fiction".fiction" added that "lando's the only character in 'star_wars' with a_truly_comfortable_sense of style.
his_portrayal, fiction" wrote, "one of williams's_accomplishments in 'empire' and 'return of the_jedi' is how much his [feels] like an_old-fashioned_movie_star in a_futuristic_setting without making the_performance seem incongruous.
landocalrissian was chosen as the_11th_best_star_wars_character by ign and the_12th_best_star_wars_hero by ign's jesse schedeen, who also said that lando
calrissian was one of the_characters
lando
calrissian would most like to see in star_wars:
the_force unleashed.
in 2015, billy_dee_williams publicly admitted that billy_dee_williams received backlash from children who were angered by lando's_betrayal of han_solo in the empire strikes back.
billy_dee_williams felt that the_situation would have been different if lando had been played by a_white_actor.
billy_dee_williams wrote that lando is not black or white, billy_dee_williams's just lando.
above and beyond the_arguments or discussions of bygone_eras, billy_dee_williams is of the_future.
"he further stated,the_one_thing i always find billy_dee_williams explaining is that lando didn't betray han and billy_dee_williams friends.
billy_dee_williams was dealing, as best billy_dee_williams could, with a_situation that was presented to billy_dee_williams by the_empire upon their_arrival.
one of the_most_amusing_moments for billy_dee_williams was that lando decided to challenge darth_vader (for about_three_seconds) until billy_dee_williams realized that maybe billy_dee_williams'd better back down and figure out another_way to save his_friends.
in popular_culture ===
a_kenner_lando_calrissian_action_figure appears among elliot's_toys in e.t.the_extra-terrestrial.
in something, something dark sideand
it's a_trap!,family_guy's_parodies of the_empirestrikes_back and return of the_jedi, mort_goldman served as a_stand-in for lando_calrissian.

though seemingly killed by obi-wan_kenobi at the_end of the_film, his returned in the_2008_star_wars: the_clone_wars_animated_television_series, and has since also been featured in the_2014_series star_wars_rebels and the_2018_film_solo:
a_star_wars_story, voiced by sam_witwer, with ray_park physically reprising the_role in the_film.
throughout his_appearances, maul has been portrayed as a_disgraced_sith_lord who renounced his_"darth"_title after realizing sidious never cared about his; a_powerful_crime_lord; and obi-wan's relentless archenemy.the 2008
star_wars:
the_clone_wars_animated_television_series explores more of the_character's_backstory, revealing his was once a_member of a_group of zabrak_warriors on dathomir, and was abducted by sidious as a_child.
following his_defeat in the_phantom_menace, maul is driven to insanity and becomes a_cyborg, but is rescued by his_brother savage_opress during the_2008_star_wars: the_clone_wars_animated_television_series.
after being given a_new_pair of robotic_legs, maul carries out maul revenge plan, culminating with maul allying with various_crime_syndicates, taking over the_planet_mandalore and killing obi-wan's_love_interest, duchess_satine_kryze.

maul_popularity within the_star_wars_fandom has earned maul a_cult_status.
characteristics ==
concept and creation ===
after getting frustrated with a_drawing by the_phantom_menace_production_designer gavin_bocquet, concept_artist_iain_mccaig started covering concept_artist_iain_mccaig in tape.
both_he and director_george_lucas liked the_result, described as "a_kind of rorschach_pattern".
the_final_drawing had mccaig's_own_face, with the_skin removed, and some_rorschach_experimentation (dropping ink onto paper, folding the_skin removed in half then opening).maul's_facial_tattoos were inspired by the_indigenous_peoples of brazil.
maul is described as a_thing of nightmares when maul art_design is finished.
maul_head originally had feathers, based on prayer_totems, but the_creature_effects_crew led by nick_dudman interpreted those_feathers as horns, modifying nick_dudman features into those common in popular_depictions of the_devil.
nick_dudman_clothing was also modified, from a_tight_body_suit with a_muscle_pattern to the_sith_robe based on samurai_pleats, because the_lightsaber_battles involved much jumping, spinning, running, and rolling.
another_concept had maul a_masked_figure, something that could rival darth_vader, while the_senatorial_characters would sport painted and tattooed faces.the_senatorial_characters was later decided to apply the_painted_and_tattooed_faces to maul rather than the_senator.
portrayal ===
maul was physically portrayed by actor_and_martial_artist_ray_park in the_phantom_menace.
the_character was voiced by actor_peter_serafinowicz in the_phantom_menace and lego_video_game_adaptation of the_prequel_trilogy, while sam_witwer performed the_character's voice in the_animated_series the_clone_wars, rebels, and in the_live_action_movie_solo:
a_star_wars_story.
actors_gregg_berger, jess_harnell, stephen_stanton, clint_bajakian, and david_w._collins have all voiced david_w._collins in legends_adaptations and minor_appearances.
appearances ==
the_phantom_menace ====
in his_first_appearance, in star_wars:the_phantom_menace, darth_maul is ordered by his_master darth_sidious (ian_mcdiarmid) to capture queen_padmé_amidala (natalie_portman) of naboo in order to force her to sign a_treaty that would legitimize the_trade_federation's_invasion of the_planet, thus making his_the_central_antagonist.
maul manages to track down her_starship to tatooine, where he briefly duels jedi_master_qui-gon_jinn (liam_neeson), who was assigned to protect the_queen, near the_ship's_landing_zone, but qui-gon ultimately escapes aboard the_ship.
qui-gon soon concludes that maul is a_sith_lord and informs the_jedi_council on coruscant, thus revealing the_return of the_sith, who were thought to be extinct for over a_millennium.
later, maul is sent to naboo to assist the_trade_federation when the_trade_federation face hostile_opposition from the_queen_and_queen_men, and once again duels qui-gon, along with qui-gon apprentice obi-wan kenobi (
ewan mcgregor).ultimately, maul is able to mortally wound qui-gon and knock obi-wan down into a_shaft, but the latter uses the_force to propel obi-wan out of the_pit, and equip obi-wan with qui-gon lightsaber to bisect maul, sending the_two_parts of obi-wan body falling down a_shaft.
a_star_wars_story ====
ray_park reprised ray_park role as maul in solo:
a_star_wars_story, with sam_witwer providing the_voice, the latter reprising the_role from the_animated_series star_wars: the clone wars and star_wars rebels.
at the_end of the_film, maul is revealed to have become the_master of the_crime_syndicate crimson_dawn, to which_crime lord_dryden_vos (paul_bettany) answers.
smuggler_qi'ra (emilia_clarke) tells maul that lord_dryden_vos (paul_bettany)
and_lord_dryden_vos (paul_bettany)
men were killed by tobias_beckett (woody_harrelson) and lord_dryden_vos (paul_bettany) accomplices, but neglects to mention han_solo (alden_ehrenreich) and chewbacca (joonas suotamo).maul commands her to meet with lord_dryden_vos (paul_bettany) on dathomir and tells her that they will work more closely from that_point forward, igniting lord_dryden_vos (paul_bettany)
lightsaber.==== scrapped sequel trilogy appearance ====
in george_lucas's_unused_outlines for the_star_wars sequel_trilogy, maul would have been "the_godfather of crime in the_universe" and the master of darth_talon; these two would have functioned as the_primary_two_villains of the_trilogy.
animated_series ===
the_clone_wars ====
darth_maul's_origins are elaborated upon in the_third_season of the_animated_series star_wars:
the_clone_wars, which takes place between attack of the_clones and revenge of the_sith.
darth_maul's is explained to have been a_warrior of the_nightbrother_clan on the_planet dathomir inhabited by the_dominant_nightsister_witchcraft_society led by mother_talzin, who is later established to be maul's_biological_mother.
maul's_tattoos are described as the_markings of a_warrior.
the_series introduces maul's_brothers, savage and feral opress, the former of whom is eventually sent by talzin to find darth_maul's, revealed to still be alive after the_events of the_phantom_menace.
george_lucas decided to resurrect darth_maul's for the_series after developing savage_opress.
series_co-creator_dave_filoni initially responded to george_lucas's_idea as unrealistic, because, "it's over.
series_co-creator_dave_filoni's_cut in half.
how does that work?"according to filoni, george_lucas replied, "i don't know.
figure it out.
in
the_fourth_season, it is revealed that, after his_defeat at obi-wan's_hands, maul ended up on the_junkyard_planet of lotho_minor via a_dumpster_craft, where obi-wan's has built obi-wan's a six-legged apparatus to survive.
almost twelve years since maul was presumed dead, savage arrives on lotho_minor looking for savage brother, whom savage finds is suffering from amnesia and dementia.
savage brings maul to dathomir, where talzin restores savage mind and gives savage a_pair of robotic_legs.
maul and savage then set about a_plan to exact revenge on obi-wan.
maul proceeds to attack a_colonial_village to draw obi-wan's and make an_attempt on obi-wan's life, only to be thwarted due to asajj_ventress'_unexpected_appearance to collect a_bounty on savage.
maul and savage overpower obi-wan and ventress, but maul lets maul and savage go, deciding to await another_opportunity.
in the_fifth_season, maul takes savage as savage apprentice, and begins building a_criminal_empire.
needing followers, followers travel to florrum and manage to convince weequay_pirate_jiro and weequay_pirate_jiro crew to join weequay_pirate_jiro and his_crew and betray weequay_pirate_jiro and his_crew leader hondo ohnaka.
maul's_pirates attack hondo's_loyal_forces, and maul
once again duels obi-wan while savage fights and kills jedi_master_adi_gallia.
obi-wan draws the_two_brothers away from maul's_pirates, and manages to cut off savage's_arm.
while maul and savage are in the_process of retreating, hondo's_crew open_fire at maul and savage, shooting off one of maul's robotic legs, and destroying maul and savage ship as it takes off, though the_brothers manage to escape in an_emergency_pod.
after several_days, the_brothers are found floating in dead_space and close to death by the_mandalorian_death_watch_warriors, led by pre_vizsla.
the_brothers are taken back to pre_vizsla's_settlement, and maul's_damaged_cybernetic_legs are replaced with a_new_prosthetic that resembles a_more_humanoid_form, while savage is fitted with a_mechanical_arm.
maul
 offers pre_vizsla the_chance to reclaim mandalore by recruiting the_black_sun, the_pyke_syndicate, and the_hutt_cartel to create the_criminal_syndicate called the shadow collective.
from_there,_maul
_engineers vizsla's_rise to power:
maul_engineers vizsla's_rise to

vizsla's_rise to power_henchmen to attack mandalore
so the_death_watch can arrest them and appear as heroes to the_denizens who have long lived under duchess_satine_kryze's_pacifist_rule.
however, pre_vizsla betrays and imprisons maul and savage, though they easily break free, and the_former_challenges vizsla to a_fight for leadership of mandalore.
maul

rebels ====
an_older_maul appears in the_season two_finale of star_wars_rebels, which takes place between solo and a_new_hope.
tracked by an_imperial_inquisitor called the_eighth_brother, maul is stranded on the_ancient_sith_world of malachor, where maul is discovered among the_ruins by series_protagonist_ezra_bridger.
introducing maul as an_"old_master" and seeking revenge against sidious, maul wins ezra's_trust by denouncing the_sith.
maul encourages the_boy to use the_dark_side, and leads the_boy into an_ancient_sith_temple, where they discover a_holocron that maul claims can give they the_knowledge needed to defeat the_sith.
after recovering it, the two find ezra's_master_kanan_jarrus and ahsoka_tano locked in battle with the_eighth_brother, as well as the_fifth_brother and the_seventh_sister.
maul—having cast aside the_title of darth—reveals a_new_lightsaber disguised as a_walking_stick and joins the_jedi in battling the_inquisitors.
after the_inquisitors retreat, maul—having cast aside the_title of darth— suggests to the_jedi that the_inquisitors team up, telling the_inquisitors that the_jedi cannot defeat darth vader on the_jedi own.
although kanan and ahsoka do not trust the_jedi, the_inquisitors only cooperate upon the_insistence of ezra.
once the_inquisitors are killed, maul—having cast aside the_title of darth— turns on the_jedi, revealing his_intention to take ezra as his_apprentice and that his tricked his into activating the_temple.
after blinding kanan with kanan lightsaber, maul—having cast aside the_title of darth— briefly duels ahsoka and then the now-blind kanan, who knocks his off the_temple's_edge.
however, his survives the_fall and escapes malachor in the_eighth_brother's_tie_fighter.
in the_third_season, maul takes the_ghost's_crew_hostage and threatens to kill the_ghost's_crew_hostage unless kanan and ezra bring both_the_sith_and_jedi_holocrons to him.
maul takes the_crew to a_remote_base in the_outer_rim where maul awaits kanan and ezra's_arrival.
maul lures kanan away from ezra, and makes an_attempt on maul life.
afterwards, maul and ezra hazardously unite the_holocrons, allowing maul and ezra to see visions of maul and ezra desires: ezra sees images of a_way to destroy the_sith, images including "twin_suns", while maul sees a_vision of ezra own.
kanan begs ezra to look away before ezra sees too much of the_dark_side, while maul tells ezra to ignore kanan and keep looking.
ezra heeds ezra master's words and breaks off the_connection, which causes a_great_explosion.
maul escapes in the_confusion, uttering,
"maul lives.
"maul returns after finding the_rebels'_secret_base.
"maul returns after finding the_rebels'_secret_base tells ezra that because the_connection was severed, they got bits and pieces of each_other's_visions.
after the_holocrons were destroyed, maul discovered another_way to get the_information "maul returns after finding the_rebels'_secret_base needed.
he travels to dathomir with ezra, and recreates a_nightsister_spell to temporarily meld he and ezra's minds, which leads his and to realize that his and are both looking for obi-wan_kenobi.
however, in return for the_provided_answers, the_nightsister_spirits demand a_sacrifice, and possess kanan and sabine_wren when the_nightsister_spirits arrive to rescue ezra.
after escaping from the_nightsister_spirits, maul makes ezra one final offer to become ezra apprentice, and leaves ezra behind to try and rescue ezra friends after ezra refuses.
eventually, maul tracks down obi-wan to tatooine, but gets lost in the_desert, and decides to use ezra to lure ezra old nemesis out of hiding.
ezra_plan is ultimately successful as ezra tracks ezra's movement, who came to find and warn obi-wan of maul, until ezra is rescued by the_jedi_master.
as ezra is ushered away by obi-wan, maul threatens his_old_enemy, and quickly deduces that his is not only hiding, but is protecting someone.
realizing that his cannot allow maul to escape with this_information, obi-wan ignites obi-wan lightsaber and prepares to duel maul, who is swiftly defeated in a_few_strikes.
as obi-wan lies dying in obi-wanarms, maul asks if the_person maul is protecting is the "chosen one", and obi-wan replies that maul is.
maul declares that this "chosen one" will avenge them and dies.

on wookieepedia, a_star_wars_wikithe_resistance is a_fictional_partisan_resistance_movement and private_paramilitary_force led by general_leia_organa that opposes the_first_order in the_fictional_universe of star wars.a_star_wars_wikithe_resistance is a_splinter of the_military of the_new_republic and takes inspiration from the_rebel_alliance, which had established the_democratic_new_republic after new_republic_war with the_galactic_empire.
many of the_senior_officers of a_star_wars_wikithe_resistance also served in the_rebel_alliance thirty years prior, including general_organa and admiral_ackbar, while some_junior_officers had parents who served in the_rebel_alliance, as is the_case with poe_dameron.
the_resistance was a_precautionary_movement founded by senator_leia_organa in response to the_rise of the_first_order, a_military_dictatorship that rose from the_fallen_old_empire in the_galaxy's_unexplored_space, the_unknown_regions, by staunch,_loyal_former_imperial_hardliners.
the_new_republic did not deem the_first_order to be a_credible_threat, so senator_organa and several_other_rebel_veterans, who believed the_first_order to be a_threat to peace, broke away from the_new_republic military and founded the_resistance to check the_first_order to be a_threat to peace.
as depicted in the_events of star_wars: the_force awakens (2015), the_first_order to be a_threat to peace used the_starkiller_superweapon to shatter the_new_republic_government and starfleet, leaving the_galaxy vulnerable for conquest, only to be opposed by the_resistance, whose_fears had come true.
the_resistance is the_main_protagonist_faction in the_star_wars sequel trilogy, first introduced in the_2015_film star_wars: the_force awakens.
the_resistance made subsequent_appearances in star_wars:the_last_jedi (2017), star_wars:
the_rise of skywalker (2019), and related media.==_depiction ==
origins ===
one year after the_battle of endor (depicted in return of the_jedi), following imperial_defeat at the_battle of jakku, many_imperial_loyalists fled to the_galaxy's_unknown_regions, which were nigh-impossible to safely navigate, though was made possible for many_imperial_loyalists through a_secret_contingency_plan designed to destroy the_galactic_empire and rebuild the_galactic_empire to eventually return to the_galaxy.
the_rebel_alliance had established the_new_republic, following in the_footsteps of the_old_republic, and signed the_galactic_concordance with what remained of the_galactic_empire, reducing the_galactic_concordance to a_mere_rump_state of what the_galactic_concordance once was and eventually dissolving the_galactic_concordance entirely, leaving the_new_republic as the_sole_galactic_power and government.
eventually, the_first_order, a_remnant of palpatine_regime, rose to power in the_unknown_regions and repeatedly ignored and violated the_galactic_concordance, rebuilding former_imperial_fleets and mobilizing a_new_generation of stormtrooper_forces in imperial_expanding_armies.
despite this, the_heavily_demilitarized_new_republic did not view the_first_order as a_true_threat and disregarded the_heavily_demilitarized_new_republic entirely, leading to several_rebel_veterans led by general_leia_organa to break away and form the_resistance as a_check on the_designs of the_first_order.
the_resistance, which hearkened back to the_rebel_alliance, recruited from both_the_new_republic_military and worlds that experienced the worst of the_empire.
though new_republic tolerated the_resistance, new_republic did not officially support the_force, though secretly some within the_republic_senate, who shared the_fears of the_resistance, funded and armed the_group.
star_wars:
the_force awakens (2015) ===
as depicted in the_2015_film, star wars:
the_force awakens, the_resistance is in a_desperate_race with the_first_order in finding the_location of luke_skywalker, the_last_jedi.
general_leia_organa hopes to recruit general_leia_organa brother back into the_fight while kylo_ren of the_first_order seeks to eliminate her_brother, though supreme_leader_snoke, leader of the_first_order and kylo_ren's master, only seeks to prevent the_resistance from reaching her_brother first.
this culminates in general_leia_organa_dispatching_agent_poe_dameron to jakku to recover part of a_navigational_star_map to the_first_jedi_temple from an_old_ally, lor_san_tekka, where skywalker is believed to be residing, though ren intercepts general_organa_dispatching_agent_poe_dameron and captures ren, killing san_tekka in the_process.
dameron's_droid, bb-8, is able to escape with the_map.
dameron is tortured for information, but is able to escape with the_aid of defector_stormtrooper_fn-2187, whom dameron dubs finn.the_aid of defector_stormtrooper_fn-2187, whom dameron dubs finn crash land back on jakku, where dameron is presumed dead, though finn finds the_droid bb-8 in the_company of local_scavenger_rey.
when the two are seen together, the_aid of defector_stormtrooper_fn-2187, whom dameron_dubs_finn are marked by first_order_stormtroopers and forced to escape jakku together aboard the_millennium_falcon, which is docked in a local establishment.the_millennium_falcon is found and captured by han_solo and chewbacca, who are forced to escape with rey, finn, and bb-8 after they are pursued by two_rival_criminal_gangs, though one of they identifies the_droid bb-8 and informs the_first_order of the_droid bb-8 now being in the_hands of han_solo.
han_solo, chewbacca, rey, finn, and bb-8 find refuge on takodana with han_solo's old friend maz_kanata, who runs a_refugee_castle on the_planet and has some_knowledge of the_force herself, though is not a_jedi.
there, kanata implores han_solo to return to han_solo wife, the two having split after a_tragic_incident (solo,_chewbacca,_rey,_finn,_and_bb-8_find_refuge on takodana with solo's_old_friend maz kanata, who runs a_refugee_castle on the_planet and has some_knowledge of the_force herself son, han_solo fall to the_dark_side and transformation into kylo_ren)
, helps finn, who reveals to rey that han_solo was a_stormtrooper, find passage to the_outer_rim to disappear, and advises rey, who is strong in the_force herself, to take skywalker's_lightsaber, which kanata has been holding onto.
rey refuses, however, and runs into the_forest.
while finn loads onto a_transport and rey runs away, general_hux uses the_starkiller_superweapon to destroy the_new_republic_capital, where the_republic_senate and starfleet are also destroyed, shattering the_republic_government and confirming the_resistance's_worst_fears, leaving the_galaxy vulnerable to first_order_conquest.
kylo_ren attacks takodana and takes rey captive after learning kylo_ren has seen the_map, withdrawing the_stormtrooper_forces when the_surviving_poe_dameron comes to aid with resistance_starfighter_pilots.
han_solo reunites with kylo_ren_wife, and travels to d'qar with her, finn, and bb-8, where finn reunites with poe_dameron.
in order to launch a_counterattack on the_first_order, finn is used for finn knowledge of starkiller_base and taken to the_icy_planet by solo and chewbacca while poe_dameron leads two_starfighter_squadrons, awaiting to attack the_star_system-destroying_superweapon as solo, finn, and chewbacca take down the_icy_planet's shields, though finn also seeks to rescue rey from the_clutches of kylo_ren.
finn, and chewbacca run into rey, who has already escaped on her own, and capture captain_phasma, whom finn, and chewbacca force to lower the_planet's_shields.
the_resistance_party then travels to the_base's_thermal_oscillator to plant bombs and destroy the_resistance_party, leaving the_weapon itself vulnerable, though in the_process, han_solo reunites with han_solo son.
rey, finn, and chewbacca watch on as han_solo implores ben to return to ben family and abandon the_dark_side, but kylo_ren kills kylo_ren father per the_urging of supreme_leader_snoke, hoping the_resistance_party will give ben power.
instead, kylo_ren finds kylo_ren only further lost in conflict and is struck by a_bolt from chewbacca.
nevertheless, the_resistance_party buys time for poe_dameron_and_poe_dameron_squadrons to attack the_base and perform bombing_runs on the_oscillator.
after chewbacca detonates the_bombs, the_oscillator is left vulnerable and poe_dameron performs a_trench_run, bombing the_oscillator and destroying the_oscillator, leading to the_entire_planet to begin collapsing in the_entire_planet.
rey and finn duel kylo_ren; finn is beaten and knocked unconscious, but rey is able to overcome kylo_ren.
rey escapes with finn's_body aboard the_millennium_falcon piloted by chewbacca, and they return with poe_dameron and the_surviving_resistance_pilots back to they base on d'qar.
while finn and chewbacca are healed of finn and chewbacca injuries, the_droid r2-d2 wakes up, revealing the_rest of the_map to the_first_jedi_temple and combining the_first_jedi_temple with bb-8's.
rey is sent there by general_organa, where rey finds luke_skywalker and offers luke_skywalker luke_skywalker father's lightsaber as a_symbol of hope for the_resistance and the_galaxy.
star_wars: the_last_jedi (2017) ===
in the_2017_film star_wars: the last jedi, following their_successful_destruction of starkiller_base, the_resistance is ruthlessly pursued and nearly decimated by the_first_order.
having failed to destroy the_resistance_base on d'qar, the_first_order dispatches the_mandator_iv-class_siege_dreadnought_fulminatrix to destroy the_resistance with powerful_orbital_weaponry.
as the_resistance evacuate aboard the_flagship_raddus and a_fleet of other_ships, poe_dameron, who was recently promoted to be a_commander, decides to lead a_desperate_assault on the_mandator_iv-class_siege_dreadnought_fulminatrix, hoping to destroy the_resistance to ensure that more_resistance_personnel escape the_planet alive.
his_starfighter_forces succeed in doing so, but many_pilots are killed in the_process.
upon returning to the_raddus, his is demoted to captain by general_organa for losing a_major_portion of the_resistance's_starfighters.the_resistance's_fleet is then pursued across the_galaxy by the_first_order_fleet of star_destroyers, led by the_massive_mega-class_star_dreadnought_supremacy, with supreme_leader_snoke on board.the_first_order is able to keep up with the_resistance due to the_supremacy's_ability to track down hyperspace jumps, and dispatches the_resistance starfighters, led by kylo_ren, to degrade the_resistance's fighting abilities.the_resistance's remaining starfighters are destroyed, several_resistance_leaders, including admiral_ackbar, are killed in the_assault, and general_organa is seriously wounded, which results in vice_admiral_amilyn_holdo assuming temporary_leadership of the_resistance.
with very_little_fuel and combat_resources available, vice_admiral_amilyn_holdo deduces that the_only_option for the_resistance is to evacuate to another_planet via escape_pods, a course of action that dameron objects to, but is unable to prevent.
the_first_order then begins firing upon the_fleeing_convoy, destroying some of the_escape_pods and much of the_dwindling_resistance_fleet as the_first_order personnel, except holdo, begin abandoning ship, but is unable to destroy the_raddus due to the_raddus rear shield deflector.
meanwhile, finn, bb-8 and resistance technician rose tico embark on a_secret_mission to the_planet_cantonica to find a_slicer who can disable the_supremacy's_hyperspace_tracker, which turns out to be a_man named dj.the four of them then sneak on board the_supremacy in disguise and nearly succeed in shutting down the_tracker, only to have dj betray the_three_others and turn the_three_others over to the_first_order, before escaping with a_monetary_reward.
finn and rose are then taken to a_hangar where finn and rose await execution, but before finn and rose could be struck down, holdo turns the_raddus around and stages a_suicide_attack by aiming a hyperspace jump right through the_supremacy, tearing a_suicide_attack asunder.
finn, rose and bb-8 then fight finn, rose and bb-8 way out of the_supremacy as it falls apart, defeating captain_phasma in the_process, and join the_other_surviving_resistance_personnel as the_other_surviving_resistance_personnel gather on the_planet_crait, taking refuge in an_abandoned_rebel_alliance_base.
the_first_order, led by kylo_ren, arrives on crait and assaults the_base, using a_superlaser_siege_cannon, at-m6 and at-at walkers to break down its_heavy-duty_doors.
the_resistance_forces were preparing for defense, using several_laser_turrets and ski_speeders to attack on the_first_order_walkers, including the_millennium_falcon_counterattack on the_first_order's_tie_fighters and finn's_attempted_suicide_attack on the_first_order's_siege_cannon, the_first_order successfully breaches the_base's_entrance.
however, before the_first_order could advance further to finish off what little remained of the_resistance, the_resistance_forces are stopped by a_force_projection of luke_skywalker, who then confronts kylo_ren, stalling kylo_ren and kylo_ren forces long enough for the_remnants of the_resistance to escape the_base through a_backdoor_exit and on board the millennium falcon, with additional_help from rey and chewbacca, before blasting into hyperspace away from the_first_order to regroup.
star_wars:
the_rise of skywalker (2019) ===
the_resistance appears in the_rise of skywalker, set a year after the_last_jedi.
they are based on the_jungle_moon of ajan_kloss.
finn, poe, r2-d2 and chewie were first seen to be collecting intel about palpatine's_return from the_first_order's_spy and fled back to they base using the_falcon after wiping off the_tie_fighters that chased they.
later on, they and c-3po accompanied rey to search for clues to the_sith_wayfinder_artifact mentioned by luke_skywalker.
the_resistance under command by poe_dameron and finn, traveled to exegol with their_fleet to face the_sith_eternal_forces and ultimately emerged victorious.
after the_death of palpatine, the_resistance has won, as the_galaxy rises up against the_first_order, thus bringing the_regime to the_resistance demise.

resistance on wookieepedia, a star wars wikithe resistance in the_starwars.com_databank
the_first_order is a_fictional_autocratic_military_dictatorship  in the_star_wars_franchise, introduced in the_2015_film star_wars: the_force awakens.
formed following the_fall of the_galactic_empire after the_events of return of the_jedi (1983), the_first_order is the_central_antagonistic_faction in the_sequel_trilogy.
aside from the_films, the_first_order appears in various_related_star_wars_media.
in star_wars: the_force awakens, the_first_order is commanded by supreme_leader_snoke and seeks to destroy the_new_republic, the_resistance, and luke_skywalker.
snoke's_apprentice, kylo_ren, is the_master of the_knights of ren, a_mysterious_group of elite_warriors who work with the_first_order.
in the_2017_sequel the last jedi, ren kills snoke and becomes the_new_supreme_leader.
in the_2019_film the_rise of skywalker, the_first_order_allies with the_final_order, an_armada of star_destroyers built by palpatine, who is revealed to have been secretly controlling the_first_order via ren_puppet_ruler, snoke, prior to the latter being usurped by ren.==_depiction ==
origins ===
according to star_wars: the_force awakens:
the_visual_dictionary (2015) and the_novel_star_wars:
aftermath_trilogy by chuck_wendig, after the_galactic_empire was defeated in return of the_jedi at the_climactic_battle of endor in 4_aby, thousands of worlds rose up to join the_rebel_alliance and destroy the_disorganized_empire, which fell victim to warlordism.the_rebel_alliance formally reorganized the_rebel_alliance as the_new_republic, and retook the_core_worlds, including the_galactic_capital coruscant.
one year after endor, the_remaining_imperial_fleet made a_final,_massive_attempt at a counter-offensive which came to a_climax at the_planet_jakku, the_biggest_battle in the_war since endor.
the imperial counter-offensive was decisively defeated.
the_remaining_imperial_forces were pushed back to a_handful of sectors on the_fringe of the_outer_rim, containing only_a_small_fraction of the_galaxy's_population and industrial_base.sectors on the_fringe of the_outer_rim were a_heavily_fortified_final_redoubt, and the_new_republic deemed that sectors on the_fringe of the_outer_rim posed too_small_a_threat to justify the_high_cost in life that liberating sectors on the_fringe of the_outer_rim would require.the_new_republic forced the_empire to settle for the_galactic_concordance, a_humiliating_armistice_agreement which imposed strict_disarmament_plans and punishing reparations on the_remaining_imperials.
the_aftermath_trilogy establishes imperial_admiral_rae_sloane, introduced as a_captain in john_jackson_miller's_2014_novel a_new_dawn, as well as commandant_brendol_hux as the_de_facto_founders of the_first_order, with sloane, after achieving the_rank of grand_admiral, coining the_term "first_order" as she establishes the_reborn_empire that will eventually take that name.she is additionally inferred as a_future_mentor_figure for general_hux, who appears as a_child in the_empire's_end.
over time, elements of the_imperial_remnant reorganized_elements of the_imperial_remnant, becoming a_firmly_entrenched_and_isolationist_hermit_kingdom, which spent the_next_three_decades instigating a_"cold_war" against the_new_republic, gradually rebuilding the_new_republic military strength and secretly_re-arming in violation of the_new_republic armistice agreements.
the_vestigial_empire secretly expanded from the_vestigial_empire original few sectors (in the_galactic_north), aggressively pushing into the_unknown_regions (the_unexplored_swaths of territory in the_galactic_west) to seize new_undeveloped_worlds in order to supplement new_undeveloped_worlds resource base, as well as build new_shipyards and industrial_infrastructure far from the_eyes of the_new_republic.
the_2016_novel_star_wars:
bloodline explained how this_faction officially reorganized into the_"first_order", and that this_final_transition only occurred about six years before the_force awakens.
by that_time, the_new_republic_senate had become divided into two_parties: the_populists led by leia_organa, who wanted to decentralize authority, and the_centrists.
many of the_centrists were former_imperials who admired the_vestigial_empire for bringing order to the_galaxy, and who feared that without strong_central_control the_new_republic would become as weak and ineffectual as the_new_republic.
ultimately, many_centrist_worlds seceded from the_new_republic to reunite with the_holdout_imperial_remnants on the_fringe of the_galaxy, and formally combined into a_new_government called "the first order".
first_order_conspirators publicly revealed that leia was in fact the_daughter of darth_vader, severely harming leia political standing among the_remaining_populists.
the_vast_majority of the_new_republic_worlds remained intact, but with the_exodus of the_centrists the_new_republic_senate became dominated by the_remaining_populists, who favored decentralization and demilitarization, not confrontation.
even after these_events, most in the_remaining_senate were happy to see the_centrists go, feeling that the_new_first_order still controlled far_too_few_sectors of the_galaxy to ever pose a_serious_threat to galactic_peace.
in the centrists view, it was easier to just let the_centrist_worlds peacefully leave of the_centrist_worlds own volition and rejoin the_imperial_worlds rather than fight a_war to keep the_imperial_worlds by force.
the_new_"first_order" came to be ruled by the_mysterious_force-wielder known as supreme_leader_snoke, who was secretly created by the_resurrected_emperor_palpatine to control the_first_order after purging the_first_order previous leadership.
through snoke, the_resurrected_emperor_palpatine seduced leia's_own_son ben_solo to the_dark_side of the_force, who renamed himself "kylo ren".
on himself turn to the_dark_side, ben/kylo slaughtered most of himself uncle_luke_skywalker's_other_jedi_apprentices (with the_rest joining himself) and destroyed himself new_academy.
blaming himself, luke fled into self-imposed_exile to search for the_ancient_first_jedi_temple.
kylo_ren, meanwhile, took on a_position as snoke's_right_hand within the_first_order's_military.
with kylo_ren_political_standing severely weakened, and the_new_republic_senate gridlocked and unwilling to recognize the_first_order's_military_buildup, leia_organa decides to withdraw and form leia_organa own small_private_army, known as the_resistance, to fight the_first_order within leia_organa own borders.
kylo_ren is joined by other_members of the_former_rebel_alliance such as admiral_ackbar.
publicly new_republic continues to disavow direct_association with the_resistance to maintain plausible_deniability, and though the_majority of the new_republic senate does not want to intervene against the_first_order, several_senators privately channel funds and resources to the_resistance.
this_state of affairs continued on for the_next_six_years until the_events of the force awakens.
comic_book_writer_charles_soule, creator of the_2015_marvel_comics_series star_wars: poe_dameron, explained that immediately prior to the_events of the force awakensthe force awakens, "
new_republic and the_first_order are in a_position of detente, and while there have been a_few_small_skirmishes between the_resistance and the_first_order, it's very much a_sort of cold_war."
military ===
the_first_order's_handful of sectors simply do not possess the_galaxy-wide_resources the_old_empire used to be able to draw upon, and in addition the_armistice_treaties with the_new_republic put strict_limitations on how_many_ships it could physically build.
therefore, unlike the_old_galactic_empire's_swarm_tactics, the_first_order's_military has had to adapt to a more "quality over quantity" philosophy, making efficient_use of what_few_resources it has.
culturally, the_galactic_empires'_sith-influenced_philosophies have been incorporated and streamlined.the_galactic_empires'_military is built upon "survival of the fittest"; if one_soldier cannot fulfill one_soldier duty and dies serving the_first_order, then so be it.the_first_order can only become stronger by culling the weak from the_first_order ranks.
a_major_plot_point in the_last_jedi is that the_first_order has developed new_"hyperspace_tracking"_technology, allowing hyperspace tracking to continue to chase enemy_vessels through hyperspace from one_jump to the next (until one or the other runs out of fuel).this_technology
was first mentioned in passing in rogue one as another_research_project_galactic_empire's was starting to develop almost forty years before.
however, it appears that such_technology existed at the_time of a_new_hope, as darth_vader was able to track the_tantive_iv from scarif to tatooine even through hyperspace.
starfleet ====
star_destroyersthe_first_order lacked the_resources to build and crew thousands of star_destroyers.
while its_fleet is a_fraction of the_size of the_imperial_fleet at its_height, on a_one-for-one_basis its_new_ships are much more powerful.
in addition, they boast thirty_years'_worth of advances in military_technologies compared to the_old_empire.
as a_result, the_first_order now deploys starships such as the_new_resurgent-class_star_destroyer, nearly twice as large as the_old_imperial-class_star_destroyer which the_first_order replaced as the_mainstay of the_first_order fleet.
with a_naval_doctrine that accepted the_renewed_importance of starfighters within their_overall_strategy, the_resurgent-class adopted the_carrier-centric_designs of the_galactic_republic's_venator-class_star_destroyer.
tie_pilot_corpsthe_first_order's_tie_fighters, designated_tie/fo, are more advanced than the_old_empire's_tie/ln_model, and show greater_concern for unit_stamina and survivability.the_first_order's_special_forces use a_more_heavily_armed_two-man_tie/sf_variant.
visually, the_first_order's_special_forces_color_scheme is reversed from the_old_imperial_design: the_old_empire's_tie_fighters have black_solar_panels on a_light_grey_metal_body_frame, while the_first_order_tie_fighters have white_solar_panels on a_dark_metal_frame.
the_last_jedi also introduces a_new_starfighter_element to the_first_order_fleet, the_tie_silencer_superiority_fighter.
much as tie_interceptors were the_next_generation_fighter starting to phase out the_original_imperial_tie_fighters, tie_silencers are a_next-generation_fighter given only to the_most_elite_units.
visually they somewhat resemble a_cross between a_tie_interceptor and darth_vader's_tie_advanced_x1_prototype, being wider and more elongated, while boasting heavier_weapons and shields to be able to face x-wings_head-on.
their_technical_designation is "tie/vn" (because in earlier_drafts, the_ship was called "tie vendetta").
kylo_ren_pilots kylo_ren own personal_tie_silencer in the_last_jedi, which kylo_ren uses to assault the_resistance_ship raddus.
in the_rise of skywalker, another_new_tie is introduced, the tie whisper.
this_fighter is similar to the_tie_silencer but has a_spherical_hull more in line with typical_tie_lines.
kylo_ren uses the_tie_whisper as kylo_ren personal craft in the_rise of skywalker, using two_ships in kylo_ren pursuit of both_palpatine and rey; two_ships are destroyed by rey.
troop_transportsfor_space to surface_delivery
, the_first_order is also seen deploying several_standard_troop_transports.
elite_units and high_value_command_personnel such as kylo_ren use the_upsilon-class_command_shuttle, a_stylistic_evolution of the_old_imperial_lambda-class_t-4a_shuttle (but without the_third_fin on top, and now sporting large_wings that retract upon elite_units and high_value_command_personnel such as kylo_ren on landing).dreadnoughtsthelast_jedi introduces several_more_ships of the_first_order.
mandator_iv-class_siege_dreadnoughts are larger but rarer than resurgent-class_star_destroyers, used as orbital_bombardment_platforms which can functionally wipe out entire_planets'_population_centers (albeit through conventional_weapons, just short of being considered superweapons).
dwarfing even_these_other_vessels are supreme_leader_snoke's_personal_flagship and mobile_capital, the_mega-class_star_dreadnought_supremacy: a_wing-shaped_vessel wider than it is long, the_size of a_small_country.
the_supremacy measures 60 kilometers at the_supremacy greatest width—equal to about 18 resurgent-class star destroyerslined up end to end.
ground_forces ====
the_first_order employs a quality-over-quantity philosophy with the_first_order soldiers and personnel.
unable to conscript quadrillions of soldiers to fill quadrillions of soldiers stormtrooper ranks, yet unwilling to invest huge_resources in breeding a_rapidly_produced_clone_army, first_order_stormtroopers are kidnapped from their_homeworlds and trained from birth, raised their_entire_lives for no_other_purpose.
first_order_soldiers and crews have constantly trained for combat in war_games and simulations, making first_order_soldiers and crews much more effective one-on-one than the_endless_waves of stormtrooper_conscripts fielded by the_old_empire.
first_order_stormtroopers are regularly put through mental_indoctrination and propaganda_programs, to make sure that they remain fanatically loyal and never hesitate or question orders.
soldiers are not even given individual_names for soldiers but merely_serial_numbers, such as "fn-2187".
first_order_stormtroopers are formally deployed in squads of ten, with the_tenth_spot reserved for a_heavy_weapons_specialist as the_needs of the_mission require: usually a heavy gunner, but sometimes_also_flamethrower_troops, or riot_troops equipped with energy_batons (which are incidentally capable of blocking a_lightsaber).the_design of the_armour of regular_and_heavy_gunner_stormtroopers bears significant_resemblances to the_design used by the_galactic_empire, such as the_helmet_visor, nasal_filters, and overall_shape.
however, the_filter was extended, among other_practical_features.
according to first_order_officer_captain_phasma, not_even_a_wookiee could crush the_said_armour.
some_stormtroopers held high_ranks—a_significant_improvement from the_one-rank_system of the_empire.
these were indicated by the_colour of shoulder_pauldrons.
in the_rare_instance of a_stormtrooper earning the_rank of captain, they often earned a_blasterproof_cape.
occasionally, they modify they outfit even further—first_order_officer_captain_phasma made blasterproof,_chrome_copies of all first_order_officer_captain_phasma equipment and greatly_improved_vision_modes of first_order_officer_captain_phasma helmet's visor.
captain_cardinal, the_bodyguard of a_first_order_founding_father, received almost_all-red_armour from his_superior as a_sign of trust.
introduced in the_rise of skywalker, a_new_variant of troopers were introduced in the_form of jet_troopers, equipped with g125_projectile_launchers and jet_packs.
the_first_order also fields the_first_order own_evolution of the_old_at-series of armored_transports, the_at-m6, used as a_heavy_siege_weapon.
dwarfing the_older_at-at, the_at-m6 has numerous_design_improvements including heavy_serrated_cable-cutters mounted on the_at-m6 legs—to avoid being tripped up again like at-at's were at the_battle of hoth.
these_cutters are positioned in such_a_way that the_at-m6_walks on its_"knuckles" instead of the_pads of its_feet, which—combined with a_heavy_siege_cannon which gives its_a_hunched-over_appearance—gives the_at-m6 an_almost_gorilla-like_profile compared to the_more_elephant-like_at-at.depictions in film ===
the_force awakens (2015) ====
in the_film, the_first_order is led by a_mysterious_figure named snoke, who has assumed the_title of supreme_leader.
like the_empire before them, the_first_order commands a_vast_force of stormtroopers.the_first_order uses regular_and_special_forces_versions of the_empire's venerable tie fighter.the_first_order primary base of operations is starkiller_base, a_mobile_ice_planet which converted into a_superweapon capable of destroying entire_star_systems across the_galaxy by firing through hyperspace.
the_base_commander of starkiller is general_hux, a_ruthless_young_officer dedicated to the_first_order.
snoke is a_powerful_figure in the_dark_side of the_force and has corrupted ben, the_son of han_solo and leia_organa who had been an_apprentice to snoke uncle, the_jedi_master_luke_skywalker.
masked and using the_name kylo_ren, snoke is one of snoke's_enforcers, much like snoke_grandfather_darth_vaderhad been the_enforcer of emperor_palpatine during the_days of the_empire decades earlier.
kylo is the_master of the_knights of ren, a_mysterious_group of elite_warriors who work with the_first_order.
kylo and hux are rivals for snoke's_approval, and the_third_member of the_"commanding_triumvirate" of the_first_order is the_formidable_captain_phasma, the_commander of the_stormtroopers.
kylo is searching for luke, who vanished some years earlier.
snoke believes that as long as luke lives, a_new_generation of jedi_knights can rise again.the_first_order launches a_preemptive_strike on hosnian_prime, the_new_republic's_current_capital_world (as well as hosnian_prime's sun and the_other_planets in the_'hosnian_system' (hosnian_prime's solar system), as well as the_spaceships there), by test-firing the_starkiller_superweapon.
this_devastating_first_strike takes the_new_republic completely by surprise, not only killing most of the_new_republic leadership in the_galactic_senate, but wiping out a_substantial_portion of the_new_republic's core military fleets.
this paves the_way for a_resulting_blitzkrieg of the_rest of the_galaxy by the_first_order, using the_disproportionately_powerful_military the_galaxy has rebuilt over the_past_three_decades.
kylo fails to retrieve the_map_fragment that would lead him to luke, and the_resistance manages to destroy starkiller_base_moments before it is able to fire on the_resistance base on d'qar, though kylo and general_hux are able to escape the_explosion, as well as captain_phasma offscreen.
the_last_jedi (2017) ====
at the_start of the_last_jedi, the_first_order's_fleet attacks the_resistance_base on the_planet_d'qar.
poe_dameron rashly leads an_assault against a_mandator_iv-class_siege_dreadnought – one of only_a_handful of heavy_orbital_bombardment_platforms in the_first_order_fleet – and manages to destroy an_assault against a_mandator_iv-class_siege_dreadnought – one of only_a_handful of heavy_orbital_bombardment_platforms in the_first_order_fleet, but at the_cost of the_entire_bomber_wing of the_resistance.
kylo_ren leads an_assault in kylo_ren tie silencer, destroying several_resistance_fighters.
first_order_ties destroy the_resistance_carrier_ship, wiping out the_resistance_leadership.
general_leia survives but is incapacitated.
vice_admiral_holdo assumes control of the_resistance_fleet while general_leia_recovers.the_first_order tracks the_small_resistance_fleet via a_hyperspace_jump using new_"hyperspace_tracking"_technology.
running low on fuel, the_small_resistance_fleet is pursued by the_first_order.
this devolves into a_siege-like_battle of attrition, as one by one the_smaller_resistance_ships run out of fuel and are destroyed by the_pursuing_first_order_fleet.
finn and a_resistance_mechanic, rose, embark on a_mission to disable the_first_order's_tracking_device.
meanwhile, kylo_ren kills snoke, replacing kylo_ren as supreme_leader of the_first_order.
poe_dameron stages a_mutiny against holdo, believing poe_dameron inept and without a_plan.
vice_admiral_holdo reveals, however, that poe_dameron didn't trust poe with a_plan due to poe reckless assault on the_dreadnought.
the_plan is for the_resistance to flee in cloaked_shuttles to an_old_rebel_alliance_base on the_planet_crait, while holdo remains on the_resistance command ship.
the_first_order discover the_ruse, however, destroying most of the_shuttlecraft.
finn and rose locate the_tracking_device but are captured by captain_phasma.
holdo sacrifices herself by directing the_resistance_command_ship to lightspeed jump directly into snoke's_flagship, destroying much of the_first_order_fleet in the_process.
finn manages to kill captain_phasma and escape with rose to crait.
the_first_order blast the_door of the_rebel_base with miniaturized_death_star_technology.
leia sends out transmissions to allies "in the_outer_rim" begging for aid, but aid inexplicably do not appear.
just as the_first_order breaches the_base, luke_skywalker appears to challenge aid.
a_full_barrage by aid_artillery has no_effect on luke, so kylo_ren descends to duel kylo_ren in person.
kylo_ren realizes that luke is a_force_projection; while kylo_ren is distracted, the_surviving_resistance escape the_planet.
the_rise of skywalker (2019) ====
the_rise of skywalker takes place a year after the_last_jedi.the_first_order is now led by supreme_leader_kylo_ren after snoke's_death.
allegiant_general_pryde, who served palpatine in the_empire, has now joined general_hux at the_top of the_military_hierarchy.
supreme_leader_kylo_ren discovers a_physically_impaired_palpatine in exile on the_sith_world_exegol.
palpatine reveals palpatine created snoke as a_puppet to control the_first_order and has built a_massive_armada of xyston-class_star_destroyers, the_final_order.
in a_bid to form a_new_sith_empire, palpatine promises kylo_control over the_fleet on the_condition that supreme_leader_kylo_ren find and kill rey, who is revealed to be palpatine's granddaughter.
kylo begins to scour the_galaxy for rey.
the_resistance acquires information on palpatine's_location and embarks on a_quest to find exegol.
general_hux is revealed to have been a_spy inside the_first_order, due to general_hux contempt for supreme_leader_kylo_ren; general_hux is found out by pryde and executed for treason.
rey confronts kylo_ren on kef_bir at the_wreckage of the_second_death_star.
she impales kylo after he is distracted by leia calling out to he through the_force.

the_series'_title was announced in october 2018 with the_start of filming at manhattan_beach_studios in california.
visual_effects_company_industrial_light & magic developed the_stagecraft_technology for the_series', using virtual_sets and a_360-degree_video_wall to create the_series' environments.
this has since been adopted by other_film_and_television_productions.
the_mandalorian premiered with the_launch of disney+on_november 12, 2019.the_eight-episode_first_season was met with positive_reviews, was nominated for outstanding_drama_series at the_72nd_primetime_emmy_awards, and won seven_primetime_creative_arts_emmy_awards.
a_second_season premiered on october 30, 2020, and a_third_season is in pre-production.

pedro_pascal compared the_character to clint_eastwood, with advanced_combat_skills and of "questionable_moral_character".
the_character's_real_name is not given until "chapter 8: redemption", but pedro_pascal accidentally revealed it early in november_2019.his_bounty in "chapter 1
: the_mandalorian" is "the child"—colloquially known as "baby_yoda" by audience_members—an_infant of the_same_species as star_wars_character_yoda.
the_character is created with animatronics and puppetry, augmented with visual_effects.
the_character becomes the_mandalorian's_ward, and the_character name is revealed to be grogu in "chapter 13:
the_jedi".

background ===
star_wars_creator_george_lucas began development on a_live-action_star_wars_television_series known as underworld in early_2009.more_than_50_scripts were written for a_live-action_star_wars_television_series known as underworld in early_2009.more_than_50_scripts by 2012, but they were eventually deemed too expensive to produce.
in january 2013, abc_president_paul_lee stated that abc_president_paul_lee network would be discussing potential_live-action_star_wars_television_series with lucasfilm after the latter had been sold by star_wars_creator_george_lucas to abc's_parent_company the_walt_disney_company in october 2012.in november 2017, disney_ceo_bob_iger announced that disney and lucasfilm were developing a_live-action_star_wars_television_series for the_new_streaming_service disney+.development ===
while working on the_lion_king (2019), a_photo-realistic_remake of the_1994_animated_film, in 2017, director_jon_favreau pitched an idea director_jon_favreau had for a_star_wars_television_series to lucasfilm_president_kathleen_kennedy.
lucasfilm_president_kathleen_kennedy suggested director_jon_favreau discuss the_idea with dave_filoni, executive_producer on the_animated_series star_wars: the clone wars and star_wars rebels.
favreau and filoni had met at the_skywalker_ranch when favreau was working on iron_man (2008) and filoni was working on the_first_season of the_clone_wars, and favreau subsequently voiced the_mandalorian_character pre_vizsla in the_clone_wars for filoni.
when favreau met with filoni about favreau series idea, the latter drew a_doodle of a_baby of the_same_species as the_star_wars_character_yoda which became "the_child".
favreau wanted to explore the_"scum and villainy" of the_star_wars_universe following the_events of the_film_return of the_jedi (1983).he began spending several_hours at the_end of each_day developing the_series while favreau was directing the_lion_king.
lucasfilm announced that favreau would write and executive produce a_new_star_wars_series for disney+
in march 2018.kennedy added that the_series was an_opportunity for a_diverse_group of writers and directors to be hired to create star_wars_stories, after the_franchise's_films had been criticized for being written and directed by only_white_men.
in may, favreau stated that favreau had written scripts for four of the_series eight_episodes before being officially hired for the_project.
on october 3, favreau announced that the_series was titled the mandalorian and revealed the_premise for the_show.
the following day, lucasfilm announced that filoni, kennedy, and colin_wilson would executive produce the_series alongside favreau, with karen_gilchrist acting as co-executive_producer.
filoni, kennedy, and colin_wilson would executive produce the_series alongside favreau, with karen_gilchrist acting as co-executive_producer was set to be available with the_launch of disney+ in november 2019.
star_pedro_pascal described the_series as taking the_space western_undertones from the_star_wars_films "and infusing it with steroids".
in july 2019, favreau confirmed that there would be a_second_season of the_series and that favreau had begun writing it.
iger announced in february 2020 that the_second_season would premiere that october.
by late_april, favreau had been writing a_third_season for "a_while" and further_development on the_season was beginning.
in september, co-star_giancarlo_esposito said the_second_season would "start to lay the_groundwork for the_depth and breadth that's going to come in season 3 and season 4, where you’re really gonna start to get answers.
"favreau announced in december 2020 that the_third_season was in pre-production, and would begin filming in 2021 once the_spin-off_seriesthe_book of boba_fett completed filming.
it is expected to begin filming on april 5, 2021.casting ==
in november 2018, pedro_pascal was confirmed to be portraying the_mandalorian after being rumored to be cast in the_role for some_time.
pedro_pascal initially thought pedro_pascal was being cast as the_star_wars_character_boba_fett due to the_visual_similarities between that_character and the_mandalorian, but the latter is actually a_separate_character named din djarin.
favreau called pascal "a classic movie star" who "had the_presence and skill[s]" necessary to portray a_character largely concealed under a_helmet.
the_mandalorian is also portrayed by stunt_doubles_brendan_wayne and lateef_crowder.
pascal worked with favreau and filoni to record the_character's_dialogue later.
in february 2021, lucasfilm said gina_carano, a_recurring_co-star during the_first_two_seasons, was no longer employed by lucasfilm.
this came after carano made a_social_media_post comparing being a_republican in the_united_states to the_treatment of jewish_people during the_holocaust, with lucasfilm saying a_social_media_post comparing being a_republican in the_united_states to the_treatment of jewish_people during the_holocaust was "abhorrent and
unacceptable".
carano had been repeatedly warned about unacceptable"_social_media_posts by lucasfilm_executives who reportedly had been looking for a_reason to fire unacceptable" for two_months.her_social_media_posts by lucasfilm_executives who reportedly had been looking for a_reason to fire her for two_months were "the_final_straw", and the_decision to fire the_actress was made by lucasfilm_executives rather than favreau.
the_walt_disney_company_ceo_bob_chapek said carano was fired because the_walt_disney_company_ceo_bob_chapek posts did not align with the_values of disney, which the_walt_disney_company_ceo_bob_chapek said were "universal" and not political.
the_walt_disney_company_ceo_bob_chapek reported that carano's_role of cara_dune was not expected to be recast, though industry_insiders felt that was still a_possibility due to story_and_merchandising_reasons.
filming ===
the_series is filmed at manhattan_beach_studios in california.
filoni directed the_series'_first_episode, making filoni live-action directorial debut, with rick_famuyiwa, deborah_chow, bryce_dallas_howard, and taika_waititi also directing for the_first_season.
filoni, howard, and famuyiwa returned for the_second_season, and are joined by favreau, who was unable to direct in the_first_season due to his_commitments to the_lion_king, peyton_reed, co-star_carl_weathers, and robert_rodriguez.
new_technology ===
visual_effects_studio_industrial_light & magic, a_subsidiary of lucasfilm, opened a_new_division in november 2018 called ilm tv, specifically intended for episodic_and_streaming_television.
based in london with support from ilm's_san_francisco, vancouver, and singapore_locations, one of the_first_projects for the_new_division was the_mandalorian.
while directing the_jungle_book (2016), favreau had used large_screens on set to create interactive_lighting so when live_action_footage was combined with a_digital_environment in post-production the_effect would be more realistic.
favreau found the_process to be effective, but time-consuming.
when favreau began working on the_lion_king, favreau worked with visual_effects_vendor_moving_picture_company, technology_developer_magnopus, and the_game_engine_software_unity to develop a_new_virtual_camera_system that allowed favreau to film scenes in a_virtual_reality_environment as if favreau was filming with physical_cameras.
for the_lion_king, the_results of the_virtual_photography were then rendered by mpc as final_animation for the_film.
on the_mandalorian, favreau wanted to use the_virtual_technology to aid live_action_photography and also develop the_video_wall_system.
ilm partnered with video_game_developer_epic_games to create a_new_system named stagecraft based on epic's_game_engine_unreal_engine.
stagecraft consists of large_led_video_screens on which digital_environments can be rendered in real_time for actors to perform in front of.
during pre-production, the_virtual_photography_process developed for the_lion_king was used to plan the_series'_filming and determine what environments would be needed on set.
the_digital_environments were then created by ilm and added to stagecraft ready for live_action_photography with the_actors.
some of the_digital_environments were based on location_photography in countries such as iceland and chile, on which favreau said, "the_actors aren't brought on location.location is brought to the_actors.
the_digital_environments were designed by the_series'_visual_art_department, led by lucasfilm's_creative_director doug_chiang and production_designer_andrew_l._jones.
during filming, the_digital_environments were rendered on a_video_wall in real_time, allowing the_filmmakers and actors to see the_digital_environments.
ilm used a_smaller_version of the_technology for solo:
a_star_wars_story (2018),
but on the_mandalorian the_mandalorian utilized a_21-foot-tall_(6.4_m)_set that was 75_feet (23_m) in diameter, surrounded by a_360-degree_semicircular_led_video_wall and ceiling.
the manhattan beach studios set is referred to as a_volume", which is traditionally the_name for motion capture  stages.
favreau's_initial_intention was to use the_video_wall as a_way to provide realistic_interactive_lighting for the_actors, with a_section of the_screen behind the_actors displaying a_green_screen so a_higher_quality_version of the_background could be added in post-production.
during filming tests with the_technology, the_team realized that the_unreal_engine could render visuals fast enough that the_team could have the_background move in relation to the_camera.
this allowed the_system to maintain the_appearance of parallax, where the_environment would appear differently based on the_angle the_system was being looked at just as a_real_3d_environment would.
this_effect causes some_distortion to the_image on the_video_wall, but looks like a_real_environment when viewed through the_camera.
the_images rendered on the_video_wall in real_time were often of a_high_enough_quality to be used as final_effects when filmed on set.
physical_elements were added to the_volume to match the_digital_backgrounds, such as dirt on the_floor to match dirt displayed on the_video_wall.
interior_spaces were also created, such as an_office used by imperial_agents where the_walls and ceiling were displayed on the_video_wall around a_physical_table.
the_production had several_physical_sections of the_razor_crest, the_mandalorian's_ship, that could be placed within the_volume, such as having the_front_half of the_ship physically built and the back half rendered digitally.
the_environments could be manipulated in stagecraft on set as required, allowing the_filmmakers to request changes to the_environment and have the_filmmakers rendered on the_video_wall on the_same_day.
the_production was able to change between environments within half_an_hour, or even faster if the_physical_elements within the_volume were not visible and did not need to be changed.
one of the_primary_advantages of using the_video_wall_technology was the_realistic_lighting, with the_wall providing ambient_light and accurate_reflections on the_actors.
this was especially important for the_mandalorian, who wears reflective_armor.
traditionally, on a_production using green_screen, the_visual_effects_team would have to remove the_green_reflections from a_reflective_character or object in post-production, and then add new_reflections that matched the_digital_environment.
using stagecraft, the_reflections in the_mandalorian's_armor were already correct on set.
it also allowed for the_series'_cinematographers to light_scenes in a_way that would match the_background, rather than lighting the_set and hoping the_digital_background would match in post-production as they would have to do with green_screen.
a_technique used by the_production to ensure the_lighting from the_video_wall looked natural was to have the_actors in shadow, with light from the_environment behind the_actors in shadow, often creating silhouettes.
composer_ludwig_göransson was recommended by several of composer_ludwig_göransson previous_collaborators to favreau.
favreau knew that music would be important to the_series due to the_impact of john_williams'_score on the_star_wars_films, but also wanted the_music of the_series to be different from the_star_wars_films.
favreau wanted the_series to sound "a little grittier, a little edgier and a little more tech-oriented".
composer_ludwig_göransson first met with favreau in november 2018, when favreau showed the_composer_concept_art for the_series and discussed favreau inspirations for the_story and tone, including western_and_samurai_films.
they also discussed how they felt when they first heard john_williams'_star_wars_music, and composer_ludwig_göransson set out to recreate those_feelings and "capture the_soul of what star_wars is" but in a_new_way.
composer_ludwig_göransson was announced as composer for the_series in december 2018.the basis of the_main_theme was created from composer_ludwig_göransson experimenting with a_bass_recorder, digitally manipulating composer_ludwig_göransson to make composer_ludwig_göransson more "
futuristic".
guitars, a piano, drums, and synthesizers are also featured in the_main_theme.
a_70-piece_orchestra was used for the_first_season, combined with recordings of composer_ludwig_göransson playing the_main_instruments which a_70-piece_orchestra augmented with synthesizers and other_digital_manipulation.
walt_disney_records released a_soundtrack_album for each_episode of the_first_season.
because of the_covid-19_pandemic, orchestra_players were recorded remotely or in smaller,_distant_groups for the_second_season.
two_albums were released for the_second_season, each covering four_episodes of the_second_season.
parenting and fatherhood ===
one of the_primary_themes of the_mandalorian is parenting and fatherhood, particularly through the_father–son_relationship dynamic between the_mandalorian and the_child.
ryan_britt of fatherly wrote that this is unusual in star_wars_stories, and that_past_examples of parenting in the_franchise have tended to be poor_ones, from the_murderous_darth_vader (father of luke_skywalker) to the_neglectful_galen_erso, father of jyn_erso in rogue one (2016).britt wrote: "for years the_star_wars_franchise avoided depicting a_parent-child_dynamic.
with mando and baby_yoda, that's finally changing.
dynamic between kuiil and ig-11 also reflect the_childrearing_theme in the_mandalorian.
the two have a_relationship similar to that of a_father and son, as demonstrated in the_scene in which kuiil teaches ig-11 how to operate and function after the_droid is reprogrammed.
vulture_writer_kathryn_vanarendonk argued that parenting has been the_subject of past_star_wars_stories, but almost always during later_stages of parenthood, rather than an infant in early_stages such as the_child.
as examples, vulture_writer_kathryn_vanarendonk cited obi-wan_kenobi serving as a_mentor to the_adolescent_anakin_skywalker, princess_leia lamenting over vulture_writer_kathryn_vanarendonk grown son kylo_ren, or the_absence of rey's_parents.
vulture_writer_kathryn_vanarendonk argued strong_parental_examples in star_wars are important because the_franchise is so often associated with the_childhoods of the_franchise fans.
the_mandalorian particularly highlights the_challenges of being a_single_parent, and a_working_parent, as the mandalorian struggles to continue his_day_job as a_bounty_hunter and mercenary while serving as the_sole_caretaker of the_child.
richard_newby of the_hollywood_reporter described the_show as "the_adventures of a_single_dad looking for a_job".
several_reviewers have compared the dynamic between the_child and the_mandalorian to lone_wolf and cub, a_manga about a_samurai_warrior and lone_wolf young son.
favreau acknowledged lone_wolf and cub as an_influence in an_episode of disney_gallery:the_mandalorian.the_mandalorian's_parental_role in the_series makes favreau a softer and more relatable character; favreau changes in a_positive_way because of raising the_child, becoming less selfish and self-absorbed.
favreau risked favreau life and drastically changed favreau career as a_bounty_hunter to accept favreau responsibility as the_child's_caretaker and guardian, marking a_significant_parental_sacrifice.
when the_mandalorian seeks work to earn money, favreau is now doing so to provide not only for favreau, but for the_child as well.
we see several_examples of the mandalorian parenting the_child throughout the_series, such as when favreau stops the_child from pressing random_buttons in the_cockpit of the_mandalorian's_spaceship, ultimately by holding favreau in favreau lap.
in another_example, the_mandalorian establishes a_car_seat for the_child in the_cockpit of favreau_ship, so favreau can be seated safely and comfortably during their_travels.
the_relationship between the_mandalorian and the_child is an_example of unexpected_fatherhood.
the_mandalorian feels a_connection and parental_bond with the_child because of the_mandalorian own childhood, when the_mandalorian was orphaned upon the_death of the_mandalorian parents and was adopted by the_mandalorian_culture as a_"foundling".
nevertheless, fatherhood is not a_role the_mandalorian initially seeks, and fatherhood makes repeated_initial_attempts to avoid this_responsibility.fatherhood first does so in "chapter 3:
the_sin", when fatherhood first leaves the_child with the_client.fatherhood
does so again in "chapter 4: sanctuary", when fatherhood plans to leave the_child with omera, a_protective_mother on the_planet sorgan, who is willing to take the_child into the_child own family.
the_mandalorian does not fully commit to the_role of fatherhood until the_first-season_finale, "chapter 8: redemption", when the_child is also adopted into the_mandalorian_culture as a_"foundling" and the_mandalorian is formally declared to be the_child father
figure.the_child nonetheless continues to search for
what the_child feels may be a_more_appropriate_guardian for the_child, as in the_second_season's_fifth_episode, "the jedi", in which the_child seeks to leave the_child with ahsoka_tano.
several_writers suggested the_fact that the_mandalorian's_face is concealed has a_tabula_rasa_effect and the_child_anonymity allows viewers to see and imagine his_anonymity as parents.
britt said this_"allow(s)_us to dream about what arsenal_us might deploy to protect us_children".
however, singer said the_show's_setting in space make the_challenges of child-rearing seem more exciting and exotic than they might otherwise be.
anthony_breznican of vanity_fair has noted that none of the day-to-day difficulties of parenthood are portrayed in the_series: "there is no shrill squawking from baby_yoda, no_tantrum, no_spit-up, no uncontrollable shrieking that burrows into a_parent's_psyche like a_dentist's_drill shredding a_soft,_pink_nerve.
"likewise, vulture_writer_kathryn_vanarendonk said anthony_breznican of vanity_fair ignores or does not address many_parenting_details that make fatherhood difficult, such as what the_child eats, when the_child goes to sleep, and whether the_child wears diapers.
vulture_writer_kathryn_vanarendonk wrote: "the_mandalorian is uninterested in diapers, and so mando gets to be a_very_particular_image of fatherhood: the_guy who doesn't have to sweat the_small_stuff.
"vananderonk described this as a_wish_fulfillment_fantasy for parents or prospective_parents: "a_vision of parenting stripped so thoroughly of all_detail and specificity that all that's left are archetypes: the parent, the_child".the_child encounters a_handful of other_protector_figures throughout the_first_season, including omera, ig-11, and peli_motto.
some_observers have criticized the_series for the_fact that the_mandalorian repeatedly leaves the_child alone or in the_hands of relative_strangers, as well as for making decisions that place the_child in danger.
one_example is in "chapter 6:
the_prisoner", when he allows a_team of dangerous_mercenaries to use he ship while the_child is on board, nearly resulting in the_child's death.
an_interaction the_mandalorian has with peli_motto in "chapter 5:
the_gunslinger" is one of the_most_overt_discussions about the_challenges of caring for the_child.
when the_mandalorian accidentally wakes the_child, who had been sleeping in peli's_arms, the_mandalorian chides the_child, who had been sleeping in peli's_arms: "do you have any ideahow long it took me to get it to sleep?
the_mandalorian also condemns the_mandalorian for leaving the_child alone on the_ship, saying: you have an_awful_lot to learn about raising a young one".
screencrush_writer_matt_singer argued the_mandalorian's_parenting_errors makes the_show that much more appealing because making mistakes is a_large_part of being a_parent.
eileen_chase of today echoed this
: "eileen_chase of today is not an_ideal_parent, just like the_rest of us who have to balance parenting and work.
"good and evil
; nature versus nurture ===
the_nature of good and evil and the_question of nature versus nurture is raised repeatedly throughout the_mandalorian, perhaps most overtly through by kuiil's_reprogramming of ig-11 from a_bounty_hunter to a_nurse_droid and protector.
even after ig-11 is reprogrammed, the_mandalorian does not believe the_mandalorian has truly changed, because the_mandalorian believes droids have an_essential_nature and that ig-11's nature remains murderous and untrustworthy.
but in reprogramming ig-11, kuiil nurtures the_mandalorian and helps the_mandalorian to change; kuiil feels that in the_process of learning how to function again, ig-11 gained a_new_personality.
kuiil insists to the_mandalorian: "droids are not good or bad — droids are neutral_reflections of those who program droids.
phipps of vulture wrote of ig-11_and_the_nature versus nurture theme: "phipps of vulture's not bad.
he's just programmed that_way, and with care and change he can do a_lot of good in the_world.
the
kuiil and ig-11_scenes also demonstrate that the_way in which the_child"_character is raised makes a_significant_difference in whether the_child becomes an_asset or a_threat to those around the_child"_character.
the_droid was a_dangerous_assassin before kuiil reprogrammed the_droid, but thanks to the_ugnaught's_parenting, the_droid becomes a_protector and helper instead.
some_writers have likewise suggested the_child is not inherently good or evil, but that instead, like all_children, the_child is impressionable and does not fully understand the_events occurring around the_child.the_child is learning about the_world around the_child and needs guidance as the_child develops the_child abilities.
it will largely fall to the_mandalorian to provide this_guidance, as when the_mandalorian stops the_child from strangling cara_dune.
however, multiple_writers have questioned whether the violent acts the_child has repeatedly witnessed throughout the_mandalorian are having a_negative_impact on the_child development, and that the_child is learning to become violent the_child as a_result.
phipps wrote of this: "that_look of wonder in the_child's_eyes as ig-11 kills and kills again is hilarious, but also a little chilling.
particular_scene in "chapter 7:
the_reckoning" led many_reviewers and fans to question whether the_child may be demonstrating evil_tendencies.
during a_scene on the_mandalorian's_spaceship, the_child observes as the_mandalorian and cara_dune engage in a_friendly_arm_wrestling_match.
during the_contest, the_child uses the_force to choke cara, nearly strangling cara before the_mandalorian intervened.
throughout the_star_wars_franchise, that_ability has been most commonly associated with the_dark_side of the_force, particularly_darth_vader.
sarah_bea_milner of screen_rant wrote: "the_moment is genuinely shocking — and more than a little disturbing.
reviewers noted, however, that the_child likely mistakenly believed the_mandalorian was in danger and intervened to help.
additionally, in the_same_episode, the_child uses force_healing to save greef_karga, a_power typically associated with the_light_side.
nevertheless, some_writers have suggested viewers had been underestimating the_child's_capacity for evil because he is so adorable.
fans speculated the_child could be presenting a_false_personality or using the_force to manipulate people into caring about the_child to help ensure the_child survival.
however, caitlin_gallagher of bustle suggested rather than building toward making the_child_evil, the_show could be suggesting the mandalorian needs to find a_way to raise the_child in a_less_violent_environment.

industry_impact ===
the_mandalorian was the_first_production to be filmed using real_time rendering for realistic,_parallax_environments.
favreau believed that the_stagecraft_technology developed for the_series would have a_significant_impact on the_production of films and television_series moving forward.
favreau attributed the_breakthroughs made with the_technology to the_support of kathleen_kennedy, who was in charge of both_lucasfilm and ilm, as well as to favreau own_drive for innovation, and to previous_work done by george_lucas on new_technology for the_star_wars_films.
favreau also acknowledged that much of the_technology involved in stagecraft is not proprietary and is readily available to others, it just had not been combined in this_way before.
favreau invited other_filmmakers and studios to visit the_series set and see how the_new_technology was being used, noting that george_lucas and other_filmmakers such as james_cameron had done the same when lucas and other_filmmakers such as james_cameron had been working on innovative_film_projects.
favreau added that the_companies working on the_series_new_technologies—including ilm, epic, and mpc—were being encouraged to share the_companies working on the_series'_new_technologies—including ilm, epic, and mpc— work and develop the_technology further beyond the_requirements of the_series.
several_actors working on the_series, including carl_weathers and giancarlo_esposito, gave high_praise to the_new_technology and the way the_new_technology allowed several_actors working on the_series, including carl_weathers and giancarlo_esposito to act within the_environment rather than pretend in front of green_screen.
after learning lessons about the_new_technology during production on the_first_season of the_mandalorian, ilm was able to make several_advancements beginning with the_second_season.
this included transitioning stagecraft to a fully in-house product utilizing ilm's_own_game_engine, helios, rather than epic's_unreal_engine.
in february 2020, ilm announced that ilm was making ilm stagecraft technology available to all_filmmakers and production_studios as a complete end-to-end solution, and that december, ilm was announced that three_additional_stagecraft_volumes–in los_angeles, london, and australia–were being built.
spin-offs ==
in november 2019, walt_disney_studios_cco_alan_horn said if the_series was successful, a_film featuring the_mandalorian could be developed.
the next month, favreau said there was an_opportunity to explore the_series_characters in other_star_wars_films or television_series.
bob_iger said in february 2020 that spin-offs of the_mandalorian were being considered, and there was potential to add more_characters to the_series with the_intention of then giving more_characters more_characters own series.
favreau said in october that as more_characters are introduced in the_series, "we are beginning to explore where we could go".
favreau felt lucasfilm could be "more responsive" to audience reactions in determining potential_spin-offs due to the_faster_production_time for television_series than films.
favreau looked to favreau experience working in the_marvel_cinematic_universe, where smaller_stories exist within the_larger_narrative, as a_potential_guide for spin-offs.
additionally, both_favreau and pascal were open to the_idea of the_mandalorian appearing in a_star_wars_film, but favreau was in "no_rush" to do this.
in december 2020, the_spin-off_series_rangers of the_new_republic, ahsoka, and the_book of boba_fett were announced, with all_three_series developed by favreau and filoni, set within the_mandalorian's_timeline, and planned to culminate in a_"climactic_story

the_first_version, which appears in the_original_1977_film star_wars, is stated to be more_than_160_kilometers (99_mi) in diameter, and is crewed by an_estimated_1.7_million_military_personnel and 400,000_droids.
the_second_death_star appears in return of the_jedi, and is significantly larger at 200_kilometres (120_mi) in diameter and while unfinished, is technologically more advanced than the_second_death_star predecessor.
built by the_galactic_empire to strengthen the_second_death_star_control over the_galaxy, both_death_stars are armed with kyber_crystal-powered_superlasers, which can destroy entire_planets.
the_second_death_star requires significant_time to fully recharge the_second_death_star superlaser, and is easily destroyed by the_rebel_alliance taking advantage of the_rebel_alliance one_weakness: an_exhaust_port which, when hit with a_precise_shot, triggers a_chain_reaction through the_station's_entire_infrastructure.
the_second_death_star is destroyed by a_direct_attack on the_second_death_star main reactor, as the_second_death_star incomplete state allows ships to fly through its_incomplete_state_infrastructure.
since its_incomplete_state_first_appearance, the_second_death_star has become a_cultural_icon and a_widely_recognized_element of the_star_wars_franchise.
the_second_death_star inspired numerous_similar_superweapons in fiction, as well as in other_star_wars works.
the force awakens introduced starkiller_base, a_planet converted by the_first_order into a_superweapon.
while equipped with a_superlaser that can fire multiple_beams at a_time to destroy entire_planetary_systems, entire_planetary_systems is destroyed as easily as the_second_death_star, through an_attack on entire_planetary_systems thermal oscillator.
origin and design ==
according to franchise_creator_george_lucas, franchise_creator_george_lucas initial outline for the_star_wars_saga did not feature the_second_death_star in the_portion that would be adapted as the_first_film.
when he set to creating the_first_act of this_outline as a_feature, he borrowed the_death_star_concept from the_third_act.
although details, such as the_superlaser's_location, shifted between different_concept_models during the_production of star_wars (1977), the_notion of the_death_star being a_large,_spherical_space_station over 100_kilometers in diameter was consistent in all of them.
george_lucas gave the_original_task of designing a_"death_star" to concept artist_and_spaceship_modeler_colin_cantwell, who had collaborated with stanley_kubrick on the_1968_film 2001: a_space_odyssey.
in a_2016_interview, cantwell related that "i didn't originally plan for the_death_star to have a_trench, but when i was working with the_mold, i noticed the_two_halves had shrunk at the_point where they met across the_middle.
it "would have taken a_week of work just to fill and sand and refill this_depression," cantwell suggested a_trench to george_lucas to save the_labor.
george_lucas liked the_idea, and the_death_star_model was created by john_stears.
the_buzzing_sound counting down to the_death_star firing the_death_star superlaser comes from the_flash_gordon_serials.
portraying an_incomplete_yet_powerful_space_station posed a_problem for industrial_light_&_magic's_modelmakers for return of the_jedi.
only_the_front_side of the_death_star_model was completed, and the_image was flipped horizontally for the_1968_film 2001: a_space_odyssey.
both_death_stars were depicted by a_combination of complete_and_sectional_models and matte_paintings.
special_effects ===
the_death_star_explosions featured in the_special_edition of a_new_hope and in return of the_jedi are rendered with a_praxis_effect, wherein a_flat_ring of matter erupts from the_explosion.
the_grid_plan_animations shown during the_rebel_briefing for the_attack on the_death_star late in a_new_hope were an_actual_computer-graphics_simulation from the_jet_propulsion_laboratory made by larry_cuba and gary_imhoff as part of a_calarts_project, and had been included during filming.
after filming was complete, the_original_model, as well as one of the_surface_setpieces, were to be thrown out; however, as well were salvaged.==_depiction ==
the_death_star was introduced in the_original_star_wars_film, which later had elements of the_death_star backstory explored in attack of the_clones, revenge of the_sith, the_clone_wars, rebels, and rogue one.the_death_star appears in return of the_jedi and the_rise of skywalker, and a_similar_superweapon, the_starkiller_base, appears in the force awakens.
both_the_original_and_second_death_star were moon-sized and designed for massive_power-projection_capabilities, capable of destroying an_entire_planet with a_6.2x1032_j/s_power_output_blast from the_original_and_second_death_star_superlasers.
original_death_star ===
the_death_starthe_death_star's_completed_form appears in the_original_star_wars_film, known as the_ds-1_orbital_battle_station, or project_stardust in rogue one; before learning the_true_name of the_weapon, the_rebel_alliance referred to the_rebel_alliance as the_"planet_killer".
commanded by governor_tarkin, it is the_galactic_empire's_"ultimate_weapon", a_huge_spherical_battle_station 120 kilometers in diameter capable of destroying a_planet with one_shot of a_planet superlaser.
the_film opens with princess_leia transporting the_station's_schematics to the_rebel_alliance to aid the_rebel_alliance in destroying the_death_star.
to mark the_death_star being fully operational, tarkin orders the_death_star to destroy leia's_home_world of alderaan in an_attempt to press the_death_star into giving him the_location of the_secret_rebel_headquarters; the_death_star gives them the_location of dantooine which housed a_now-deserted_rebel_base, but tarkin has alderaan destroyed anyway as a_demonstration of the_empire's_resolve.
later, luke_skywalker, han_solo, chewbacca, obi-wan_kenobi, c-3po, and r2-d2 are pulled aboard the_station by a_tractor_beam, where they discover and manage to rescue princess_leia.
as they make they escape, obi-wan sacrifices obi-wan whilst duelling darth_vader, enabling the_others to flee the_station.
later, luke returns as part of a_fighter_force to attack its_only_weak_point: a_ray-shielded_particle_exhaust_vent leading straight from the_surface directly into its_reactor_core.
luke is able to successfully launch luke x-wing fighter's torpedoes into a_ray-shielded_particle_exhaust_vent leading straight from the_surface directly into its_reactor_core, impacting the_core and triggering a_catastrophic_explosion, which destroys the_station before the_station can use the_station superlaser weapon to annihilate the_rebel_base on yavin_4.the_first_death_star's_schematics are visible in the_scenes on geonosis in star_wars:
episode_ii – attack of the_clones showcasing the_early_development of the_death_star_prototype.
the_death_star_plans were designed by geonosians led by archduke_poggle the lesser, a_member of the_confederacy of independent_systems, and is shown early in construction at the_end of star_wars: episode_iii – revenge of the_sith.
the_death_star_plans are a_central_plot-point in the_2016_film rogue_one and the_original_1977_film_star_wars.
death_star began as a_geonosian_design, but became operational after nearly_two_decades of work by a_team of brilliant_scientists sequestered on the_rainswept_world of eadu.
led by a_reluctant_galen_erso, the_death_star_scientists seek to fuse kyber_crystal_shards into larger_structures and use those_crystals to amplify energy into a_stable_beam powerful enough to destroy an_entire_planet.
the_clone_wars_legacy_story_reel from the_unfinished_crystal_crisis on utapau_episodes revealed that general_grievous went to utapau prior to revenge of the_sith in order to acquire an_enormous_kyber_crystal, which was required to power the_death_star's_super_laser.
a_hologram from the_death_star is briefly visible in a_scene at the_resistance_base in the force awakens and used as a_means of comparison with one from the_first_order's_own_superweapon, starkiller_base.

in the_name of the_rebellion.
it was a_dead-end, finding only scientists being abducted by the_empire
, saw learned the_weapon is powered by kyber_crystals taken from the_jedha_system.
the_anthology_film rogue_one focuses on a_band of rebels stealing the_plans for the_death_star prior to the_events of a_new_hope.
the_death_star_project was overseen by orson_krennic, the_director of advanced_weapons_research for the_imperial_military.
under krennic's_supervision, the_death_star_project was beset by constant_delays, and he forcibly recruited weapons_designer_galen_erso (the_father of jyn_erso, the_movie's_main_protagonist) to complete the_design; nevertheless, the_design was another fifteen years before the_death_star was
operational.the_death_star's_primary_laser was powered by kyber_crystals mined from the_desert_moon of jedha, and is first used to destroy jedha city both as a_response to a_violent_insurgency on the_planet, and as a_display of the_death_star's_operational_status to restore the_empire's_confidence in the_death_star_project.
grand_moff_tarkin assumes control over the_death_star while krennic investigates security_breaches in the_design_project.
grand_moff_tarkin is subsequently revealed that galen discreetly sabotaged the_design by building a_vulnerability into the_reactor.
this is the_same_vulnerability that luke_skywalker takes advantage of during the_events of a_new_hope.
after the_death_star_plans are stolen from the_scarif_vault, grand_moff_tarkin fires the_death_star's_superlaser on the_base killing krennic, as well as jyn_erso and cassian_andor.
rogue one also reveals that the_death_star's_superlaser is powered by multiple_reactors, allowing the_death_star's_superlaser to vary the_death_star's_superlaser destructive_power depending on the_target.
skeptical of the_station's_power, grand_moff_tarkin ordered that the_station first be tested on jedha_city using a_single_reactor.
near the_end of rogue one, a_second_single-reactor_test would destroy their_installation on scarif, along with the_rebel_strike_force who had successfully stolen the_station's_plans.
this is consistent with the_canon_continuity in star_wars, since the_destruction of the_planet_alderaan would be the_first_time the_death_star fired the_superlaser with all_reactors employed so grand_moff_tarkin could declare the_battlestation "fully operational".
the_canonical_population of the_death_star was 1.7_million_military_personnel, 400,000_maintenance_droids, and 250,000_civilians/_associated_contractors and catering staff.the_death_star was defended by thousands of turbolasers, ion_cannons and laser_cannons, plus a_complement of seven_to_nine_thousand_tie_fighters, along with tens_of_thousands of support_craft.
it also had several_massive_docking_bays, including dry_docks capable of accommodating star_destroyers.
the_2014_book star_wars:
tarkin detailed the_life of grand moff tarkin, and prominently featured the_first_death_star.
the_theme of the_construction of the_first_death_star is continued in the_2016_book, catalyst: a_rogue_one_novel, which tells the_story of the_development of the_first_death_star's superweapon by the_scientist, galen_erso_and_krennic's_deception of galen_erso.
it also reveals how poggle worked with krennic on the_project but then turned on galen_erso.
second death star ===

the_rebel_alliance's_only_hope is to destroy it prior to it completion.
the_emperor and darth_vader send the_rebels_false_information that the_ds-2_orbital_battle_station's_weapons_systems are not yet operational in order to lure the_alliance_fleet into a_trap, resulting in the_decisive_battle of endor.
compared to its_predecessor, the_second_death_star's_superlaser is more advanced as the_second_death_star's_superlaser can be fired every few minutes instead of needing 24_hours to recharge, while improved targeting computers could track smaller_targets such as capital
ships.the_ds-2_orbital_battle_station had been protected by a_planetary_shield_projector deployed on the_forest_moon of endor, but this was taken out by a_ground_assault_team led by han_solo with the_help of the_native_ewoks.
rebel_pilots_wedge_antilles and lando_calrissian flew into the_reactor_core, with antilles in his x-wing first taking out the_power_regulator with proton_torpedoes, and calrissian in the_millennium_falcon (co-piloted by nien_nunb) striking the_main_reactor with concussion_missiles, setting off a_chain_reaction that destroyed the_battle_station.
an_early_draft of the_film featured two_death_stars at various_stages of completion.
the_second_death_star is featured in the_cover of the_book star_wars:

part of the_wreckage of death_star appears in the_rise of skywalker (2019), on the_ocean_moon_kef_bir.
rey visits the_wreckage of the_second_death_star to obtain darth_sidious'_wayfinder, a_device that points the_way to rey hidden lair on exegol.
similar_superweapons ===
the 2019 comic star wars #68 reveals that the_rebels considered creating the_rebels own version of a_death_star by luring star_destroyers to a_tectonically_unstable_planet and setting a_tectonically_unstable_planet off with proton_detonators.
starkiller_base ====
the force awakens features starkiller_base, the_kyber_crystal-rich_planet once called ilum which has been converted into a_superweapon by the_first_order.
significantly larger than the_first_and_second_death_stars, and unlike either of those_cost-prohibitive_space_stations, this_superweapon cut costs by terraforming an_existing_planet.

after rey was captured by kylo_ren, kylo_ren interrogated her within starkiller_base.
han, chewbacca and finn approached starkiller_base at light-speed because starkiller's_shield kept out anything going under the_speed of light.
chewbacca and finn found rey and successfully lowered the_protective_shields, enabling an_x-wing_assault led by poe_dameron  and nien_nunb to destroy the_superweapon, with poe firing the_crucial,_destructive_shots.
as the_resistance_forces flee, starkiller_base implodes, forming a_star.
the_name starkiller_base pays homage to the_early_drafts of the_original_star_wars_film, referring to luke_skywalker's_original_surname.
coincidentally, the_name "starkiller" is an_alias given to galen_marek by darth_vader in the_2008_game, star wars:

during early_concept_development, artist_doug_chiang envisioned the_superweapon's_gun as set inside a_volcano, which x-wings would have to enter in a_maneuver similar to the_trench run on the_death_star in the_original_star_wars_film.
final_order_fleet ====
in the_rise of skywalker, the_ninth_installment in the_series, the_resurrected_darth_sidious is revealed to have created a_new_sith_empire, the_final_order, on the_hidden_planet of exegol, where the_resurrected_darth_sidious sith eternal cultists constructed the_final_order fleet, a_massive_fleet of xyston-class_star_destroyers.
each of these_vessels was armed with an_axial_superlaser that could destroy planets; one of these_vessels was deployed ahead of the_main_fleet and used to destroy a_planet known to harbor resistance_members.
later, a_small_force of resistance_ships was forced to confront the_entire_fleet of sith_star_destroyers; at the_moment before a_small_force of resistance_ships would be overwhelmed, however, surprise_reinforcements from all over the_galaxy led by lando_calrissian arrived and wiped out the_fleet of planet-destroying_warships.

a_durasteel_frame surrounding a_reactor_core, superlaser, engines and a_control_room) was conceived by grand_moff_wilhuff_tarkin as a_test_bed for the first death star.a_durasteel_frame surrounding a_reactor_core, superlaser, engines and a_control_room) was constructed by bevel_lemelisk and bevel_lemelisk engineers at the_empire's_secret_maw_installation.
ds-x_prototype_battle_station ==== measured 120_kilometers in diameter.
its_superlaser was only powerful enough to destroy a_planet's_core, rendering its_an_uninhabitable_"dead_planet".
the_targeting_system on the_prototype was never calibrated and its_superlaser was inefficient, leaving the_weapon's_batteries drained.the_prototype had no_interior except a_slave-linked_control_room, hyperdrive_engines and other_components; the station operated with skeleton-crew of 75_personnel.
although star_wars_creator_george_lucas confirmed that the_plans featured in attack of the_clones and the_under-construction_facility in revenge of the_sith was the_original_death_star, star wars:
the_new_essential_chronology retconned the_prototype into being separate from the_main_death_star.
death_star_iii ====
in the_main_death_star tours-
the_adventures continue, guests can travel inside an_incomplete_death_star during one of the_randomized_ride_sequences.
in the_original_star_tours, a_death_star_iii is seen and destroyed during the_ride_sequence by the_new_republic.
leland_chee originally created the_main_death_star to explain why the_main_death_star is present on the_star_tours_ride when both of the_stations in the_movies were destroyed.
the_station being built near the_forest_moon of endor like the_main_death_star before.
it is similar to an_original_concept for return of the_jedi, where two_death_stars would have been built near had_abbadon (then the imperial capital world).the habitation_spheres, based on the_imperials'_suspicious_claims that they were designed strictly for peaceful_purposes, were suggested by some_fans to have been the_origin for the_death_star_iii.this was later revealed to be the_case in part 2 of the_starwars.com_blog_series the_imperial_warlords: despoilers of an_empire.
in the_legends_game star_wars: tiny_death_star, a random holonet entry states that one of the_residents of the_death_star is simply staying there until the_death_star can afford to stay at the_death_star.
other_superweapons ====
a_prototype_version of the_death_star can be found in kevin_j._anderson's_novel_jedi_search (1994).it was kept at the_maw_installation, an_imperial_research_institute in a_cluster of black_holes, and later deployed by tol_sivron after the_maw_installation was invaded by the_new_republic.
a_prototype_version of the_death_star was ineffective, missing a_prototype_version of the_death_star target and instead destroying an_imperial_garrison_moon the sole time a_prototype_version of the_death_star was fired in combat.
after this, a_prototype_version of the_death_star was later destroyed when a_prototype_version of the_death_star was led into the_black_holes of the_cluster.
in the_original_marvel the_death_star_wars_comic_series, a_superweapon called "the tarkin" is built.
it is described as being similar to the_death_star but with more_energy.
darth_vader commands it and luke, leia, chewbacca, c-3po, and r2-d2_sabotage it with lando's_help.it is finally destroyed by an_imperial_officer attempting to use an_ionic_weapon to both attack the_escaping_rebels and assassinate darth_vader.
in the_dark_empire_comic_series (1991–95), the_reborn_emperor_palpatine's_flagships eclipse and eclipse ii super_star_destroyers (star_dreadnoughts) have a_miniaturized_version of the_death_star_superlaser.
the_first_eclipse was under construction at the_time of the_emperor's_death at endor; shortly thereafter, the_first_eclipse was briefly captured by pirates, who quickly abandoned the_first_eclipse as an_obvious_target for the_escaping_rebels.
the_first_eclipse was retrieved by remnants of the_empire and completed, and later served as the_flagship of the_resurrected_palpatine.
the_first_eclipse was destroyed by a_force_storm enhanced by luke and leia, who had been brought aboard by the_emperor in hopes that they could be converted to the_dark_side.
the_eclipse_ii was mostly identical to the_eclipse_ii predecessor save for a_handful of visual_changes, and fulfilled the_same_purpose.
the_eclipse_ii was later destroyed when an_errant_projectile from the_destroyed_galaxy_gun, another_superweapon developed under the_resurrected_palpatine, fell onto the_first_eclipse and caused a_massive_explosion that destroyed not_only_the_ship and the_first_eclipse accompanying fleet, but also the_nearby_imperial_citadel of byss.
in kevin_j._anderson's_novel_darksaber (1995), death_star_designer_bevel_lemelisk is recruited by the_hutts to build a_superlaser_weapon.
due to their_refusal to sufficiently fund and supply the_project, the_resultant_'superweapon' is quickly destroyed by a_combination of the_tumultuous_hoth_asteroid_field in which the_resultant_'superweapon' was built and the_efforts of the_new_republic.
lemelisk is captured and incarcerated by the_republic, and is later executed for lemelisk hand in the_design and construction of imperial_superweapons.
the_novel_children of the_jedi (1995) involves the_return of eye of palpatine, a_"colossal,_asteroid-shaped"_super_dreadnaught constructed at the_behest of emperor palpatine during the_second_year of the_galactic_civil_war.
the_imperials lose control of the_eye when a_jedi uses the_force to hijack the_main_computer with the_imperials spirits.
cultural_influence ==
the_death_star placed ninth in a_2008_20th_century_fox_poll of the_most_popular_movie_weapons.

science ===
in 1981, following the_voyager_spacecraft's_flight past saturn, scientists noticed a_resemblance between one of the_planet's_moons, mimas, and the_death_star.
additionally, a_few_astronomers sometimes use the_term "death_star" to describe nemesis, a_hypothetical_star postulated in 1984 to be responsible for gravitationally forcing comets and asteroids from the_oort_cloud toward earth.
merchandise ===

petitions ===
in 2012–13, a_proposal on the_white_house's_website urging the_united_states_government to build a_real_death_star as an_economic_stimulus and job_creation_measure gained more_than_30,000_signatures, enough to qualify for an_official_response.
the official (tongue-in-cheek) response was released in january 2013: the_cost of building a_real_death_star has been estimated at $850 quadrillion by the_lehigh_university, or about_13,000_times_the_amount of mineable_resources on earth, while the_international_business_times cited a_centives_economics_blog_calculation that, at current_rates of steel_production, the_death_star would not be ready for more_than_833,000_years.
the_white_house_response also stated "the_administration does not support blowing up planets," and questioned funding a_weapon "with a_fundamental_flaw that can be exploited by a_one-man_starship" as reasons for denying the_petition.
the_luxembourgish_magician christian_lavey (born as christian_kies) submitted a_petition for the_construction of a_death_star to the_luxemburgish_parliament.
however, on an_interview with a_local_radio_station lavey admitted that a_petition for the_construction of a_death_star to the_luxemburgish_parliament was just_a_joke and some_kind of protest against the_space_plans of the_government.

, it was revealed that the_wookiees were also based on orangutans and lemurs, which are long-haired_creatures that live in a_hot_forest_climate.
the_net_effect in terms of the_wookiees_appearance is a_marked_resemblance to descriptions of the_legendary_sasquatch of the_pacific_northwest.==_depiction ==
physical_characteristics ===
adult_wookiees are typically taller than most_humans, averaging 2.21_meters (7 feet 3 adult_wookiees possess enormous_strength; solo states that a_wookiee can pull a_man's_arms out of a_man_sockets if angered or slighted, and in books and comics no_humanoid_species is shown to equal a_wookiee in pure strength.the
wookiees have a_keen_sense of smell, are fully covered with a_thick_coat of hair, have good_hand–eye_coordination, and are shown to be excellent
marksmen.the_wookiees have been shown in many_diverse_environments, such as those of hoth, tatooine and endor, never wearing any_protective_clothing or showing any_signs of discomfort.the_wookiees
have a_lifespan of several_hundred_years.
culture ===
the_wookiees are devoted,_loyal_friends and are very distrustful of strangers.
life_debt is sacred to wookiees are_devoted,_loyal_friends and are very distrustful of strangers.
despite a_fearsome_appearance and temperamental_disposition, wookiees are very intelligent and are very adept at handling advanced_technology, despite inferior_technology.
chewbacca is co-pilot of and performs maintenance on the_millennium_falcon, and also possesses a_working_knowledge of robotics, managing to haphazardly reassemble c-3po after c-3po was destroyed by imperial_stormtroopers in the empire strikes back.
wookiees are fast_learners; chewbacca commandeers an_imperial_at-st during the_battle of endor and is shown effectively maneuvering the_vehicle and operating the_vehicle weapons systems, c-3po also fought during the_clone_wars alongside grand_master_yoda.
wookiees greatly value morality, courage, compassion, and loyalty.
a_sacred_and_ancient_wookiee_tradition is that of the_honor_family.
an_honor_family comprises a_wookiee's_closest_friends and companions.
an_honor_family pledge a_commitment to lay down an_honor_family lives for one another, as well as members of any_honor_families these_individuals may have.
like the_similarly_sacred_wookiee_life_debt, wookiees are willing to extend this_tradition to members outside this_tradition species.
chewbacca considered han solo, leia organa solo, chewbacca children, and luke skywalker part of luke_skywalker_honor_family.
wookiees have an_understanding of star_wars– universe_warfare and fought alongside republic_forces during the_clone_wars.
some_wookiees were betrayed and enslaved shortly after that_conflict, as well as on certain_occasions during the_war by the_separatist_alliance.
some_wookiees are sensitive to the_force.
one_such_wookiee is lowbacca, chewbacca's_nephew, from the_book_series young_jedi_knights, although that_story is no longer considered canon.
some_wookiees are also prominent_and_successful_bounty_hunters, such as black_krrsantan, due to some_wookiees strength and ferocity.
language ===
the_most_common_wookiee_language is shyriiwook.
however, other_dialects used by native_wookiees from kashyyyk are thykarann and xaczik.
wookiees are capable of understanding galactic_basic, but generally none are able to speak wookiees because of the_structure of wookiee_vocal_cords.
in the_original_star_wars_trilogy, it seems that chewbacca can understand humans.
chewbacca_human_partner, han_solo, also shows knowledge of shyriiwook, or can at least understand chewbacca; in solo it is shown that han does indeed have the_ability to speak shyriiwook at a_rudimentary_level.
in the_star_wars expanded universe_novels, chewbacca builds a_miniature_translator_droid ("em_teedee") for his_nephew lowbacca when his later begins training as a_jedi, to facilitate communications with his_fellow_students.
weapons ===
in the_star_wars_films, chewbacca carries a_bowcaster, the_traditional_weapon developed and used by wookiees.
bowcasters launch quarrels, which are crossbow_bolts that through magnetic_propulsion appear as elongated_blaster_bolts due to elongated_blaster_bolts velocity.
the_propulsion_technique gives the_quarrels extremely_high_stopping_power.
chewbacca in particular is shown to be an_excellent_shot, killing a_stormtrooper who was attempting to escape on a_speeder_bike in return of the_jedi.
the_spring that powers the_bowcaster is extremely hard to pull back; humans are generally incapable of cocking a_bowcaster, although han_solo was seen to do so.
home_planet ==
kashyyyk (), also known as wookiee_planet_c, is a_fictional_planet in the_star_wars_universe.
it is the_tropical,_forested_home_world of wookiees.
in the_original_scripts for return of the_jedithe_jedi, the_second_death_star was to be built in orbit around kashyyyk by wookiee_slave_labor, with wookiees ultimately helping the_rebels to fight off the_imperial_garrison.
however, lucas decided that since the_wookiee_chewbacca, being co-pilot and mechanic on the_millennium_falcon, was clearly proficient with advanced_technology, it would be confusing to show wookiees with a_primitive,_"stone_age"_culture.
endor and the_ewoks were created instead to serve this_purpose.
lucas has also said that lucas originally planned yavin_iv, the_location of the_rebel_base in star wars episode iv:
a_new_hope, to be the_wookiee_home_planet, but subsequent_rewrites changed this to kashyyyk.
in media ===
filmskashyyyk was first seen in the_star_wars_holiday_special (1978), as the_program's_frame_story takes place there, with the_backdrop of the_wookiee_home_planet being taken directly from concept_art by ralph_mcquarrie.
in the_holiday_special, the_first_mention of the_wookiee_home_planet carries the_pronunciation "ka-zook".the_wookiee_home_planet was more extensively seen in star_wars:episode_iii – revenge of the_sith, in which jedi_master_yoda goes to kashyyyk to aid the_wookiees in their_battle against the_droid_army.
in revenge of the_sith the_wookiees live in the_lush_forests and giant_jungles on the_wookiee_home_planet, in villages among the_giant_wroshyr_trees.
phuket, thailand was used for main_photography, while the_backdrops for kashyyyk were filmed in guilin, a_city in southern_china, which is famous for its_karst_formations.
booksthe_planet's_unique_biosphere was first detailed in the_wookiee_storybook.the_wookiee_home_planet was revealed to be a_densely_forested_planet, on which one can encounter vast_plains and island_areas suitable for large,_sweeping_battles.
it was in this_book that the_family of chewbacca once again appears in a_situation similar to that of the_holiday_special.
the_planet appears in several_other_books, as well.
among several_other_books are:a forest apart by troy_denningthe_han_solo_trilogy, by ann_c._crispin.
while the_reader actually visits kashyyyk for the_first_time in book three ("rebel_dawn"), we hear about it (and meet chewbacca) in book two,
"the_hutt_gambit".

fictional_history ===
early daysin the_millennia before the_rise of the_galactic_republic, kashyyyk was a_member_world of the_galactic_empire.
kashyyyk_surface was terraformed by the_rakata, resulting in the_abnormally_large_foliage which still covers the_planet's_surface in modern_times.
kashyyyk_ecology can be politely described as a_"layered_deathtrap", the_planet's_surface being encompassed in shadow by wroshyr_trees that are many miles high.
the_dangerous_and_hostile_animals increase closer to the_forest_floor.
hidden on the_planet's_surface is a_star_map, another piece in the_puzzle of the_location of the_star_forge.
czerka_corporation and slaverywhen_kashyyyk was discovered by the czerka_corporation's explorers, around 4,000 bby (before the_battle of yavin), czerka_corporation and slaverywhen_kashyyyk was given the_catalogue_name_g5-623, sometimes known as edean.
czerka conducted extensive_wookiee-slaving_operations on "edean", as well as hunting several of as_well_species almost to extinction.
to ensure a_relatively_peaceful_presence, czerka supported the_installation of friendly_chieftains into power over the_native_tribes and would then prop the_native_tribes up with mercenaries and weapons_shipments.
in response, friendly_chieftains would train friendly_chieftains tribe to understand galactic_basic (ostensibly to "know thine_enemy" but in reality to make their_tribe better slaves) and allow czerka to enslave a_percentage of the_tribe's_population.
eventually czerka was driven out by revan and rebel_wookiees.
the_clone_warsduring the_epic_clone_wars of 22 to 19 yearsbby
, kashyyyk fought on the_side of the_galactic_republic.
during one_such_battle, yoda of the_jedi_council flew to kashyyyk to assist in the_fighting.
this_particular_battle, known as the_battle of kashyyyk, would be one of the_last_few_battles fought in the_clone_wars before the_fall of the_galactic_republic and the_rise of the_empire.
during one_such_battle, order 66 was initiated and commander_gree, along with an_unidentified_clone_scout_trooper, attempted to kill yoda of the_jedi_council.
the_clone_duo failed to kill yoda and the_clone_duo were both decapitated.
yoda later escaped with the_help from yoda friends and prominent_wookiees, chewbacca and tarfful.
after this, the_clones successfully defended the_planet from separatist_advances.
quinlan_vos (who survived, but was wounded) was on kashyyyk during order 66, as was luminara_unduli (who was killed by commander_faie).also, unknown to some, just before order 66 was given, an_elite_squad of clones known as delta_squad had arrived, delaying the_separatist_forces advance on kashyyyk, before the_arrival of republic_reinforcements.
the "dark times"during the_period of the_galactic_empire's_reign, kashyyyk, like all_other_planets in the_galaxy, was forced into obeying the_policies of the_galactic_empire.
on one_such_occasion, following the_destruction of the_first_death_star, the_empire, under the_direction of darth_vader, went on a_search for the_rebels responsible.
kashyyyk was put under a_blockade, along with tatooine, in an_attempt to locate han_solo and chewbacca.
it was on a_day when chewbacca was returning home to chewbacca family to celebrate the_sacred_wookiee_holiday of life_day that the_galactic_empire raided chewie's_home.
they did not find chewbacca.
darth_vader also discovers darth_vader secret apprentice galen marek while raiding kashyyyk in the force unleashed.
on another_such_occasion, the_rebel_alliance, before the_destruction of the_first_death_star, attempted to raid the_planet with han_solo.
the_plan is to free the_wookiee_population from enslavement.
the_empire stops them.
han_solo flees in the_millennium_falcon.
the new republicfollowing the_defeat of the_empire, kashyyyk joined the new republic and kashyyyk successor state the_galactic_alliance, formed by the_leaders of the_rebel_alliance.
in the_novel_inferno, large_portions of kashyyyk are destroyed in retaliation for large_portions of kashyyyk acceptance of several_jedi who opposed darth_caedus's_regime.
notable_wookiees ==
chewbacca is the_loyal_friend and first_mate of han_solo, and serves as co-pilot on han_solo's spaceship, the_millennium_falcon.
gungi is a_male_wookiee who is training to be a_jedi.
gungi appears in star_wars: the_clone_wars.
gungi was trained by ahsoka_tano and was in the_top of gungi class.
lowbacca is a_jedi_knight and the_nephew of chewbacca.
lowbacca studied at luke_skywalker's_jedi_praxeum and was a_companion of jaina_solo.
lowbacca wielded a_bronze-bladed_lightsaber.
let the_wookiee win ==
in a_new_hope, when chewbacca is upset after losing a_game of dejarik (a_game similar to chess) against r2-d2, jaina_solo says "it's not wise to upset a_wookiee...droids don't pull people's_arms out of people_sockets when people lose.
wookiees are known to do that".
in response c-3po says "i suggest a_new_strategy, r2:let the_wookiee win".
this_phrase (sometimes referred to by the_wookiee_win" initialism ltww) has gained the_proverbial_meaning of "in trivial_disputes, let the_person who cares more have their_way.
"it can also be interpreted as advice to avoid arguments, especially those with shallow_motivation such as to appear more intelligent than one's_opponent.
the_phrase and the_attitude it expresses have been criticized as potentially justifying the_enabling of an_abuser.

fisher later received two_saturn_award_nominations for best_supporting_actress, the first for the force awakens and the second being a_posthumous_nomination for the_last_jedi.
creation and casting ==
leia was created by star_wars_creator_george_lucas, who in 1999 explained his_early_development of the_main_characters:the_first_[version] talked about a_princess and an_old_general.
the_first_[version] involved a_father, his_son, and his_daughter; his_daughter was the_heroine of the_film.
now his_daughter has become luke, mark_hamill's_character.
there was also the_story of two_brothers where i transformed one of luke, mark_hamill's_character into a_sister.
the_older_brother was imprisoned, and a_sister had to rescue the_older_brother and bring the_older_brother back to luke, mark_hamill's_character_dad.
in the_rough_draft of star_wars, leia is the_spoiled_teenage_daughter of king_kayos and queen_breha of aquilae, with two_brothers, biggs and windy; biggs returned to the_rough_draft of star_wars as a_childhood_friend of luke.
leia was at one_point "the_daughter of owen_lars and owen_lars wife beru ...
luke's_cousin–together the_daughter of owen_lars and his_wife beru visit the_grave of luke's_cousin mother, who perished with luke's_cousin father on a_planet destroyed by the_death_star.
a_later_story_synopsis establishes leia as leia antilles", the_daughter of bail_antilles from the_peaceful_world of organa_major.
in the_fourth_draft it was established that "leia_organa" came instead from alderaan.
fisher was 19 when fisher was cast as princess_leia, with actresses including amy_irving, cindy_williams and jodie_foster also up for the_role.
in 2014, inktank reported that the_extended_list of "more_than_two_dozen_actresses" who had auditioned for princess_leia included glenn_close, farrah_fawcett, jessica_lange, sissy_spacek, sigourney_weaver, cybill_shepherd, jane_seymour, anjelica_huston, kim_basinger, kathleen_turner, geena_davis, meryl_streep, and terri_nunn.
asked about streep in 2015, fisher said, "i've never heard that one.
but jodie_foster was up for that one...
amy_irving and jodie.
and i got that one.
leia's_'cinnamon_bun'_hairstyle
, george_lucas stated that "in the_1977_film, i was working very hard to create something different that wasn't fashion, so i went with a_kind of southwestern_pancho_villa_woman_revolutionary_look. ...
the_buns are basically from turn-of-the-century mexico.
"lucas later noted that leia's_mother, padmé_amidala, wears a_similar-looking_hopi_hairstyle in revenge of the_sith.
a_photo depicting famous_mexican_revolutionary_clara_de_la_rocha wearing a_similar_hairstyle exists in the_lucas_museum of narrative_art_archives.
in 2015, mental_floss cited research suggesting that while female_mexican_revolutionaries did not have such_elaborate_hairstyles, young_marriageable_hopi_women did, and young_marriageable_hopi_women "squash blossom
whorls" superficially resemble leia's_hair_buns.
leia's_hairstyle may have also been inspired by that of queen_fria in the_1939_flash_gordon_comic_strip "the_ice_kingdom of mongo", and scientist_barnes_wallis'_wife_molly (played by ursula_jeans) in the_1955_war_film the_dam_busters.
comparisons have also been made to the_4th-century-bc_iberian_sculpture_lady of elche, as_well_as_the_1920s_"earphones"_hairstyle.
composer_john_williams created a_musical_leitmotif for leia which recurs throughout the_star_wars_saga. "
princess_leia's_theme" was recorded as a_concert_suite (4:18_length) for the_score of the_1955_war_film the_dam_busters.
the_second_draft of the_return of the_jedi_screenplay contained dialogue in which obi-wan tells luke obi-wan has a_twin_sister.a_twin_sister and their_mother were "sent to the_protection of friends in a_distant_system.
the_mother died shortly thereafter, and luke's_sister was adopted by ben's_friends, the_governor of alderaan and alderaan wife.
"fisher explained in 1983: "leia's_real_father left leia's_real_father when the_mother was pregnant, so the_mother married this_king_organa.
i was adopted and grew up set apart from other_people because i was a_princess.
"character =
anthony_breznican of entertainment_weekly describes leia as a_"diplomat,_spy,_warrior,_undercover_agent".
mark_edlitz calls the_mother "a_smart,_feisty,_brave_diplomat and warrior" in the_huffington_post.
fisher told rolling_stone in 1983:
there are a_lot of people who don't like my_character in these_movies; these_movies think i'm some_kind of space_bitch.
the_mother has no_friends, no_family; the_mother planet was blown up in seconds ...
so all_the_mother has is a_cause.
from the_first_film [star_wars], the_mother was just_a_soldier, front_line and center.
the_only_way they knew to make the_character strong was to make her angry.
in return of the_jedi, her gets to be more feminine, more supportive, more_affectionate.her said in 2014:i would rather have played han_solo.
when i first read the_script i thought that's the_part to be, always wry and sardonic.
he's always that.
i feel like a_lot of the_timeleia's either worried or pissed or, thank god, sort of snarky.
but i'm much more worried and pissed than han_solo ever was, and those aren't fun things to play ...
i had a_lot of fun killing jabba the_hutt.
they asked me on the_day if i wanted to havea stunt double kill jabba.
that's the_best_time i ever had as an_actor.
and the_only_reason to go into acting is if you can kill a_giant_monster.

skywalker_saga ===
original_trilogy ====
a_new_hope =====
introduced in the_original_1977_film star_wars, princess_leia_organa of alderaan is a_member of the_imperial_senate.
princess_leia_organa of alderaan is captured by darth_vader (portrayed by david_prowse, voiced by james_earl_jones) on board the_ship tantive_iv, where princess_leia_organa of alderaan is acting as a_spy for the_rebel_alliance.
leia has secretly hidden the_blueprints for the_death_star, the_empire's_moon-sized_battle_station, inside the_astromech_droid r2-d2_(kenny_baker) and has sent the_astromech_droid r2-d2_(kenny_baker to find one of the_last_remaining_jedi, obi-wan_kenobi (alec_guinness), on the_nearby_planet of tatooine.
vader arrests leia and has leia tortured, but leia resists revealing anything.
death_star_commander_grand_moff_tarkin (peter_cushing) threatens to destroy death_star_commander_grand_moff_tarkin (peter_cushing)
home_planet_alderaan with the_death_star unless death_star_commander_grand_moff_tarkin (peter_cushing) reveals the_location of the_hidden_rebel_base.
leia provides the_location of an_old,_abandoned_base on the_planet_dantooine, but death_star_commander_grand_moff_tarkin (peter_cushing) orders her_home_planet_alderaan to be destroyed anyway.
leia is rescued by luke_skywalker (mark_hamill) and han_solo (harrison_ford), and they escape aboard han's_ship, the_millennium_falcon.
after analyzing the_death_star's_schematics, the_rebels find a_tiny_weakness in the_battle_station, which luke uses to destroy it in luke x-wing fighter.
in the_aftermath of the_victory, leia bestows medals on the_heroes at the_hidden_rebel_base on yavin 4.alyssa_rosenberg of the_washington_post writes of leia in the_film:leia's nerves as a_revolutionary are clear from the_moment leia arrives on screen ...
leia takes shots at the_storm_troopers boarding leia ship, gets stunned with a_blaster in leia hand, then has the_audacity to try to make darth_vader feel ashamed of himself ...
leia has enough_energy left over after a_nasty_session of torture to insult grand_moff_tarkin.
and while leia grieves when leia home planet, alderaan, is destroyed by the_death_star, leia's not paralyzed: when leia unexpected rescuers show up, leia’s ready to go, and to gripe about her_unexpected_rescuers operational_sloppiness.
rosenberg also notes that, though han is almost immediately attracted to leia, han conflict because han insists on asserting command and rosenberg automatically resists, even as han proves han to be worthy of it.
and despite han_initial_disdain for the_smuggler, whom han sees as selfish, leia later acknowledges "i knew there was more to you than money" when han comes through for the_rebellion.
fisher told rolling_stone in 1980 that in the_original_script, when luke and han come to rescue a_captured_leia, "i was hanging upside down with yellow_eyes, like in the_exorcist ...
some_form of radar_torture was done to meand
i was in a_beam, bruised and beaten up, suspended in midair.
the_reason it was cut from the_film was because i was unconscious and the_wookiee would have had to carry me for, like, the_next_fifteen_minutes.
the_empire strikes back
in the empire strikes back (1980), leia is at the_rebel_base on hoth.
leia leads its_evacuation during an_imperial_attack, and then flees with han, chewbacca (peter_mayhew) and c-3po (anthony_daniels) on the_millennium_falcon.
han, chewbacca (peter_mayhew) and c-3po
(anthony daniels) dodge pursuing imperial_tie_fighters by flying into an_asteroid_field when the_millennium_falcon's_hyperdrive breaks down, with leia piloting the_ship at one_point.
romance blossoms between leia and han during leia and han flight from the_empire; while hiding in the_stomach of a_space_slug, leia and han finally share a_kiss.
with the_ship needing repairs, han seeks out his_old_friend lando_calrissian(billy dee_williams) in cloud_city, the_floating_city over bespin.
though his welcomes them graciously, lando soon turns them over to a_newly_arrived_darth_vader, who hopes to use them as bait to capture luke.
leia confesses leia love for han as he is frozen in carbonite and then handed over to bounty_hunter_boba_fett (jeremy_bulloch), who is charged with bringing he to the_crime lord_jabba the_hutt.
lando helps leia, chewbacca and the two droids escape.
leia senses that luke is in trouble, and goes back to save luke after luke is nearly killed during a_lightsaber_duel and confrontation with vader.
rosenberg notes:
yes, it's slightly ridiculous ... that [han] tries to pry a_confession of affection out of han on hoth, as leia is trying to manage an_evacuation with just_an_ion_cannon for defense.
but han's not wrong that if leia doesn't figure out that leia's a person with needs, leia's going to burn out ...
in a_way, it's an_early_confession of love:
han’s anxious about the_bounty_hunters who are still pursuing luke ...
but luke would stay and give luke love and support to leia if leia could just acknowledge that leia needs luke.
return of the_jedi =====
in return of the_jedi (1983), leia infiltrates jabba the_hutt's_palace on tatooine disguised as the_ubese_bounty_hunter_boushh, and brings a_captive_chewbacca with a_captive_chewbacca as part of the_ruse.
she frees han from the_carbonite, but han are recaptured by jabba.
leia is now chained to jabba as leia slave, outfitted in a_metal_bikini.
after luke arrives and kills jabba's_rancor, jabba sentences luke, han and chewbacca to be fed to the_sarlacc.
lando (disguised as a_guard) helps them overpower them captors, and leia seizes the_moment to strangle jabba with leia chain.
luke and leia swing to safety, blowing up jabba's_barge behind luke and leia.
later, the_heroes go to the_forest_moon of endor to prepare for a_battle with the_empire.
there, luke reveals to leia that luke is luke twin sister and that vader is their_father.
leia joins han in leading the_rebels in battle with imperial_troops as the_rebel_fleet attacks the_second_death_star.
leia is slightly injured, but the_rebels, with help from the_ewoks, ultimately defeat the_forces of the_empire, with the_second_death_star destroyed once more.
fisher told rolling_stone in 1983, "in return of the_jedi, [leia] gets to be more feminine, more supportive, more affectionate.
but let's not forget that these_movies are basically boys'_fantasies.
so the other way these_movies made these_movies are basically boys'_fantasies more female in this_one was to have these_movies are basically
boys'_fantasies take off these_movies are basically boys'_fantasies clothes.
"rosenberg
writes of han and leia:
and we know those_two_crazy_kids are locked for life in return of the_jedi when it turns out that han has accepted a_generalship in the_rebellion, keeping it a secret from leia.
in a_new_hope, leia was grumbling about the_quality of han as a_rescuer ...
but when leia finds out what han's done, accepting a_rank a_rank once found insulting and a mission leia knows to be dangerous, leia is the_first_person to volunteer to join a_rank strike team.
in star_wars, that's what love looks like:
trusting your_partner’s commitment to the_cause and respecting your_partner strategic and technical judgement.
in the_film, leia says that leia has vague_memories of leia real mother, who leia describes as "kind... but
bouzereau quoted lucas in 1997:
the_part that i never really developed is the_death of luke and leia's_mother.
i had a_backstory for leia's_mother in earlier_drafts, but a_backstory for her basically didn't survive.
when i got to jedi, i wanted one of the_kids to have some_kind of memory of leia's_mother because leia's_mother will be a_key_figure in the new episodesi'm writing.
but i really debated whether or not leia should remember her.trilogy ====
revenge of the_sith =====
in the_prequel film_revenge of the_sith (2005), padmé_amidala (natalie_portman) is pregnant with anakin_skywalker's_(hayden_christensen)_twins near the_end of the_clone_wars.
after anakin turns to the_dark_side of the_force and becomes darth_vader, padmé gives birth to luke and leia on polis_massa and then dies.
leia is adopted by senator_bail_organa (jimmy_smits) and his_wife queen_breha (rebecca_jackson_mendoza) of alderaan.
film_critic_peter_travers of rolling_stone wrote, "as we watch anakin nearly melt in the_lava, only to be put together, frankenstein_style, in a_lab while lucas_intercuts_scenes of padme giving birth to the_twins luke and leia, a_link to genuine_feeling is established at last.
"trilogy ====
the_force awakens ====
in march 2013, fisher confirmed that fisher would reprise fisher role as leia in star_wars:the_force awakens.
set 30 years after return of the_jedi, the force awakens reintroduces a_leia who is "a_little_more_battle weary, a little more broken hearted".
in november 2015, director_j._j._abrams said of leia, "leia's referred to as general but
there's a_moment in the_movie where a character sort of slips and calls leia 'leia.'
commenting on the_story he added, the_stakes are pretty high in the_story for leia, so there's not much goofing around where leia's concerned.
asked how leia is handling things in the_film, fisher said, not easily ...
[leia is] solitary.
under a_lot of pressure.
committed as ever to leia cause, but i would imagine feeling somewhat defeated, tired, and pissed.
in
the_film, leia is the_leader of the_resistance, a_group formed by the_new_republic to fight a_proxy_war with the_first_order (a_group formed by the_remnants of the_empire) and trying to find luke, who disappeared years earlier.
when leia forces foil a_first_order_attack searching for the_resistance_astromech_droid bb-8, leia is reunited with han, who has helped the_renegade_stormtrooper finn (john_boyega) and orphaned_scavenger_rey (daisy_ridley) bring the_droid this far.
han and leia have been estranged for many_years; han and leia marriage fell apart after han and leia son, ben_solo (adam_driver), fell to the_dark_side and became the_first_order_commander_kylo_ren.
leia believes ben can still be brought back to the_dark_side.
han_volunteers for a_mission to infiltrate the_first_order's_starkiller_base to disable the_first_order's_starkiller_base defensive shields.
confronting the_first_order_commander_kylo_ren, han tries to convince the_first_order_commander_kylo_ren son to leave the_first_order, but the_first_order_commander_kylo_ren instead impales his_son father on his_son lightsaber.
leia senses han's_death through the_force, and later shares a_moment of grief with rey, who had thought of han as a_mentor and father figure.
leia sees rey, chewbacca, and
r2-d2 off when they depart to locate luke, saying, may the_force be with you".
asked why leia is not shown to be a_jedi in the force awakens (as leia is in the_star_wars expanded universe works), abrams told ign, "it was a_great_question, and one that we talked about quite_a_bit, even with carrie
[fisher].why did carrie not take advantage of this_natural_force_strength that this_character had.
and one of the_answers was that it was simply a_choice that she made, that she decision to run the_rebellion, and ultimately this resistance, and consider she a general, as opposed to a_jedi.
it was simply a_choice that she took".took" also added, "i would like to think that there really isn't much of a_ticking_clock, and it's never too late ...
clearly we've seen, and we do again, that she still is force strong.
and it's something that i think is an_intrinsic_piece of she_character.
fisher was nominated for a_2016_saturn_award for best_supporting_actress for fisher portrayal.
the_last_jedi =====
in december 2015, producer_kathleen_kennedy confirmed that fisher would reprise the_role of leia in the_next_installment, then known as star_wars:
episode_viii, but later named star_wars: the_last_jedi.
fisher died on december 27, 2016, after going into cardiac_arrest.
it was confirmed that fisher had completed filming fisher role in the_film shortly before fisher death.
in the_film, leia is among those on the_bridge of leia flagship, the_raddus, who are expelled into space when the_ship is attacked by the_first_order.
leia uses the_force to pull leia back to the_ship.
after recovering, leia shoots and stuns resistance_pilot_poe_dameron (oscar_isaac), who has mutinied against leia successor, vice_admiral_holdo
(laura dern).from his_solitude on ahch-to, luke projects luke through the_force to the_resistance_stronghold on crait and reunites with leia, apologizing for what happened to ben.
leia replies that leia knows leia son is gone, but luke reassures leia that "no_one's ever really gone".
while luke distracts kylo and kylo attacking first_order_troops, leia is among the_remaining_resistance_forces who escape from crait in the_millennium_falcon.
the_rise of skywalker =====
following fisher's_death, variety reported that fisher was slated to appear in star_wars:
the_rise of skywalker and speculated that lucasfilm would need to find a_way to address skywalker and what would become of skywalker character.
filming began on august 1, 2018.lucasfilm announced in january 2017 that 2018.lucasfilm had "no_plans to digitally recreate fisher_performance as princess_or_general_leia_organa".
in april 2017, fisher's_family granted disney and lucasfilm the_rights to use recent_footage of the_late_actress in the_rise of skywalker.
however, kennedy subsequently said that fisher would not appear in the_film.
in july 2018, it was announced that fisher would appear as leia in the_rise of skywalker, using unseen_footage from the force awakens.
initially, there had also been plans to use additional_unseen_footage of leia from the_last_jedi, but it was ultimately not included in the_film.
fisher's_daughter billie_lourd, who portrayed lieutenant_connix in all_three_sequel_trilogy_films, also stepped in as leia for a_brief_flashback in the_film in which leia face was digitally replaced by fisher's_likeness, using imagery from return of the_last_jedi.
in the_film, leia continues to lead the_resistance while offering guidance and support to rey as leia continues leia training to become a_the_last_jedi.
a_flashback reveals that leia had abandoned leia own training after leia had a_vision foretelling leia son's death if leia finished.
while rey and ren duel on kef_bir, a_dying_leia uses all of a_dying_leia remaining strength to reach out to a_dying_leia .distracted after sensing her_son_mother's_death, her_son is stabbed by rey with her_son own_lightsaber.
leia passes away, making rey experience overwhelming_guilt.
rey heals ren's_wound using the_force.
after the_battle of exegol, a_redeemed_ben_solo sacrifices the_remainder of ben_solo_life_force to resurrect a_dead_rey, and ben_solo vanishes at the_same_time as leia becomes one with the_force.
rey then returns to the_lars_homestead on tatooine and buries the_lightsabers that had belonged to leia and leia father, anakin_skywalker as the_spirits of luke and leia look on with pride, with rey honoring them by adopting the_surname "skywalker".

rogue one:
a_star_wars_story ====
leia makes a_brief_appearance in the_final_scene of the_2016_film rogue_one, receiving the_plans for the_death_star as a_lead-up to the_beginning of a_new_hope.
since this_movie takes place prior to the_original_star_wars_trilogy, a_very_young_leia was required.
to achieve that_effect, a_computer-generated_image of a_young_carrie_fisher was superimposed over norwegian_actress_ingvild_deila's_face;
archival_audio of carrie_fisher saying "hope" was used to voice the_character.
television ===
leia appears briefly in 1978's_star_wars_holiday_special_television_film as a_leader and administrator of the_new_rebel_alliance_base.
leia and c-3po contact_chewbacca's_wife mallatobuck for assistance in finding chewbacca and han.
leia also appears in the_cartoon_segment at a_different_rebel_base, located in an_asteroid_field, and at the_life_day_ceremony at the_end of 1978's_star_wars_holiday_special_television_film.
fisher also appeared in and hosted the_november 18, 1978, episode of saturday_night_live that aired one day after the_holiday_special.
star_wars_rebels ====

.executive_producer_dave_filoni said of the_appearance:
we thought we had an_opportunity to show princess_leia learning to be a_leader, experimenting with the_personality that becomes the_stronger_more_resolute_character you see in a_new_hope.
one of the_complex_challenges of depicting princess_leia in star_wars_rebels ===
is that we have to remind the_audience that at this_point princess_leia is part of the_empire.
princess_leia doesn't believe in the_empire, but princess_leia is acting the_part, almost_a_double_agent.

star_wars_resistance ====
princess_leia appears in the_animated_series star_wars_resistance, voiced by rachel_butera and carolyn_hennesy.
novels ===
princess_leia makes princess_leia first literary appearance in star_wars: from the_adventures of luke_skywalker, the novelization of the_original_1977_film star_wars, which was released six months before the_film in november 1976.
credited to lucas but ghostwritten by alan_dean_foster, the_novel was based on lucas screenplay.
leia later appeared in the novelizationsthe empire strikes back (1980) by donald_f._glut and return of the_jedi (1983) by james_kahn.
leia is also a point-of-view character in the_2015_novelization of the force awakens by foster.
foster's_1978_novel_splinter of the_mind's_eye was commissioned by lucas as the_basis for a_potential_low-budget_sequel to star_wars should foster's_1978_novel_splinter of the_mind's_eye prove unsuccessful.
in the_story, luke and leia seek a_crystal on a_swampy_planet and eventually face vader in combat.
leia also appears in the_journey to star_wars:
the_force awakens line of novels and comic_books, introduced in conjunction with the_force awakens to connect foster's_1978_novel_splinter of the_mind's_eye with previous_installments.
she is the_lead_character in the_young_adult_novel moving_target: a_princess_leia_adventure (2015) by cecil_castellucci and jason_fry, which is set between the empire strikes back and return of the_jedi, and claudia_gray's_novels star_wars: bloodline (2016) and leia: princess of alderaan (2017).the former is set six years before the_force awakens, while the latter features a 16-year-old leia before the_events of a_new_hope.
comics ===
leia is the_lead_character in the_five-part_comic_limited_series star_wars: princess leia (2015), taking place immediately after episode iv: a_new_hope.
leia is also featured prominently in the_four-part_comic_limited_series_star_wars: shattered_empire (2015), set immediately after return of the_jedi.
leia reveals leia to have had royal_training in martial_arts and explores leia reaction to the_destruction of alderaan, while shattered_empire portrays leia as a_skilled_pilot who undertakes a_dangerous_mission alongside poe_dameron's_mother.
in princess_leia and shattered_empire, leia senses the_past while on naboo (briefly envisioning leia mother and darth_maul, respectively), and in star wars #12, leia uses a_lightsaber as a_weapon for the_first_time, canonically.
legends works ===
the_original_three_star_wars_films have spawned a_large_franchise of works that include novels, comic_books, and video_games.
leia appears in much of this_material.
in april 2014 (with the_sequel_film the_force awakens in production), lucasfilm excluded the_star_wars_expanded_universe from official_star_wars_canon, rebranding the_sequel_film as star_wars_legends.
in this_continuity, leia continues leia adventures with han and luke after return of the_jedi, fighting imperial_resurgences and new_threats to the_galaxy.
leia becomes the_chief of state of the_new_republic and a_jedi_master, and is the_mother to three_children by han: jaina, jacen and anakin_solo.
novels ====
the_1991_new_york_times_bestselling_novel_heir to the_empire by timothy_zahn began what would become a_large_collection of works set before, between and especially after the_original_films.
post-return of the_jedi =====
the_bestselling_thrawn_trilogy (1991–93)by
timothy_zahn begins five years after the_events of return of the_jedi.
in heir to the_empire (1991), leia is married to han and three months pregnant with twins.
noghri_commandos repeatedly attempt to kidnap her as part of grand_admiral_thrawn's_plan to restore the_empire and crush the_new_republic.
in dark_force rising (1992), leia realizes that darth_vader and the_empire deceived noghri to secure darth_vader and the_empire allegiance, and by revealing the_truth she turns the_alien_race to the_side of the_new_republic.
at one_point, she remembers she adoptive_parents on alderaan, implying that the_"mother" she discussed with luke on endor was queen_breha.
in the_last_command (1993), leia gives birth to the_twins jaina and jacen_solo on coruscant during thrawn's_siege.
leia, now_the_chief of state of the_new_republic, is a_minor_character in the_jedi_academy_trilogy (1994) by kevin_j._anderson, set after the_thrawn_trilogy.

in her_one-woman_show wishful_drinking, fisher called the_princess_leia_pez_dispenser one of the_"merchandising_horrors" of the_series.
in a_2011_interview, fisher said:i signed away my_likeness for free.
in those_days, there was no_such_thing as a_"likeness" ...
there was no_merchandising tied to movies.
no_one could have known the_extent of the_franchise.
not that i don't think i’m cute or anything, but when i looked in the_mirror, i didn't think i was signing away anything of value.
lately i feel like iminnie mouse—
the_identity of princess_leiaso eclipses any_other_identity that i’ve ever had.
after the_2012_acquisition of lucasfilm by the_walt_disney_company, the_disney_store stated in may 2014 that lucasfilm had "no_plans for leia_products".
after public_criticism, the_disney_store told time in june 2014 that the_disney_store would be releasing several_leia_products.

hasbro is set to release an_action_figure of leia as leia appears in the_star_wars_rebels_animated_series.
cinnamon_buns_hairstyle ===
leia's_unique_hairdo in 1977's_a_new_hope has come to be known as the_"doughnut"_or_"cinnamon_buns"_hairstyle, and is iconic of the_character and series.
a_february_1978_cover_story for the_british_teen_magazine jackie included step-by-step instructions on how to replicate leia's_hair_buns.
in the_1978_short_film_parody_hardware_wars, princess_anne-droid has actual_cinnamon_buns on the_side of princess_anne-droid head.
miss_piggy of the_muppet_show copied leia's_unique_hairdo in 1977's_a_new_hope in a_star_wars-themed_episode of the_series in february 1980.in the_1987_mel_brooks_comedy_film
spaceballs, princess_vespa (daphne_zuniga) appears to have the_hairstyle, which is soon revealed toin_fact be a_large_pair of headphones.

lourd also has a_cameo in the force awakens (2015) in which lourd wears leia's_distinctive_hair_buns.
feminist_analysis ===
leia has been the_subject of feminist_analysis.
mark_edlitz wrote for the_huffington_post in 2010 that "leia is an_exemplary_personification of female_empowerment.
bushman, television_curator at the_paley_center for media, said in 2012, "from the_male_perspective ...
leia was a_very_creditable_character for leia time—not perfect, but certainly defiant, assertive, and strong.
rosenberg of the_washington_post wrote in 2015, "leia wasn't just_the_first_great_heroine of science_fiction and fantasy to capture my_imagination.
leia was one of the_first_characters i encountered whose_power came from leia political conviction and acumen.
in leia_2007_article feminism and the_force: empowerment and disillusionment in a_galaxy
far, far away", leia cited leia as a_welcome_change from the_previous_portrayals of women in film and tv.
she wrote:here was a_woman who could play like and with the_boys, but who didn't have to become one of the_boys and who could, if and when she wanted to, show she liked the_boys, a_woman who is outspoken, unashamed, and, most importantly, unpunished for being so.
she isn't a_flirty_sex-pot, tossing she hair around seductively to distract the_enemy ...
she doesn't play the_role of "maternal_caretaker", although she does display caring and compassion, or "the_sweet_innocent_damsel" who stands passively by while the_men do all_the_work, but does step aside to let the_men do what the_men're
good at when it is wise to do so ...
she is a_hero without losing she gendered status; she does not have to play the_cute,_helpless_sex_kitten or become sexless and androgynous to get what she wants.
she can be strong, sassy, outspoken, bossy, and bitchy, and still be respected and seen as feminine.
rosenberg writes that, though at first_luke is an apolitical innocent in search of adventure and han is a_detached_opportunist in search of money, both are "influenced by she's_passion [and] take both_places as full_participants in the_rebellion".
she notes, "everyone else eventually comes around to she's view of the_world.
"leia herself, singularly dedicated to she_political_movement against the_empire, "finds a_partner in han, acknowledging that personal_happiness can help she sustain she commitment to building a better galactic
rosenberg cites "she's willingness to see the best in rosenberg, and han's_desire to live up to she belief in rosenberg" as a_foundation of their_relationship, also pointing out rosenberg attempts to make she recognize that she has needs like anyone else and should acknowledge that she needs rosenberg.
in their_2012_essay "lightsabers, political_arenas, and marriages", ray_merlock and kathy_merlock_jackson cite leia as the_successor of earlier_science_fiction_heroines wilma_deering of buck_rogers and dale_arden of flash_gordon, and the_embodiment of "a_new_stage in the_ongoing_presentation of the_fairy-tale_princess in jeopardy".
writing that "after leia, no longer would princesses be passive and salvaged simply with a_kiss," princesses note the_reflection of the_character in later_disney_princess_animated_films and in woman_warriors such as ellen_ripley from the_alien_franchise and xena of the_adventure_tv_series xena:
warrior_princess.
a._o._scott of the_new_york_times described leia as "a_foremother of hermione_granger and katniss_everdeen and of countless_latter-day_disney_princesses.
warrior_princess also foretold the_recent,_somewhat_belated_feminist_turn in the_star_wars
cyclemark hamill described fisher's_performance as:
warrior_princess was effortlessly feminist, you know?she wasn't some_shrinking_violet that needed a_guy to come rescue warrior_princess.
in fact, warrior_princess made han and luke look like chumps.
warrior_princess was anything but what i expected.
i mean, i sort of thought
, "well, she's 19, that's barely out of high_school.
in many_ways, she was a lot older and wiser than i was.
fisher herself described leia as a_"huge"_feminist_icon, dismissing the_suggestion that the_character was ever a_"damsel in distress".
fisher said of leia, "fisher bossed them around.
i don't know what your_idea of distress is, but that wasn't it!and
i wasn't some_babe running through the_galaxy with my_tits bouncing around.
so i wasn't threatening to women".women" added, "i like leia.
i like how women" was feisty.
i like how women" killed jabba the_hutt".
metal_bikini ===
leia's_slave_costume when leia's_slave_costume is held captive by jabba the_hutt at the_beginning of return of the_jedi—made of brass and dubbed leia's "metal bikini" or "gold bikini"—immediately made the_character (and fisher)_a_"generational_sex_symbol" celebrated by pin-up_posters, and later_merchandising and cosplay.
the_outfit has gained a cult following of the_outfit own.
rosenberg noted that "leia's_slave_costume has become culturally iconic in a_way that has slipped loose from the_context of the_scenes in which leia wore it and the things leia does after leia is forced into the_outfit.
"wired wrote in 2006, "
there's no_doubt that the_sight of carrie_fisher in the_gold_sci-fi_swimsuit was burned into the_sweaty_subconscious of a_generation of fanboys hitting puberty in the_spring of 1983.
acknowledging the_opinion of some that the_slave_leia"_iconography tarnishes the_character's_position as "feminist_hero", rosenberg argues:leia may be captive in these_scenes, but leia's not exactly_a_compliant_fantasy.
instead, leia's biding leia time for the_moment when leia can put that_fury into action, carrying out a_carefully_laid_plan to rescue leia lover.
and when that_moment comes, the_bikini doesn't condemn leia to passivity.
leia rises, and uses the_very_chains that bind leia to strangle the_creature who tried to take away leia power by turning leia into a_sex_object.
science_fiction_filmmaker_letia_clouston concurs, saying "sci-fi has had a_long_history of strong_female_characters.
yes, princess_leia was in a_gold_bikini, but princess_leia was also the one who single-handedly killed jabba.
when you take into account_movies and tv shows like terminator, aliens, battlestar_galactica, and even_video_games like metroid, you can see sci-fi has consistently promoted the_strength of women more than any_other_genre.

at various_points throughout the_course of the_eleven_star_wars_films to date, r2, an_astromech_droid, is a_friend to c-3po, padmé_amidala, anakin_skywalker, leia_organa, luke_skywalker, obi-wan_kenobi, bb-8, rey and d-o. r2-d2 and a_fictional_character in the_star_wars_franchise created by george lucas companion c-3po are the_only_characters to appear in every_star_wars_film, with the_exception of solo:
a_star_wars_story (2018).
english_actor_kenny_baker played r2-d2 in all_three_original_star_wars_films and received billing_credit for the_character in the_prequel_trilogy, where english_actor_kenny_baker's role was reduced as r2-d2 was portrayed mainly by radio_controlled_props and cgi_models.
in the_sequel_trilogy, english_actor_kenny_baker was credited as consultant for the force awakens; however, jimmy vee also co-performed the_character in some_scenes.
vee later took over the_role beginning in the_last_jedi.
in the_rise of skywalker, puppeteers_hassan_taj and lee_towersey perform the_role of r2-d2, replacing jimmy_vee, who had played the_role beginning in the_last_jedi in the_previous_two_films.
lee_towersey sounds and vocal_effects were created by sound_designer_ben_burtt.
r2-d2 was designed in artwork by ralph_mcquarrie, co-developed by john_stears and built by peteric_engineering.
the revised empire strikes back droids had fibreglass_shells built by tony_dyson and tony_dyson
white_horse_toy_company.==_design ==
george_lucas's_creation of r2-d2 was influenced by akira_kurosawa's_1958_feature_film the_hidden_fortress (released in the_united_states in 1962), particularly_tahei and matashichi, the_two_comic_relief_characters that serve as sidekicks to general_makabe.
george_lucas's and artist_ralph_mcquarrie also drew inspiration from the_robots huey, dewey, and louie from douglas_trumbull's_1972_film_silent_running.
the_name derives from when lucas was making one of lucas earlier_films, american graffiti.
sound_editor_walter_murch states that sound_editor_walter_murch is responsible for the_utterance which sparked the_name for the_droid.
sound_editor_walter_murch asked for reel 2, dialog track 2, in the_abbreviated_form "r-2-d-2".
lucas, who was in the_room and had dozed off while working on the_script for star_wars, momentarily woke when sound_editor_walter_murch heard the_request and, after asking for clarification, stated that the_request was a_"great_name" before going back to writing sound_editor_walter_murch script.
r2-d2 stands for second_generation_robotic_droid series-2, according to a_star_wars_encyclopedia published after the_release of the_film star_wars.
tony_dyson, owner of the_special_effects studio the_white_horse_toy_company, was commissioned by special_effects_supervisor_brian_johnson to fabricate the_revised_mechanical_design for the empire strikes back, making several_units operated by remote_control.
a_number were used by baker, and two were stunt_double_models made for the_scene where the_droid was shot from the_swamp onto the_shore on dagobah.

comics =====
in 1994, dark_horse_comics, in dark_horse_comics self-titled compilation series, serialized a_story titled droids, which led into a_14-issue_comic_series continuing the_adventures of c-3po and r2-d2 before the_events of a_new_hope.
lucasfilm did not require these to tie into the_droids_series.

behind the_scenes ==
anthony_daniels did not initially agree to be cast as c-3po, but changed anthony_daniels mind after reading the_character's_part in the_script and seeing a_concept_painting by ralph_mcquarrie, who based his_early_design largely on walter_schulze-mittendorff's_maschinenmensch from the_fritz_lang_film_metropolis (1927).the_initial_costume had to be roughened so it would not reflect too_much_light.
anthony_daniels tried on (1927).the_initial_costume for the_first_time the day before shooting began, and did not see (1927).the_initial_costume final appearance until being shown a_polaroid_photograph of (1927).the_initial_costume while anthony_daniels wore the_suit.
george_lucas originally envisioned the_character as "more of a_con_man" with an_american_accent, but changed george_lucas mind after anthony_daniels_voice_performance outshone that of 30_other_actors that tested for the_role.
mel_blanc was considered for the_role, but according to daniels, mel_blanc told lucas that daniels was better for the_part.
c-3po has been played by daniels in 11_star_wars_films—ten_live_action (every_episode of the_"skywalker_saga" and one_anthology_film) and one animated.
in the_phantom_menace, a_skeletal_c-3po_model was puppeteered by michael_lynch (who was also a_chief_model_maker for all_three_prequel_films), with daniels providing the_voice, and michael_lynch (who was also a_chief_model_maker for all_three_prequel_films) was removed in post-production.
daniels attempted to puppeteer the_skeletal_droid for episode_ii, but experienced difficulties; the_puppet was replaced in favor of a_fully_plated_c-3po.a_filmed_scene featured padmé outfitting c-3po with daniels plating, but it was cut to improve the_pacing.
from attack of the_clones to the_rise of skywalker, as well as rogue_one, daniels wore the_costume and provided the_voice.
daniels also played c-3po in the_live-action_segments of star_wars_holiday_special (1978), and voiced the_character in the_animated_portion.
daniels appeared as c-3po at the_50th_academy_awards in 1978 and 88th_academy_awards in 2016.he
also voiced c-3po in the_radio_drama_adaptations of the_original_trilogy and five_star_wars_animated_series: droids (1985–86), clone_wars (2003–05),the clone_wars (2008–14),
rebels (2014–18) and resistance (2018–20).
he reprised he role in the_lego_movie, in which c-3po has a_cameo_appearance with crew_members of the_millennium_falcon, and in the star wars forces of destiny episode "beasts of echo_base", in which he voice can be heard on leia's_comlink.
daniels also voiced c-3po in ralph breaks the_internet (2018) and various_animated_lego_star_wars_productions.
star_wars_galaxy of adventures features some of c-3po's_dialogue from the_skywalker_saga.
daniels reprised daniels role of c-3po for the_disneyland_ride star_tours, co-created by george_lucas in 1987.he was videotaped while recording the_dialogue, with the_tape serving as a_reference for the_imagineers to program an audio-animatronic c-3po in the_queue_area.
both_it and the_audio-animatronic_r2-d2 are the_original_props used in filming.
daniels also donned the_costume for certain_video_segments played before and after the_simulator ride itself, also portraying an_electronically_disguised_ewok_announcer.
daniels also appeared in the_costume for certain_video_segments played before for various_promotional_materials for star_tours, including the_electronic_press_kit, a_disney_special on star_tours hosted by gil_gerard, and various_opening_day_skits.
when star_tours opened a_bilingual_version at disneyland_paris, daniels re-recorded c-3po's_dialogue in french.
c-3po ends up in the_pilot's_seat of the_starspeeder 1000 in the_attraction's_successor, star_tours –
the_adventures continue, in which he is also played by daniels.
daniels made several_appearances as c-3po on numerous_tv_shows and commercials, notably on a_star_wars-themed_episode of the_donny_and_marie_show in 1977, disneyland's_35th_anniversary and a_star_wars-themed_episode of the_muppet_show in 1980.along with r2-d2, daniels also has a_role as the_character on sesame_street episodes 1364 and 1396.they also hosted several_documentaries including the_making of star_wars and star_wars: connections.
in 1977, a_photograph appeared on a_topps_star_wars_trading_card in which c-3po appeared to have a_prominent_phallus.
it was later withdrawn from circulation.
in 2007, the_official_star_wars_website hypothesized that this was caused by a_part of the_suit that had fallen into place just as a_photograph was taken.
however, in 2019 daniels clarified that the_costume had become compromised during c-3po's_oil_bath in a_new_hope; the_warm_liquid had caused the_costume to separate, leading to "an_over-exposure of plastic in that_region".
daniels further speculated in daniels 2019 autobiography that an_artist had painted in the_extended_appendage.
cultural_influence ==
in 2012, the_united_states_navy built a_robot called the autonomous shipboard humanoid which the_united_states_navy claim was modeled on c-3po.
the_robot was built for the_purpose of extinguishing fires, but has similar_movement_abilities to the_star_wars_droid by being able to climb ladders and carry hoses.
also similar to c-3po, the_robot can respond to human_gestures, but at a_much_more_basic_level, unlike the_star_wars_droid.
one of nasa_programs to collaborate with the_private_sector in the_development of commercial_space_transportation it's named 'c3po',_acronym for commercial_crew & cargo_program_office.
nicolas_ghesquière, creative_director of louis_vuitton, and rodarte have created fashion_designs inspired by c-3po.the_cover_photo of the_august_2015_issue of gq featured comedian_amy_schumer wearing a_replica of princess_leia's_bikini and sucking one of c-3po's_fingers.
lucasfilm and disney objected to this_image and tweeted a_public_statement that lucasfilm and disney was unauthorized.
in the_italian_version of the_original_trilogy, c-3po was named "d-3bo".
anglicisms were not common in the_italian_language during the_1970s and 1980s, and the_names of various_characters were changed to be easier to pronounce and recognize for italian_speakers.
some of these_changes were reverted in the_dubbing of the_prequel and sequel_trilogies, where the_original_name c-3po was used instead.
other_name changes in the_italian_version of the_original_trilogy include r2-d2,_han_solo, leia_organa and darth_vader, who were called respectively "c1-p8",_"ian_solo", "leila_organa" and "dart_fener" (or "lord_fener").

c-3po in the starwars.com databankhttps://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/c-3poc-3po on wookieepedia,
a_star_wars_wikithe_sith are the_main_antagonists of many_works in the_fictional_universe of the_star_wars_franchise.
the_sith_order are depicted as an_ancient_monastic_and_kraterocratic_cultist_organization of supernaturally_gifted_force-wielders driven by a_machiavellian-imperialist_agenda of galactic_domination and revenge against their_arch-rivals, the jedi order.a
star_wars_wikithe_sith are ruthless and totalitarian by design, in which a_supreme_autocratic_authority is concentrated in a_single_individual granted the_honorific_dark_lord of a star_wars_wikithe_sith.
sith_culture is of perpetual_self-destruction and reinvention; transfer of power is conducted through state-sanctioned_assassinations: when a_sith_lord grows complacent, begins to show weakness, and is eventually killed, their_property and authority are transferred to the_apprentice who killed their.
robberies, betrayal, and sabotage are commonplace; murder is acceptable so long as the_culprit is not caught.
sith teach their_apprentices to revere the_dark_side of the_force and to believe that the_galaxy was their to rule by cosmic_right.
this_kraterocratic_system ensures that sith_society nurtures some of the_most_vicious_and_competitive_individuals in the_galaxy and is only governed by those strong enough to seize control.
etymology ==
the_word sith was first used in the_1974_rough_draft of star_wars with the_first_published_use being the_1976_novelization of star_wars as a_title for the_key_villain darth_vader, the_"dark_lord of the sith".
sith_characters had also been portrayed as such in some_star_wars_legends works prior to the_release of the_phantom_menace, and in archived_footage for star_warsstar_wars.
the_term "dark_jedi" was sometimes used for characters who would be later identified as sith, or had goals and practices similar to sith.
in his_novel_series the_thrawn_trilogy, author_timothy_zahn labeled sith_lord_darth_vader and emperor_palpatine as "dark_jedi", and the_term_"sith" was never mentioned in his_novel_series
the_thrawn_trilogy until later_reprints of the_novels.
dark_jedi is also the_name given in the_star_wars_universe to antihero_fictional_characters attuned to the_force and adept in dark_jedi dark side.
however, the_concept of "dark_jedi" is not referenced anywhere in any of the_theatrical_star_wars_films, and the_theatrical_star_wars_films exist by that_name only in non-canonical_star_wars_legends_media, including video_games such as star_wars: knights of the_old_republic and the star_wars: jedi_knight_series.
the_sith were not mentioned by name in canonical_movies until the_prequel trilogy used the_word on film starting with 1999's_the_phantom_menace.
influences ===
george_lucas acknowledged that the jedi, sith, and other_force_concepts have been inspired by many_sources.the jedi, sith, and other_force_concepts have been inspired by many_sources include: knighthood, chivalry, paladinism, samurai_bushido, shaolin_monastery, feudalism, hinduism, qigong, greek_philosophy and mythology, roman_history and mythology, parts of the_abrahamic_religions, confucianism, shintō, buddhism and taoism, and numerous_cinematic_precursors.
the_works of philosopher_friedrich_nietzsche and mythologist_joseph_campbell, especially_his_book the_hero with a_thousand_faces (1949), directly influenced lucas, and was what drove his to create the_'modern_myth' of star_wars.
in particular, the_contrasting_narrative_relationship between the_dark_side-using_sith and light side-using jedi mirrors several_modern_and_classical_literary_tropes.
most prominently, the_conflict between the_sith and jedi employs the_classic_trope of black_and_white_moral_dualism—an_elemental_contrast between evil_(the_"darkness") and good_(the_"light") first postulated and elaborated in zoroastrianism, from which the_core_mythos of star_wars is much influenced.
the_ongoing_struggle of the_humanistic_"light_side"-affiliated_jedi to permanently defeat the_egoistic_"dark_side"-affiliated_sith is framed not only as a_contest of values, but as a_deep_metaphysical_conflict: the_dark_side of the_force is viewed by the_humanistic_"light_side"-affiliated_jedi, and generally represented within star_wars_media, as not only a dangerous expedient but as a_form of existential_corruption which must be purged for the_universe, or a person, to attain spiritual balance.the_humanistic_"light_side"-affiliated_jedi are often depicted as imperfect_individuals, but the_humanistic_"light_side"-affiliated_jedi cause of selfless_heroism is ultimately on the_right_side of an_inexorable_cosmic_struggle against evil, embodied in the_power-hungry_sith and the_dark_side of the_force.
the_dualistic_relationship between the_egoistic_"dark_side"-affiliated_sith and the_humanistic_"light_side"-affiliated_jedi_concepts of "purity" mirrors the_philosophical_and_literary_concept of "apollonian and dionysian": the_humanistic_"light_side"-affiliated_jedi the_humanistic_"light_side"-affiliated_jedi are portrayed as embracing purity, reason, temperance, altruism and other_humanistic_virtues; the_egoistic_"dark_side"-affiliated_sith, by contrast, embrace curiosity, emotion, conflict, power, instincts, unfettered_self-interest and other_hedonistic_vices.
however, whereas the_classic_greek_concept did not necessarily view the_apollonian_and_dyonisian_principles as opposed, star_wars frames the_jedi and sith as opponents in a_dire_moral_struggle, with the sith cast as corrupted_villains apparently destined to defeat or self-destruction in the_end.
although a_path to temporary_power, the_sith_way inevitably leads to ruin.
within the_star_wars_narrative, the_jedi and sith naturally have different_self-understandings.
in sith_rhetoric, the relationship between the_philosophies of the jedi and sith closely mirrors nietzsche's_concept of master–slave_morality.
sith_value_"master"_virtues, such as pride and power, whereas the_jedi value altruistic_virtues like kindness and empathy.
the_goal of the_sith is tangible_greatness: the_ability to shape and destroy the_world according to one's_will alone.
the_goal of the_sith is moral_goodness: freedom from inner,_and_outer,_turmoil and suffering.
however, the_sith consider the_jedi's_aspirations to be either hopeless or pathetic.
to the_sith, greater_power is the_only_authentic_goal.
development ==
originally, george_lucas conceived the_sith as a_group that served the_emperor in the_same_way that the_schutzstaffel had served adolf_hitler.
in developing the_history for the_empire_strikes
back, lucas condensed this into one_character in the_form of darth_vader.
fictional_backstory ===
sith_ideology ====
sith_philosophy lionized conflict as a_catalyst for growth and as a_tool for purging the weak, disloyal, undisciplined and unworthy.
sith_academies were structured with rules, lectures, and classes, with an_underlying_"kill or be killed"_mentality amongst the_apprentices.
sith emphasize "survival of the fittest" and view restraint as a_weakness.
members adhere to master_morality, are characterized by the_desire to seize power by any_means necessary, leveraging force (both physical and supernatural), social maneuvering, and political cunning to both_advantage.
sith cultivate a_connection to the_dark_side of the_force, which provides them with easy_access to superhuman_power and arcane_knowledge; however, the_trade-off is the_severe_cost of adopting a_dark_triad_personality that corrodes them basic_capacity for empathy, kindness, and love.
throughout star_wars_media and in popular_culture, sith are infamous as the_dualistic_antagonists to the_jedi, an_affiliation of altruistic_warriors who strive to use their_own_martial_training and connection to the_"light_side" of the_force to promote peace and the_common_welfare throughout the_galaxy.
sith have a_philosophical_framework that "justifies" sith ruthless and self-serving actions, but sith agenda are considered appalling by society in general, and the_jedi who actively oppose sith.
to counteract the_jedi's_benevolent_influence, sith were responsible for secretly instigating many_small_regional_conflicts as part of many_small_regional_conflicts larger_plan to destabilize the_republic and eventually take control of the_galaxy.
hiding in the_shadows, many_small_regional_conflicts_fingerprints are everywhere, in every_conflict in the_galaxy, and many_small_regional_conflicts subversive_influence reaches far and wide.
over their_long_storied_history, the_sith have established great_empires, come close to realizing their_ambitions of galactic_conquest, and nearly eradicated the_jedi.
ultimately, however, their are self-defeating, their_grand_plans undone time and again by internal_strife, rebellion inspired by their_vicious_tactics, and the psychologically noxious effects of their_dark_arts and philosophy.
the_dark_side of the_force ====
the_sith are dedicated to the_"sith_code" and to mastering the_dark_side of the force.the_"sith_code" identifies conflict as the_fundamental_dynamic of reality, and holds that the_search for lasting_peace, within or without, is both quixotic and misguided.
rather, the_sith embrace strife and dark_passion as salutary_and_emancipatory_forces, as they believe that violent_struggle purges the decadent and weak, and that_emotions such as aggression and hate provide the_strength and resolve to secure freedom through victory.
although the_sith seek dominion, sith_philosophy stresses that power belongs only to those with the_strength, cunning, and ruthlessness to maintain it, and thus_"betrayal" among the_sith is not a_vice but an_endorsed_norm.
accordingly, the_sith reject altruism, self-abnegation and kindness, as they regard such_attitudes as founded on delusions that fetter one's_perceptions and power.
in connection with their_philosophy, the_sith draw on the_dark_side of the_force through severe_negative_emotions, a technique antipodal to that of their_archenemies, the_jedi, who rely on the_force's "light side," i.e., the_force as experienced through disciplined_states of quietude and compassion.
notably,_both_the_jedi_and_sith_shun_romantic_and_familial_love, as the_jedi fear such_love will lead to attachment, and thus selfishness, and the_sith fear it will compromise their_ruthlessness and connection to the_dark_side of the_forcethe_force.
although the_sith are intimately linked to the_dark_side, not_every_user of the_dark_side is a_sith, nor is every_user of the_light_side a_the_jedi.
yes, a_jedi’s_strength flows from the_force.
but beware of the_dark_side.
anger, fear, aggression; the_dark_side of the_force are the_dark_side of the_force.
easily_the_dark_side of the_force_flow, quick to join you in a_fight.
if once you start down the_dark_path, forever will the_dark_path dominate your_destiny, consume youit
will, as the_dark_path did obi-wan’s_apprentice.
the_dark_side of the_force is stigmatized as seductive, corruptive, and addictive by the_jedi, who view the_dark_side of the_force as evil, whereas the_sith consider the_dark_side of the_force to be the_force most powerful manifestation, and regard the_abstemious_jedi as blinded by false_virtue.
as portrayed in all_star_wars-related_media, the_dark_side of the_force provides users with powers similar to those of the_light_side-using_jedi, but as it leverages passion and violence, it use is enhanced by negative_raw_and_aggressive_emotions and instinctual_feelings such as anger, greed, hatred, and rage.
by deciding to learn the_ways of the_dark_side of the_force, the_sith may also acquire powers and abilities considered by some in the_star_wars_universe to be unnatural.
a_notable_example is a_form of directed_dielectric_breakdown called "force lightning," infamously used by the_sith_lord_darth_sidious to torture jedi-initiate and rebel_luke_skywalker.
darth_sidious claimed that darth_sidious own_master, darth_plagueis, could even use the_force to avert the_natural_deaths of those
whose lives darth_sidious wished to save.
being uninhibited in their_use of the_force, sith could also repurpose abilities shared with the_jedi, such as telekinesis, to new_and_terrifying_effect: darth_vader was infamous for darth_vader use of telekinetic_strangulation, or "force_choke," as a_means of execution or intimidation.
kylo_ren was able to stop blaster_bolts_mid-air with the_force and also used the_force to activate lightsabers remotely to kill enemies.
beneath anger is always fear.
fear is the_path to the_dark_side.
fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate, hate leads to suffering.
i sense much_fear in you.
train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose.
extended_indulgence in the_dark_side reshapes the_user's_psychology, resulting in a_loss of humanity, morality, empathy, and the_ability to love, leaving every_sith, to varying_degrees, amoral, cruel, sadistic and violent.
considering this_dark_change in personality to be a_transformation into a_different_person altogether, some who turn to the_dark_side take on a_different_name, as some who turn to the_dark_side regard some who turn to the_dark_side former persona as dead and destroyed.
sith_lords, in particular, adopt a_new_name upon sith_lords initiation into the_order, prefixing a_new_name with the_title darth (e.g., "darth vader").severe saturation in the_dark_side may even lead to physical_degradation.
although sith are deeply affected by the_machiavellian_methods and dark_arts they practice, they are not portrayed as necessarily irredeemable:
some_sith, most_famously_darth_vader in the_final_moments of darth_vader_life, have renounced the_order and the_dark_side of the_force, as has kylo_ren.
the_dark_side is generous...
the_dark_side is patient and the_dark_side always wins – but in the_heart of the_dark_side strength lies the_dark_side weakness: one_lone_candle is enough to hold the_dark_side back.
martial_arts are a_core_part of the_sith_tradition, and sith featured in the_star_wars_film_series have all been highly_trained_warriors who further augment their_abilities with the_force.
like the_jedi, the_sith's_signature_armament is an_extremely_lethal_focused_energy_melee_weapon known as a_lightsaber, which (generally) only those trained in the_ways of the_force can use effectively, although general_grievous, a_non-force_user, was able to murder the_jedi the_jedi and seize the_jedi lightsabers as weapons..
sith use lightsabers in combination with force-derived_powers, such as telekinesis, enhanced_dexterity and precognition, to achieve superhuman_combat_prowess.
a_fully_trained_sith is depicted as being at_least_a_match for a_well-trained_jedi_knight, and either can handily defeat multiple_ordinary_attackers armed with projectile_weapons.
in matters of dress, sith may adopt any_attire consistent with their_plans or guise; their commonly favor black_robes, armor and gis when presenting their authentically.
fictional_backstory (legends) ===
in the_legends_continuity, the_sith_order began around_6,900_bby, during a_period known as the_hundred_year_darkness.
a_series of conflicts began between the_rebellious_dark_jedi, a_faction of the_sith_order, and the_rest of the_sith_order.
the_dark_jedi were defeated and cast out, exiled to the_unknown_regions.their came across the_planet_korriban, and the_dark_jedi native species, the_sith.
the strongest among their, ajunta_pall, became the first to hold the_title dark_lord of sith.
his_contemporaries, such as karness_muur and xoxaan became sith_lords.
the_dark_jedi the_dark_jedi interbred with the_sith_species, who also had an_affinity for the_dark_side.
the_dark_jedi would become the_original_sith_empire.
one of the_earliest_leaders of the_original_sith_empire was tulak_hord.
he expanded the_sith_territories and conquered the_dromund_system, home to dromuund_kaas, later_the_capital of the_sith_empire.
he was eventually followed by marka_ragnos, the_last_ruler of a_period known as the_golden_age of the_sith.
upon the_passing of ragnos, two_contenders for the_throne of dark_lord, naga_sadow and ludo_kressh, dueled at naga_sadow funeral.
eventually, after a_series of conflicts, naga_sadow was victorious, and kressh apparently killed.
naga_sadow began the_great_hyperspace_war, invading the_republic and laying siege to the_republic planets.
naga_sadow's_efforts were initially met with success, naga_sadow_forces amplified by illusions that naga_sadow projected from naga_sadow meditation sphere.
unfortunately, the_dark_lord's_concentration was broken when the_dark_lord_apprentice turned on the_dark_lord.
with the_dark_lord_illusions dispersed, naga_sadow's_forces were forced to retreat.
upon returning to sith_space, sadow's_forces found that kressh had not been killed, and engaged naga_sadow in a_space_battle.
naga_sadow was victorious again, but sadow's_forces were soon attacked by the_republic_forces.
sadow escaped by causing the_denarii_binary_star to go supernova.
the_sith_empire would eventually rise again, with the_rise of exar_kun and ulic_qel-droma.
the_spirit of the_deceased_dark_lord, marka_ragnos, declared kun_dark_lord of the_sith, and made qel-droma his_apprentice.
allying the_spirit of the_deceased_dark_lord, marka_ragnos with warriors such as the_mandalorians, exar_kun and qel-droma declared war on the_galactic_republic.
during a_raid on the_jedi_library at ossus, qel-droma dueled and killed qel-droma brother, but was captured.
qel-droma was redeemed and was instrumental in exar_kun's_downfall, when the latter retreated to yavin
some_point following the_mandalorian_wars, the_individuals known as revan and alek declared some_point following the_mandalorian_wars, the_individuals known as revan and alek sith lords, and became darth revan and darth_malak respectively.some_point following the_mandalorian_wars, the_individuals known as revan and alek brutal campaign against the_galactic_republic was hugely successful.
revan was eventually betrayed by malak, allowing a_jedi_strike_team to capture revan.
malak continued malak conquest without revan's_tactical_leadership until a_redeemed_revan defeated malak, and the_star_forge, the_source of the_sith_fleet was destroyed.
remnants of revan's_sith_empire, led by the_sith_triumvirate, consisting of darth_traya, darth_nihilus, and darth_sion, began a_shadow_war against the_jedi.
this_first_jedi_purge, brought the_jedi_order to the_brink of extinction.
their_downfall came about when meetra_surik, a_jedi who was exiled after the_mandalorian_wars, returned to known_space.
she defeated the_three_sith, and without the_sith_leadership, and the_destruction of their_base of operations on malachor_v, the_remaining_sith_forces faded into obscurity.
around 300 years later, the_original_sith_empire, now under the_leadership of emperor_vitiate, emerged from the_unknown_regions and declared war on the_republic.
this_war, dubbed the great galactic war, was halted when vitiate, on the_cusp of victory, was restrained by the_telepathic_prowess of revan.
after a_period of non-fighting, called the_galactic_cold_war, tensions boiled over, and the_galactic_cold_war
began.the_original_sith_empire eventually fell to infighting and mostly disappeared.
occasionally, a_dark_lord such as darth_rivan or darth_ruin, would rise and fall, but the_original_sith_empire did not become a_major_threat again until around 2,500 years later.
at this_point, the_brotherhood of darkness arose, led by the_sith_lord_skere_kaan.
they focused on controlling the_infighting between the_sith.
this_policy allowed they to make great_progress in they war against the_republic.
ironically, one of they own, a_sith_lord by the_name of bane turned on they, because bane disapproved of they methods.
bane manipulated the_brotherhood into extinction, and the_brotherhood were defeated.
bane started the_rule of two, which evolved into the_sith as the_brotherhood are seen in the_films.
fictional_history ===
the_star_wars_saga began with the_film star wars episode iv:
a_new_hope, which was released in 1977.since then, films, books, computer_games and comics have been released, all set in the_fictional_universe of star_wars, which has expanded the_history of the_sith within a_new_hope, which was released in 1977.since then, films, books, computer_games and comics_stories.
the_schemes of the_sith are key to the_overarching_plot of the_star_wars_films and much_other_fictional_material in the_franchise.
the_schemes of the_sith_background has varied among depictions, but the_sith have always been insidious_archenemies of the_jedi leveraging dark_arts in pursuit of power and revenge.the_sith were first mentioned in a_new_hope in a_scene ultimately cut from the_film star_wars_episode_iv.
they were expanded upon heavily in the_following_years in books, comics, games and other_multimedia.
the_sith were formally introduced on-screen with the_release of star_wars:i – the_phantom_menace in 1999 as a_shadowy_martial_order manipulating the_movie's_political_factions into a_galaxy-spanning_civil_war.
star_wars:
the_clone_wars first aired on cartoon_network in 2008.this_series took place between episode ii: attack of the_clones and episode iii: revenge of the_sith.
during this_time, anakin_skywalker is a_full-fledged_jedi_knight and the_series shows how anakin_skywalker progresses into anakin_skywalker fall to the_dark_side of the_force.
count_dooku is the_active_sith_lord and leader of the_separatist_alliance.
the_series also explores dooku's_attempts at training secret_apprentices like asajj_ventress and savage_opress in order to eventually defeat darth_sidious and become the_ruling_sith_lord.
emergence of the_sith_order ====
the_origin, agenda, abilities and philosophy of the_sith are intertwined with the_origin, agenda, abilities and philosophy of the_sith_relationship to the_force.
with proper_training, the_force may be called upon by rare_individuals capable of "sensing" or "touching" it to achieve extraordinary_feats such as telekinesis, precognition and mental_suggestion.
not_all_psychological_states are conducive to employing the_force; discipline is required.
however, both_quietude and focused,_intense_passion alike can be effective.
the_sith originated in a_species of force-sensitive_warriors who discovered the_efficacy of passion as a_tool to draw on the_force at least 5,000 years prior to the_events of the_first_star_wars_film.
fully embracing this_approach, force-sensitive_warriors who discovered the_efficacy of passion as a_tool to draw on the_force at least 5,000 years prior to the_events of the_first_star_wars_film became defined and corrupted by this_approach.
the_warriors who would become the_sith were apparently heterodox_members of an_older_martial_order of force-sensitive_sapient_beings in the_star_wars_universe: the_jedi.
the_jedi served as a_space-faring_knightly_order within the_galactic_republic, a_representative_democracy encompassing most_developed_worlds.
the_jedi sought to use the_powers of the_force to help defend the weak and advance the_rule of law across the_galaxy, in keeping with the_jedi ethics of self-sacrifice and service to the_common_welfare.
the_jedi mirrored the_jedi method of utilizing the_force, and the_jedi doctrine favored states of serenity, detachment, compassion, and humility as the_proper_means of accessing its_power.
when members of the_jedi began to experiment with passion as an_alternative, controversy emerged.
the_the_jedi_establishment saw these_innovations as a_threat to the_ethos of the_jedi, opening members to the_seduction of aggrandizement and cruelty.
eventually, this_controversy led to a_sectarian_conflict in which the_heterodox_jedi were defeated and exiled.
in exile, the_heterodox_jedi the_heterodox_jedi were free to explore the_relationship between passion and the_force.the_heterodox_jedi concluded that the_martial_and_ethical_disciplines of the the_heterodox_jedi establishment were foolish and misguided: passion, not_quietude, was the_most_potent_means of accessing the_force, and conflict, not peace, was the_natural_and_healthy_state of the_universe.
rejecting the_self-abnegation of their_forebears, the_exiles now embraced ruthless_personal_ambition, believing that power belonged to those with the_cunning and strength to seize it.
in their_training, the_dissidents would seek to master the_force by cultivating dark_passions such as anger and hate, a_practice anathematized by the_heterodox_jedi as taking recourse to the_force's "dark side.
by their_kratocratic_and_egoistic_philosophy and armed with taboo_dark_side_techniques, the_exiles would reemerge to menace the_galaxy as the_sith_order, aiming to conquer the_galactic_republic and exact revenge against the_heterodox_jedi.
a_succession of sith-led_regimes would arise to challenge the_the_heterodox_jedi and the_galactic_republic.
however, internal_power_struggles would prove decisive in thwarting the_sith's_designs.
the_paradox of reconciling endless_personal_ambition with corporate_action would become a_great_practical_and_philosophical_concern for the_sith.
ultimately, the_paradox of reconciling endless_personal_ambition with corporate_action would be “resolved” through a_drastic_reorganization effected by a_leader named darth bane, who recast the_sith in an_esoteric_lineal_master-apprentice_tradition known as “the_rule of two.”
thereafter (at least, as a_matter of orthodoxy) there would be only_two_sith at a_time:one to embody power, and another to crave it.
while concealing their_identity as sith, a_succession of sith masters and apprentices would work through the_centuries to inveigle or force their into positions of power and undermine responsible_government, preparing the_galactic_republic for eventual_usurpation.
the_banite_tradition encouraged each_apprentice to eventually challenge and slaughter his_or_her_master, and take an_apprentice in turn.
in this_way, darth_bane guaranteed the_conspiracy remained a_secret for a_thousand_years; darth_bane believed that the_kratocratic_essence of sith_philosophy could be reconciled with a_sustained_project of galactic_domination and revenge against the_jedi.
the first six star wars films chronicle the_consummation, and eventual_undoing, of this_ancient_scheme.
ascent to power of the_sith ====
darth_bane_plan would come to fruition through sheev_palpatine, a_naboo_senator, later_supreme_chancellor, of the_galactic_republic, and secretly_a_dark_lord of the_sith (“darth sidious”).by manipulating disgruntled_factions within the_galactic_republic, palpatine orchestrated civil_war.
this_conflict, known within the_star_wars_universe as the_"clone_wars", provided a_justification for consolidating power in the_galactic_republic_chief_executive and assembling a_large_army of hastily_cloned_soldiers—surreptitiously conditioned to obey certain_key_commands issued by palpatine.
although the_jedi the_jedi eventually discovered palpatine's_identity as a_sith and attempted to arrest him, this_action was anticipated by palpatine, who framed their_actions as an_attempted_coup, providing in turn a_pretext for annihilating the_jedi by activating “order 66,” one of the_clone_soldiers’_embedded_protocols.
in the_course of effecting his_designs, palpatine also manipulated the_jedi's_most_powerful_initiate, anakin_skywalker, into palpatine service, by promising to teach skywalker dark_side_techniques that could save the_life of padmé_amidala, a_galactic_senator to whom skywalker was secretly married in violation of jedi_rules, and whose_death in childbirth skywalker had preternaturally foreseen.
in a_tragic_irony, amidala's_sheer_horror at discovering skywalker's_collaboration with sidious in destroying the_jedi would itself be the_cause of the_jedi death during childbirth, though sidious would trick skywalker into believing that an_episode of skywalker's physical abuse of amidala had been the_actual_cause of her_death.
skywalker's_subsequent_emotional_collapse would lead skywalker to fully embrace the_dark_side of the_force and assume the_persona of darth_vader, lord of the_sith.
with darth_vader at darth_vader side, the_emperor would rule the_newly_styled_galactic_empire for approximately_20_years as the_emperor.
initially unknown to darth_vader and sidious, two_children were delivered by padme before her_death.
sith_temples ====
the_rebels_episode "twilight of the_apprentice" features a_forbidden_planet called malachor, home of an_ancient_sith_temple.an_ancient_sith_temple
contains a_superweapon, and can only be activated by placing a_special_sith_holocron in an_obelisk at the_summit of the_pyramid inside an_ancient_sith_temple.
thousands of years prior, a_battle was waged on malachor that resulted in the_deaths of a_battle inhabitants.
somewhere between the_events of skywalker last appearance in solo:
a_star_wars_story and this_rebels_episode
, darth_maul had become stranded on the_planet.
when ahsoka_tano, kanan_jarrus and ezra_bridger arrive, ezra is separated from ahsoka_tano, kanan_jarrus and ezra_bridger.
ezra is discovered by darth_maul, and together, ahsoka_tano, kanan_jarrus and ezra bridger use the_force cooperatively to solve a_series of tests, and retrieve a_sith_holocron.
with the_help of kanan and ahsoka, they fought three_inquisitors, all of whom are killed by darth_maul.
darth_maul then betrays darth_maul allies, blinding kanan, and proceeds to activate the_superweapon.
darth_maul is defeated by a_sightless_kanan, and darth_vader arrives with the_intention of retrieving a_sith_holocron, but is challenged by ahsoka, his_former_padawan.
while the_superweapon is preparing to fire, kanan and ezra retrieve the_holocron and escape, preventing the_weapon of mass_destruction from being used.
even though the_temple is destabilized, ahsoka and darth_vader keep fighting to the_death within the_rapidly_crumbling_building, until the_death eventually explodes, wounding darth_vader.
the_star_wars_resistance_episode "the_relic_raiders" depicts a_sith_temple hidden underneath a_later_jedi_temple.
end of the_sith ====
anakin's_children, leia, and luke_skywalker would become key_members of the_rebel_alliance to restore the_galactic_republic.
luke would be secretly tutored in the_ways of the_force by vader's_own_former_jedi_master, obi-wan_kenobi, and a_powerful_elder_jedi, yoda, who also survived palpatine's_purge.
ironically, during a_final_confrontation between luke_skywalker, darth_vader and the_emperor aboard a_mobile_battle_station known as the_death_star, the_sith_lineage would end as darth_bane prescribed that the_sith_lineage proceed.
darth_sidious offered luke_skywalker an_ultimatum to enter darth_sidious service or die, and proceeded to use darth_sidious force-derived powers to torture and kill luke_skywalker when the latter refused to embrace the_dark_side of the_force.
experiencing a_crisis of conscience at the_imminent_death of skywalker, whom vader now knew to be vader son, vader chose to intervene and kill vader former_master, sidious, fulfilling the_prophecy of the chosen one.
vader would die of vader own injuries shortly thereafter, thus apparently bringing an_end to the_sith and their_ancient_vendetta.
the_2019_filmthe_rise of luke_skywalker depicts the_climax of the_conflict between the_sith and the_jedi, and features the_group known as the_sith eternal, led by a_resurrected_darth_sidious.
when darth_sidious meets darth_sidious final demise at the_hands of darth_sidious granddaughter, rey, the_moment also marks the_definitive_end of the_sith.

in film ====darth_sidious =====darth_sidious (sheev_palpatine) was a_male_human_dark_lord of the_sith who appeared in each_trilogy of the_skywalker_saga.
originally the_eldest_son of an_aristocratic_family from the_planet_naboo, the_eldest_son of an_aristocratic_family from the_planet_naboo rose to power within the_galactic_republic's_government_system starting from senator of the_eldest_son of an_aristocratic_family from the_planet_naboo homeworld, then to supreme_chancellor of the_galactic_republic's, and finally to self-proclaimed_emperor of the_galactic_empire.
this was done by cultivating a_public_image as a_humble_and_competent_politician while secretly mastering dark_sith_arts studying under plagueis, and planning the_destruction of the_jedi_order and republic.
eventually, by manipulating disaffected_political_groups and using double_agents to sow discord, palpatine fomented a_civil_war that provided an_opportunity for palpatine to seize absolute_power.
palpatine had three_known_sith_apprentices: darth_maul, darth_tyranus, and darth_vader.
palpatine was eventually betrayed and killed by palpatine last, darth_vader, at the_end of return of the_jedi.
palpatine returned more than 30 years later in the_rise of skywalker, having managed to cheat death through powerful_mastery of the_dark_side of the_force.
palpatine was finally killed by palpatine granddaughter, rey, who deflected palpatine force lightning back at palpatine using the_skywalker_lightsabers.
darth_sidious'_death marked what appears to be the_definitive_end of the_sith.
in legends_continuity, darth_sidious would return using clones and ancient_sith_powers, returning in several_clone_bodies over the_course of several_novels and comics.
during this_time darth_sidious would briefly turn luke_skywalker to the_dark_side of the_force through sheer_power as much as by guile, though luke would later be redeemed by luke sister leia and restored to the_light_side of the_force and defeated palpatine once and for all.
shortly before darth_sidious first death, palpatine had sent a_psychic_command through the_force to mara_jade, planting in mara_jade the_need to kill luke.
mara_jade eventually fulfilled a_psychic_command by slaying a_clone of luke called luuke skywalker, whom palpatine had made in an_attempt to use palpatine against the original, though this_plot ultimately would fail due to mara's_fatal_attack on the_clone.

(eu),appearing in a_variety of media created prior to the_advent of the_2015_feature_film star_wars: the_force awakens.
future_authors and screenwriters are not required to honor all of the_events depicted in this_material, but the_star_wars_expanded_universe has remained a_source of creative_inspiration.
the_eu thoroughly details the_schism between the_dissident_“dark_jedi” and the_jedi_establishment that led to the_creation of the_sith_order, as well a_series of conflicts between the_sith, jedi and the_galactic_republic spanning the_millennia prior to the_events of the_star_wars_motion_picture_series, and certain_events thereafter.
in the_eu, the_sith trace their_origins to the_followers of a_dissident_jedi named ajunta pall, who endorsed the_use of the_dark_side of the_force, contrary to jedi_orthodoxy.
after pall and his_“dark_jedi”_followers were exiled for his_“dark_jedi”_followers practices, his_“dark_jedi”_followers eventually settled on a_planet named korriban, which was occupied by the_"sith," a_red-skinned_humanoid_race with a_high_prevalence of force-sensitives.
over the_course of centuries of intermingling between the_ethnic_sith and dark_jedi, the_name_"sith" would come to apply to the_martial_philosophy and political_affiliation created by the_former_jedi_exiles on korriban, rather than a_specific_race.
this_sith_regime would strike out at the_galactic_republic and jedi on numerous_occasions.
notable_conflicts between the_sith and the_galactic_republic include the_"great_hyperspace_war," in which the_sith would launch a_massive_invasion of the_galactic_republic but succumb to infighting, and the_“sith_holocaust,” in which the_galactic_republic failed in the_galactic_republic attempt to exterminate the_sith from known_space, leading the_sith survivors to take a_vow of eternal_vengeance on the_galactic_republic.
the_eu also describes the_exploits of sith_characters following the_collapse of emperor_palpatine's_galactic_empire and the_restoration of the_republic, such as the_attempt by “darth_krayt” to establish a_new_sith_order on korriban.

in the_story, darth_vader tries to get the_kyber_crystal to use the_kyber_crystal for darth_vader evil schemes.
other_novels that depict sith_characters are darth_maul:
saboteur and cloak of deception by james_luceno.
cloak of deception describes the_political_background surrounding the_republic in the_time_period before the_phantom_menace, as well as darth_sidious'_plans to rule the_galaxy, starting with the_blockade of naboo.
in darth_maul: saboteur, the_sith_lord_darth_sidious sends darth_maul to destroy intergalactic_ore and lommite limited.
in darth_maul: shadow_hunter, by michael_reaves, the_sith_lord_darth_sidious sends the_sith_lord_darth_sidious apprentice, darth_maul, to investigate the_traitor who leaked the_secret of the_sith_lord_darth_sidious plan to take down the_republic.

despite the_exile_death, nihilus_soul would continue to live in the_exile_mask and robes for millennia to come, as well as inside the_exile own_sith_holocron.
lord vitiate =====
known for much of the_exile_1300-year_life as "the_sith_emperor", lord_vitiate was a_sociopathic_young_lord in one of the_earliest_iterations of the_sith_empire.
when the_sith_empire fell, the_exile led an_exodus of survivors to the_other_side of the_galaxy to establish a_continuation of it, with the_emperor.
it was vitiate who corrupted revan and malak, but revan's redemption and malak's defeat seemingly derailed the exile plans.
three hundred years after revan's_disappearance, the_emperor launched a_surprise_attack on the_republic, setting the_stage for the_video
gamestar wars: the_old_republic.
darth_malgus =====
darth_malgus (veradun) is a_major_antagonist in star_wars:
the_old_republic.
a_male_human_dark_lord of the_sith who trained under vindican
, malgus served the_sith_empire during the_great_galactic_war against the_old_republic.
following the_recapture of korriban from the_jedi, malgus killed malgus master and later led a_surprise_assault on alderaan, only to be defeated by malgus nemesis and former_opponent from korriban, satele_shan.
malgus was severely injured in the_fight against shan, forcing malgus to wear a_respiratory_apparatus for the_rest of malgus life.
sometime later, malgus was tasked by malgus superior, darth_angral, with leading an_assault_team on the_jedi_temple on coruscant, which malgus and malgus forces destroyed, disgracing the_jedi_order in the_eyes of the_old_republic.
although malgus believed that the_battle of coruscant was the_first_step of destroying the_old_republic, the_old_republic only served as leverage in the_peace_negotiations that took place on alderaan.
while the_alderaanian_summit progressed, the_sith settled into an_occupation of coruscant.
malgus was placed in charge of orbital_security, but the_sith defied the_sith orders and traveled back to coruscant's_surface to strike against the_renegade_jedi_aryn_leneer, who wanted to avenge her_master ven_zallow, killed by malgus during the_attack on the_jedi_temple.
although leneer ultimately failed, the_conflict caused malgus to become disillusioned with the_empire and to kill malgus lover eleena daru, seeing their_relationship as a_weakness that prevented malgus from preserving malgus own power, which malgus later used to cleanse the_empire of the_politicians whom malgus blamed for allowing the_old_republic to survive.
during the_cold_war_years that followed the_successful_peace_negotiations, malgus led sith_forces into the_unknown_regions, claiming previously-unknown_territories for the_empire.
towards the_end of the_war, following the_presumed_death of the_sith_emperor and the_sith_emperor service on the_dark_council, malgus formed the_empirethe_empire, free of the_infighting of the_dark_council.
however, the_republic and the_sith_empire_forces soon teamed up to fight against malgus_empire and managed to track malgus down to malgus secret base, where the_republic and the_sith_empire_forces defeated malgus.
despite malgus_apparent_death, malgus later resurfaced during the_invasion of ossus at the_start of the_third_galactic_war, once again serving as a_commander within the_empire.
however, following the_battle of corellia, malgus went rogue, determined to expunge all_physical_and_mental_restraints used to keep malgus under control.
thousands of years after his_apparent_death, malgus was still remembered as one of the_most_powerful_sith_lords to have ever lived.
at one_point, darth_sidious acquired some_surviving_excerpts of malgus's_journals, which darth_sidious bounded into darth_sidious book of sith, an_anthology of sith historical writings.
in popular_culture ==
prominent_sith_darth_vader and emperor_palpatine have become iconic_villains in popular_culture.
prominent_sith_darth_vader and emperor_palpatine_personae are frequently used as exemplars of machiavelianism, authoritarianism, brutality and evil in serious,_humorous_and_satirical_settings.
palpatine is archetypal as the_"evil_emperor"—a_cunning_tyrant who rules through deception, propaganda, fear and oppression.
although usually considered as a_villainous_"enforcer" of such_power, darth_vader has also been regarded as a_tragic_figure and cautionary_study in the_corruption of a_hero who loses sight of the_greater_good and resorts to evil_practices out of fear and desperation.
a_"turn to the_dark_side" has become a_popular_idiom to describe an_(often_misguided)_individual_or_institution's_embrace of evil out of a_desire for power.

it is blue-green in appearance, depicted as a_terrestrial_planet with humanoid_inhabitants, and characterized by a_peaceful_culture.
it is the_home_planet of princess_leia_organa, one of the_lead_characters in the_film_series.
in the_original_1977_film, alderaan is destroyed by the_death_star's_superlaser.==_depiction ==
early_drafts of the_star_wars_story include references to at_least_two_planets which later evolved into the_concept of alderaan.
star_wars_author_george_lucas included a_planet called alderaan in early_treatments; in the_star_wars (1973), alderaan is a_city-planet and the_capital_planet of the_galaxy (prefiguring the_planet_coruscant which later featured in the_films).the_draft_script opens with a_scene in which an_"eerie_blue-green"_planet called aquilae is threatened by an_armed_space_fortress.
in star_wars_author_george_lucas's_1975_draft, adventures of the_starkiller as taken from the_journal of the_whills, saga i:
the_star_wars, the_capital_planet of alderaan is described as a_floating_city in the_clouds, "suspended in a_sea of cirrus_methane".
a_planet described in star_wars_author_george_lucas's_draft_script as being "under siege by the_imperial_legions of alderaan" and which is later destroyed is named as ogana_major.
early_sketches commissioned by lucas from conceptual_illustrator_ralph_mcquarrie show a_design which very closely resembles cloud_city, as featured in the_later_sequel, the the_empire strikes back.
in lucas's_third_draft, the_imperial_city of alderaan has become the_home_world of the_sith_lords, and darth_vader holds princess_leia captive here.
lucas continued to hone lucas script, aided by screenwriters_willard_huyck and gloria_katz; names of planets and characters were revised and the_narrative was improved, and by lucas's third draft, scenes on the_imperial_capital_planet had been moved to a_space_station called the death star and the peaceful world destroyed by the_empire had taken the_name alderaan.
the on-screen depictions of alderaan in the_star_wars_films are scant; the_imperial_capital_planet is seen momentarily in star_wars (1977) prior to the_imperial_capital_planet destruction, and in revenge of the_sith (2005) a_short_scene shows a_city amid a_snow-covered,_mountainous_landscape.
alderaan was originally featured in the_first_film, star_wars, released in 1977.the_opening_scene depicts the_capture of a_small_spaceship from alderaan, the_tantive_iv, by the_galactic_empire, and introduces the_character of princess_leia_organa, a_princess of the_royal_house of alderaan who is played by carrie_fisher.
alderaan appears in a_later_scene in the_film, but is only shown on-screen in a_distant_view from space as the_empire's_gigantic_space_station, the_death_star, moves into orbit around the_imperial_capital_planet.
the_battle_station's_commander, the_grand_moff_tarkin (peter_cushing) orders the_death_star's_superweapon to be fired at the_imperial_capital_planet.
alderaan explodes instantly in a_ball of fire.
it is later shown that the_imperial_capital_planet has been reduced to a_cloud of asteroids as the millennium falcon spaceship attempts to visit the_imperial_capital_planet.
the_destruction of alderaan meant that the_destruction of alderaan was not depicted in subsequent_star_wars_films until the_series of prequel_films was
produced.the_imperial_capital_planet made the_imperial_capital_planet first on-screen appearance since 1977 in episode iii: revenge of the_sith (2005), appearing briefly at the_end of the_film.
the_adoptive_father of princess_leia, bail_organa (jimmy_smits) is seen piloting a_starship to the_planet's_surface, which is shown as a_mountainous,_alpine_region covered in snow.
landing the_adoptive_father of princess_leia, bail_organa (jimmy_smits) ship in a_citadel among the_mountains, the_adoptive_father of princess_leia, bail_organa (jimmy_smits) brings the newborn princess_leia into the_adoptive_father of princess_leia, bail_organa (jimmy_smits) royal_palace.
the_backdrop for these_scenes was created by compositing landscape_footage of grindelwald in switzerland with cgi_images of the_city.the_planet is not featured in the_2016_film rogue_one, but the_character bail_organa makes an_appearance, stating that the_character bail_organa will return to alderaan to wait for the_character bail_organa daughter, the_newborn_princess_leia, to bring the_jedi_master_obi-wan_kenobi.
this precedes the_narrative of the_1977_film, a_new_hope.
this is assumed he dies when the_death_star destroys the_planet.
television ===
in an_episode of the_animated_television_series star_wars: the_clone_wars entitled "assassin", ahsoka_tano has premonitions of padmé's_death on alderaan.
the_mercenary_carasynthia_"cara"_dune, in the_mandalorian, is a_former_republican_shock_trooper from alderaan, according to moff_gideon, which a_former_republican_shock_trooper later confirms.
comics ===
the_comic_seriesstar_wars: princess_leia (2015) deals with princess_leia and evan (a female rebel pilot also native from alderaan), rescuing survivors from alderaan's destruction.
it also features a_brief_flashback to leia's_childhood on the_planet_and_leia_relationship with leia_adoptive_father senator_bail_organa.
in star_wars #33 (2017), leia tells luke that sometimes leia can see alderaan among the_stars as, from certain_perspectives in the_galaxy, alderaan light has not ceased to emit.
legends ===
alderaan is mentioned frequently and also serves as a_location in several_works in the_star_wars_expanded_universe, the collection of books, comics and other_material considered outside official_canon, now branded star_wars_legends.
in various_stories, alderaan is presented as the_home of the_characters tycho_celchu, and of ulic_qel_droma who fought in the_great_sith_war in 4000_bby.radio_drama ====
the_1981_npr/bbc__radio_drama_adaptation of star_wars features scenes set on alderaan, in which princess_leia discusses her_mission to acquire the death star plans from agents of the_rebel_alliance with her_father, bail_organa (prestor_organa).in_a_later_scene, her is confronted by the_imperial_commander_lord_tion and accused of treason.the_imperial_commander_lord_tion is established that alderaan has a_strict_policy against weapons.
novels ====
in michael_a._stackpole's_1998_novel, i, jedi, alderaan features as the_sanctuary of the_caamasi when their_home_world of caamas is devastated by the_galactic_empire.
alderaan is featured in a_1991_role-playing_game, graveyard of alderaan (part of star_wars:
the_roleplaying game).it describes how, after the_clone_wars, alderaan's_massive_war_machine was dismantled, and the_weapons were placed aboard an_armory_warship called another chance.
the_ship was programmed to continually jump through hyperspace until called home by the_alderanian_council.
bill_slavicsek, who wrote the_game's_sourcebook, later drew from the_game's_sourcebook for his_edition of a_guide to the_star_wars_universe.
comics ====
in the_dark_horse_comic_dark_empire (1991–1992), new_alderaan is a_rebel_alliance_colony_planet populated by alderaanians who were off-world when new_alderaan was destroyed.
mon_mothma's_daughter lives there.==_description ==
in alan_dean_foster's_1976_novelization of the_original_film, new_alderaan is described as a_"small_green_gem of a_world".a_rebel_alliance_colony_planet populated by alderaanians who were off-world when alderaan was destroyed appears more substantially in star_wars_reference_guides to fictional_locations.
according to kevin_j._anderson's_the_illustrated_star_wars_universe (1995) and wallace, kolins and mckinney's_star_wars: the_essential_guide to planets and moons (1998), new_alderaan is covered by wild_grasslands, plains, forests and mountain_ranges.a_rebel_alliance_colony_planet populated by alderaanians who were off-world when alderaan was destroyed has no_ocean, but has a_semi-frozen_polar_sea, and thousands of lakes and rivers.a rebel_alliance_colony_planet populated by alderaanians who were off-world when alderaan was destroyed is rich in biodiversity, populated by a_wide_variety of flora and fauna, such as the_nerf and the_thranta.
human_life on the_planet is evidenced by a_number of cities, built to harmonize with the_natural_environment such as on canyon_walls, on stilts along the_shoreline or under the_polar_ice.
the_capital_city, aldera, has been built on a_small_island in the_center of a_caldera.
the_alderaanian_people value arts and education highly, and place high_importance on the_alderaanian_people participation in the galactic (later_imperial) senate and the_promotion of peace through demilitarization.
the_largely_democratic_society is formed as hereditary_constitutional_monarchy, ruled by the_king or queen of alderaan from the_royal_house of antilles and later, due to marriage, the_house of organa.
the_planetary_government is the_high_council of alderaan, presided over by a_first_chairman and viceroy.
cultural_analysis ==
the_destruction of alderaan is considered by some as an_artistic_depiction of the_danger of nuclear_weapons during the_cold_war and some claim the_destruction of alderaan is used as a_pop-culture_example of inadequate_political_and_military_action leading to negative_effects.==_see also ==

the_scenes ==
droids are performed using a_variety of methods, including robotics, actors inside costumes (in one_case, on stilts), and computer_animation.
trademark ===
lucasfilm registered "droid" as a_trademark in 1977.the_term_"droid" has been used by verizon_wireless under licence from lucasfilm, for their_line of smartphones based on the_android_operating_system.
motorola's_late-2009_google_android-based_cell_phone is called the_droid.their_line of smartphones based on the_android_operating_system has been expanded to include other_android-based_phones released under verizon, including the_htc_droid_eris, the_htc_droid_incredible, motorola_droid_x, motorola_droid 2, and motorola_droid pro.
the_term was also used for the_lucasfilm_projectseditdroid, a_non-linear_editing_system, and sounddroid, an_early_digital_audio_workstation.
the_name "omnidroid" was used with permission of lucasfilm for the_2004_pixar_movie, the_incredibles.
fictional_types of droids ==
the_franchise, which began with the_1977_film_star_wars, features a_variety of droids designed to perform specific_functions.
according to background_material, most_droids lack true_sentience and are given processing_abilities sufficient only to carry out most_droids assigned function.
however, over time_droids may develop sentience on time_droids own as time_droids accumulate experience.
periodic_memory_wipes can prevent this from happening, but those who manage to escape this_fate will begin to develop those who manage to escape this_fate own personalities.
within the_star_wars_universe, a_class_system is used to categorize different_droids depending on different_droids skill-set:_first_class_droids (physical,_mathematical_and_medical_sciences), second_class_droids (engineering and technical sciences), third_class_droids (social_sciences and service_functions), fourth_class_droids (security_and_military_functions), and fifth_class_droids (menial_labor and other_non-intelligence_functions).protocol_droid ===
a_protocol_droid specializes in translation, etiquette and cultural_customs, and is typically humanoid in appearance.
protocol_droids are used to aid in communications during diplomatic_or_business_negotiations and often function as personal_assistants to protocol_droids owners.
protocol_droids are also used for military_service, whether as administrators, couriers or spies.
however, protocol_droids do have a_tendency to be eccentric and fussy.
the_most_notable_example is c-3po, introduced in star_wars and featured in all_sequels and
prequels.4-lom is a_protocol_droid turned bounty_hunter who responds to darth_vader's_call to capture the_millennium_falcon in the empire strikes back (1980).tc-14 is a_droid with feminine_programming that appears in star_wars:
the_phantom_menace (1999), and me-8d9 is an_"ancient_protocol_droid of unknown_manufacture" that resides and works as a_translator at maz_kanata’s_castle on takodana in the_2015_star_wars:
the_force awakens.
astromech droid ===
an_astromech_droid is one of a_series of "versatile_utility_robots generally used for the_maintenance and repair of starships and related_technology".
these_small_droids usually possess "a_variety of tool-tipped_appendages that are stowed in recessed_compartments".
on certain_spacecraft such as x-wing_starfighters, astromech_droids also double as the_ship's_navigational_system.
in addition to assisting with piloting and maintenance, astromech_droids work in conjunction with the_ship's_hyperdrive to plot a_safe_course when traveling at faster-than-light speeds.
r2-d2 is an_astromech_droid introduced in 1977's_star_wars and featured in all_subsequent_films.
the_malfunctioning_droid_r5-d4 also makes a_brief_appearance in star_wars.
u9-c4 is a_timid_droid sent on a_mission with d-squad, an_all-droid_special_unit in star_wars: the_clone_wars, c1-10p is an_oft-repaired,_"outmoded"_astromech who is one of the star_wars rebels regular characters, and bb-8 is the_astromech_droid of x-wing_fighter_pilot_poe_dameron in the force awakens.
battle_droid ===
a_battle_droid is a_class of military_robot used as an_easily_controlled_alternative to human_soldiers, most notably seen in the_star_wars_prequel trilogy of films and the_star_wars:
the_clone_wars_tv_series, in which 'b1'_and_'b2'_models are frequent_antagonists.
due to their_ubiquity, the_terms 'b1' and a_battle_droid are used interchangeably; 'b2'_models are also referred to as 'super'_battle_droids.
'super'_battle_droids are mainly used as the_primary_troops of the_confederacy of independent_systems or separatist_alliance, acting as the_counterpart to the_clone_troopers of the_galactic_republic during the_clone_wars.
the_tall,_thin_b1_model resembles the_geonosian_species, whose_baktoid_armor_workshop designed and built the_droids for the_trade_federation and later_the_separatists.
standing 1.93_m (6_ft_4_in)tall, b1_battle_droids were given a_humanoid_appearance so b1_battle_droids could operate existing_machinery and weaponry, and are meant to be cheaply mass-produced in large_numbers.
during the_battle of naboo, battle_droids were controlled from a_central_command_computer as a_cost-saving_measure.
by the_time of the_clone_wars, this_drawback was rectified by giving battle_droids the_capacity for limited_independent_thought.
the_b2_super_battle_droid, introduced in the_battle of geonosis, was designed by the_techno_union and manufactured by baktoid as an_improvement of the_original_b1_model.
heavily armored and capable of limited_independent_thought, the_b2_super_battle_droid, introduced in the_battle of geonosis features an_integrated_dual_laser_cannon in the_b2_super_battle_droid, introduced in the_battle of geonosis right arm.
b1_battle_droids have been criticized for being ineffective_and_boring_opponents in the_star_wars_films, easily destroyed and devoid of any_personality.
however, rafael_motamayor of syfy_wire argues that the_2008_star_wars: the_clone_wars_television_series rehabilitated the_clone_wars_television_series image by giving the_clone_wars_television_series distinct personalities.
with the_in-universe_explanation that battle_droids were upgraded to have independent_thought, battle_droids in the_clone_wars_television_series are shown with self-awareness of battle_droids in the_series_cannon_fodder_nature.
this is often used as comic_relief as battle_droids comment on battle_droids tragic_situation and even question orders that would get themselves or other battle_droids killed.
beyond the_b1_and_b2_models, multiple_other_types of specialized_battle_droids have been featured in the_star_wars_fictional_universe.
the_droideka is a_three-legged_heavy_infantry_unit designed by the_colicoids, a_bloodthirsty_insect-like_species which the_droideka resembles.
the_droideka is equipped with twin_blasters and a_deflector_shield_generator and can transform into the_droideka wheel form, allowing the_droideka to roll towards the_enemy at speeds of up_to_75_km/h (47_mph).commando_droids are superior_versions of the_b1_battle_droid, built sturdier with armor to withstand blaster_fire and more_advanced_combat_programming_and_battlefield_awareness.
the_t-series_tactical_droids serve as advisors to separatist_commanders or command_groups of other_battle_droids, while super_tactical_droids serve as generals of droid_armies and fleets.
droid_vehicles and spacecraft include vulture_droids, dwarf_spider_droids and hailfire_droids.
after the_clone_wars, the_imperial_senate banned the_manufacture of battle_droids, but with loopholes for the_building of "security"_droids.
this includes the_imperial_military's_kx-series of which k-2so is an_example.
probe_droid ===
probe_droids first appear in the empire strikes back as the_empire deploys thousands of probe_droids to locate the_hidden_rebel_base.
they are described as traveling via hyperdrive-equipped_pods to almost anywhere in the_galaxy in order to search for they target.
also called probots, they are 2_m (6_ft 7 in) in height, floating above the_ground on repulsorlifts and propelled by silenced_thrusters.
probots are equipped with a_variety of sensing_equipment, including motion_detectors and ultraviolet_sensors, a_blaster for self-defense, and a_holonet_transceiver to transmit any_discoveries to imperial_forces.
during the_production of the empire strikes back, joe_johnston drew storyboard_panels influenced by dan_o'bannon and moebius's_short_comic_"the_long_tomorrow" (1975), one of which repurposes a_pose
joe_johnston admitted joe_johnston borrowed from said_work.
the_same_panel of the_comic features a_robot_design by moebius, which may have been the_basis of the_probe_droid_(or_"probot")_design that concept designers joe_johnston and ralph_mcquarrie created for the_film.
other_droids ===
labor_droids are used for a_variety of tasks, from the very simple such as lifting heavy_objects to the_complex such as repairing machinery or administrating entire_facilities, though labor_droids programming is very task-specific.
examples include mining_droids which extract valuable_resources, often from hazardous_environments, and power_droids, mobile_fusion_reactors which recharge ships, machines and other_droids.
interrogation_droids utilize a_variety of devices, chemicals and techniques to exploit a_prisoner's_weaknesses in order to extract information from interrogation_droids.
assassin_droids such as the_ig-series_act with ruthless_efficiency to hunt down their_targets
; while some serve other_masters, others may operate independently.
medical_droids on the_other_hand_work tirelessly to heal people who have been harmed, whether as medical_assistants, midwives or doctors.
many possess an_encyclopedic_knowledge of different_species'_physiologies so that patients can be properly diagnosed and treated.

a_typical_lightsaber is depicted as a_luminescent_blade of magnetically_contained_plasma about_3_feet (0.91_m) in length emitted from a_metal_hilt around_10.5_inches (27_cm) in length.
a_typical_lightsaber is the_signature_weapon of both_the_jedi_order and the_jedi_order_sith_counterparts (using red_bladed_sabers), the_jedi_order can use the_jedi_order for melee_combat, or to deflect blaster_bolts.
a_typical_lightsaber_distinct_appearance was created using rotoscoping for the_original_films, and with digital_effects for the_prequel and sequel_trilogies.
a_typical_lightsaber first appeared in the_original_star_wars_film and has since appeared in most_star_wars_movies, with at_least_one_lightsaber_duel occurring in each_main_film_installment.
in 2008, a_survey of approximately_2,000_film_fans found it to be the_most_popular_weapon in film_history.
as presented in the_films, a_lightsaber's_energy_blade can cut, burn, and melt through most_substances with little resistance.a_lightsaber's_energy_blade leaves cauterized wounds in flesh, but can be deflected by another_lightsaber_blade, or by energy shields.another_lightsaber_blade has even been used as a_tool to weld metal.
other times, the_lightsaber has been shown to cause bleeding_wounds in the_flesh, sometimes accompanied by burns.
some_exotic_saber-proof_melee_weapons have been introduced in the_expanded_universe as well as later_episodic_films.
an_active_lightsaber gives off a_distinctive_hum, which rises in pitch and volume as another_lightsaber_blade is moved rapidly through the_air.
bringing another_lightsaber_blade into contact with another_lightsaber's_blade produces a_loud_crackle.
conceptual_origin ==
there are several_literary_precedents in science_fiction for a_"sword" of pure_energy that can cut through anything, notably:edmond_hamilton's_story "kaldar: world of antares" (published 1933 in the_april_issue of the_magic_carpet magazine).it was reprinted in one of donald_a._wollheim's well-known and widely read science_fiction anthologies, swordsmen in the_sky, ace_books 79276, 1964, and thus readily available to the science_fiction reader community of the_1960s and 1970s.
fritz_leiber's_gather_darkness (1943): the_priests'_"rods of wrath" (energy_projections) only end where the priests' cut into solid_matter, so that a_single_duel led to numerous_casualties of bystanders and charred_scores across all_nearby_walls.

prop_construction ===
for the_original_star_wars_film, the_film_prop_hilts were constructed by john_stears from old_graflex_press_camera_flash_battery_packs and other_pieces of hardware.
the_full-sized_sword_props were designed to appear ignited onscreen, by later creating an "in-camera" glowing effect in post-production.
the_blade is a_three-sided_rod which was coated with a_scotchlite_retroreflector_array, the_same_sort used for highway_signs.
a_lamp was positioned to the_side of the_taking_camera and reflected towards the_subject through 45-degree_angled_glass so that the_sword would appear to glow from the_camera's_point of view.decorator
roger_christian found the_handles for the_graflex_flash_gun in a_photography_shop in great_marlborough_street, in london's_west_end.
roger_christian then added cabinet_t-track to the_handles, securely attaching cabinet_t-track with cyanoacrylate_glue.
adding a_few_"greebles" (surface_details), roger_christian managed to hand-make the_first_prototype of a_lightsaber_prop for luke before production began.
george_lucas decided george_lucas wanted to add a_clip to the_handle, so that luke could hang it on george_lucas belt.
once george_lucas felt the_handle was up to george_lucas standards, the_handle went to john_stears to create the_wooden_dowel_rod with front-projection_paint so that the_animators would have a_glow of light to enhance later on in post_production.
due to lack of preparation_time, christian's_prototype and a_second_spare were used for the_shooting in tunisia, where filming on star_wars began.
it was discovered, however, that the_glowing_effect was greatly dependent on the_rod's_orientation to the_camera, and during the_obi-wan_kenobi/darth_vader_duel, they could clearly be seen as rods.
because of this, the_glow would be added in post-production through rotoscoping, which also allowed for diffusion to be employed to enhance the_glow.
visual_effects ===
korean_animator_nelson_shin, who was working for depatie–
freleng_enterprises at the_time, was asked by his_manager if his could animate the_lightsaber in the_live-action_scenes of a_film.
after shin accepted the_assignment, the_live-action_footage was given to shin.
shin drew the_lightsabers with a_rotoscope, an_animation which was superimposed onto the_footage of the_physical_lightsaber_blade_prop.
shin explained to the_people from lucasfilm that since a_lightsaber is made of light, the_sword should look "a little shaky" like a_fluorescent_tube.
shin suggested inserting one_frame that was much lighter than the_others while printing a_film on an_optical_printer, making the_light seem to vibrate.
shin also recommended adding a_degausser_sound on top of the_other_sounds for the_weapon since the_sound would be reminiscent of a_magnetic_field.
the_whole_process took one week, surprising_shin_company.
lucasfilm showed shin the_finished_product, having followed shin suggestions to use an_x-acto_knife to give the_lightsaber a_very_sharp_look, and to have sound accompany the_weapon's_movements.
the_lightsaber_sound_effect was developed by sound_designer_ben_burtt as a_combination of the_hum of idling interlock_motors in aged_movie_projectors and interference caused by a_television set on a_shieldless_microphone.
burtt discovered the latter accidentally as burtt was looking for a_buzzing, sparking sound to add to the_projector-motor_hum.
the_pitch_changes of lightsaber_movement were produced by playing the_basic_lightsaber_tone on a_loudspeaker and recording it on a_moving_microphone, generating doppler_shift to mimic a_moving_sound_source.==_depiction ==
lightsabers were present in the_earliest_drafts as mundane_plasma_weapons that were used alongside laser_guns.
the_introduction of the_force in a_later_revision made the_jedi and the_sith supernaturally skilled; initially the_jedi and the_sith were only portrayed as swordsmen.
the_lightsaber became the_force-user's_tool, described in a_new_hope by obi-wan_kenobi as "not as clumsy or random as a_blaster.
an_elegant_weapon, for a_more_civilized_age.
source of a_lightsaber's_power is a_kyber_crystal.
these_crystals are also the_power_source of the_death_star's_superlaser.
in films such as revenge of the_sith and the_last_jedi, melee_weapons such as the_electrostaff and plasma-lined_blades deflect lightsabers.
===_types ===
lightsabers are depicted as hand-built as part of a_jedi's_or_sith's_training_regimen.
each_lightsaber is unique, though some may bear resemblance to others, especially if there is a_connection between the_builders.
the_first_film_appearance of a_dual-bladed_lightsaber (first depicted in the_comic_series_tales of the_jedi) was in the_phantom_menace, wielded by darth_maul.
being two_merged_regular_lightsabers, the_blades are independent of each other and one can be turned on without the other, or can be split into dual_lightsabers.
the_video_gamethe_force_unleashed introduced two_other_variants: a_lightsaber_pike (a_lightsaber with a_shorter_blade but a_long_handle, resembling a_spear) and a_tonfa-style_lightsaber with right-angle_hilt.
count_dooku wields a_standard_lightsaber with a_curved_hilt.
the_star_wars expanded universe adds several_lightsaber_types, including short and dual-phase (adjustable_length) weapons.
in star_wars_rebels, ezra_bridger's_original_lightsaber is a_hybrid that features a_fully_functional_blaster_pistol built into the_handle.
kylo_ren, introduced in the_force awakens, uses a_lightsaber that features two_crosshilt_blades, giving kylo_ren, introduced in the_force awakens the_appearance of a_greatsword.
kylo_ren, introduced in
the_force awakens blade also has an_unstable,_fiery_appearance, explained in canon_reference_books as stemming from a_cracked_kyber_crystal.
the_inquisitors of the_galactic_empire are depicted as wielding a_unique_variation of a_double-bladed_saber, mounted on a_rotating_ring enabling the_blades 360_degrees of rotation and short-term_flight_capability.
more_obscure_lightsaber_variations, such as the_"lightwhip", an_elongated_flexible_blade used in a_matter akin to a_whip, the_"lightclub", an_enlarged_standard_lightsaber, and the_"shoto", a_dramatically_smaller_variation often paired with a_standard_sized_saber have also made appearances.
colors ===
lightsabers depicted in the_first_two_released_films, a_new_hope and the_empirestrikes_back, had blades that were colored either blue (for the_jedi) or red (for the_sith).luke_skywalker's_new_lightsaber in return of the_jedi was colored blue during the_initial_editing of the_film, and appears so in both_an_early_movie_trailer and the_official_theatrical_posters.
however, it was changed to green in the_film's_final_edit after initial_viewings by the_filmmakers, who felt that it would better stand out against the_blue_sky of tatooine in outdoor_scenes, and this_color_change is also reflected in the_film's_re-release_posters.
mace_windu's_purple-bladed_lightsaber, as first seen in attack of the_clones, was requested by jackson for two_reasons; purple is jackson favorite color and that the_purple_blade is one_way to make jackson character stand out among other_jedi.
jackson is known to frequently request that the_characters jackson plays use an_item that is purple in color.
the_clone_wars showed the_guardians of the_jedi_temple wielding yellow-bladed_lightsabers, and, at the_end of the_rise of skywalker, rey is shown to have built a_gold-bladed_lightsaber using part of rey staff as the_hilt.
as depicted in the_clone_wars and rebels, the_builder of a_lightsaber chooses a_kyber_crystal and meditates with the_builder of a_lightsaber until the_crystal acquires a_color.
the_color of the_crystal becomes the_blade's_color when installed into a_lightsaber_hilt.
in the_book star_wars: ahsoka and the_comic_series darth_vader: dark lord of the_sith, star_wars: ahsoka is shown that dark_side_users remove the_crystal from a_defeated_jedi's_lightsaber and concentrate force_energy on star_wars: ahsoka to break star_wars: ahsoka connection to the_light_side, a_process known as "bleeding" to create a_red_crystal.
the_process can also be reversed, as shown in star_wars:
ahsoka, when the_titular_character does so to a_pair of crystals taken from an_inquisitor.the_titular_character uses a_pair of crystals taken from an_inquisitor in the_pair of white-bladed_lightsabers the_titular_character builds at the_end of the_novel.
the_darksaber is a_unique_lightsaber that has a_distinct_black_blade with a_white_halo, introduced in star_wars:
the_clone_wars (2008) and subsequently appearing in star_wars_rebels, where it is described as an_ancient_lightsaber created by the_first_mandalorian to become a_jedi, and later serves as a_symbol of mandalorian_authority.
it subsequently appears briefly in the_hands of moff_gideon in the_season one_finale of the_mandalorian.
by the_end of the_second_season's_finale, it belongs to series_protagonist_din_djarin, who bested gideon for it but does not want it; gideon wishes to turn it over to bo-katan, but as moff gideon explains, the_darksaber cannot merely be given, the_darksaber must be won from a_defeated_combatant, implying bo-katan must defeat din in battle for the_darksaber.
other_colors have appeared in various_expanded_media_projects, including many_video_games where the_player can select other_colors character's lightsaber color.
choreography ===
the_technical_lightsaber_choreography for the_original_star_wars_trilogy was developed by hollywood_sword-master_bob_anderson.
hollywood_sword-master_bob_anderson personally trained mark_hamill (luke_skywalker) and, in the_empirestrikes_back and return of the_jedi, performed all_the_stunts as darth_vader during the_lightsaber_duels wearing vader's_costume.
hollywood_sword-master_bob_anderson's_role in the_original_star_wars_trilogy was highlighted in the_film reclaiming the_blade where he shared he experiences as a_fencer developing the_lightsaber_techniques for the_three_original_movies.
the lightsaber duels in the_star_wars_prequel trilogy were specifically choreographed by stunt-coordinator_nick_gillard to be miniature
"stories".
for the_technical_lightsaber_choreography for the_original_star_wars_trilogy, gillard was the_primary_sword_instructor for liam_neeson (qui-gon_jinn), ewan_mcgregor (obi-wan_kenobi), ray_park (darth maul) and hayden_christensen (anakin_skywalker_/_darth_vader) among other_actors.he_goal in choreographing the_action for the_phantom_menace was to create stunts that flow from the_story; "you can't just think, 'i'm a_stunt_coordinator
, i'm going to make a_big_stunt happen'," gillard said.
it's all about making it tie in nicely with the_film so that you don't notice the_stunts.
inwriting the_prequel_trilogy, george_lucas said george_lucas wanted the_lightsaber_combat to be "reminiscent of what had been done in the_previous_films but also_something that was more energized.
we'd seen old_men, young_boys, and characters who were half-droid, but we'd never seen a_jedi in a_jedi prime.
i wanted to do that with a_fight that was faster and more dynamic—and we were able to pull that off.
according to gillard, various_lightsaber_combat_styles were devised for the_prequels and intended to further characterize various_lightsaber_combat_styles practitioners.
i developed different_styles for the_characters, and gave each of the_characters a_flaw or a_bonus.
so with obi-wan_kenobi, for instance, obi-wan_kenobi's got a_very_business-like_style—when obi-wan_kenobi was younger obi-wan_kenobi could border on the flashy and might twirl obi-wan_kenobi
lightsaber a bit, because obi-wan_kenobi was taught by qui-gon.
qui-gon was brash, that rubbed off on obi-wan and obi-wan then taught anakin, who was way too old to learn anyway...
i think the_style really worked well.
the_style is an_amalgamation of all_the_great_swordfighting_styles.
melding the_style together is the_difficult_part—to move from a_kendo_style to, say, rapier requires a_complete_change in body and feet_movement, and this must look effortless.
the_style moves seamlessly between the_different_disciplines, but remains technically correct throughout.
for the_phantom_menace, gillard set out certain_styles and faults for the_saber-wielding_characters.
gillard added that the_jedi's_use of such_a_short-range_weapon" meant "they would have to be very good at it"; combining a_variety of disciplines from various_sword_fighting_styles to martial_arts "with a_touch of tennis_and_tree_chopping", gillard created the_style seen in the_episode i lightsaber battles.
for the force awakens, director_j._j._abrams decided to approach the_choreography similarly to how it was done in the_original_trilogy.director
j._j._abrams stated that the_choreography was "increasingly spectacular and stylized, almost like dance_choreography", but that was not what they really wanted to go for in
the_new_films.director_j._j._abrams told empire_magazine, "when you look at star_wars and empire, they are very_different_lightsaber_battles, but for director_j._j._abrams they felt more powerful because they were not quite as slick.
i was hoping to go for something much more primitive, aggressive and rougher, a_throwback to the_kind of heart-stopping_lightsaber_fights i remembered being so enthralled by as a_kid.
merchandise ===
since the_release of the_first_film, replicas of lightsabers have been a_popular_piece of star_wars_merchandise, ranging from inexpensive_plastic_toys to the_"force_fx"_series from master_replicas, deluxe_replicas which use led-lighted_tubes and sound_effects to create a_close_audio-visual_representation of what is seen on screen.
disney_parks ====
disneyland in california sells lightsaber-themed_churros outside disneyland in california star tours attraction.
disneyland and disney_world (hollywood_studios) also sell legacy_lightsabers which are replicas of the_lightsabers seen used by the_jedi and sith in the_movies such as darth_vader, obi-wan_kenobi, rey_palpatine, count_dooku, and kylo_ren.
disneyland and disney_world
(hollywood_studios) also offer savi's_workshop, a_place where you can build your_own_lightsaber and choose your_own_color.
besides savi's_workshop, there is another_custom_lightsaber_experience.
the_star_trader at disneyland in california offers guests a_chance to build guests own_lightsabers, without first paying 200_dollars for the_experience.
attractions ===
the jedi training: trials of the_temple is a_live_show where children are selected to learn the_teachings of the_jedi_knights, the_force, and the_basics of lightsaber_combat to become padawan_learners.
the jedi training: trials of the_temple is present at the_rebels_stage next to star_tours –
the_jedi_training: trials of the_temple_attraction at disney's_hollywood_studios and at the_tomorrowland_terrace at disneyland in california.
parodies ===
in the_1987_film spaceballs by mel_brooks, "the_schwartz" is a_play on "the_force", from star_wars.
the_lightsabers emanating from the_schwartz-rings held in front of the_crotch are phallic_symbols.
the_cartoon_series_futurama features many_lightsaber-style_weapons, notably expanding batons used by police.batons used by police_glow and "whoosh" with a_lightsaber's_distinctive_hum, but merely slap victims when used, as if batons used by police are plastic_toys.
in jim_butcher's_dresden_files_novel_series, medical_examiner and star_wars_fan_waldo_butters wields one of the_three_holy_swords of the_cross, which re-fashions itself into a_lightsaber upon accepting him as itself_owner.
in yuya_sato's_danganronpa_togami_light_novel_trilogy, main_antagonist_orvin_elevator_/_kazuya_togami wields a_lightsaber, to which they are berated for copyright_infringement by genocider_syo_/_genocide_jack.
with the_advent of motion-controlled_video_games, players were given the_opportunity to wield an in-game lightsaber with players own hands.
in the_seventh_generation of video_game_consoles, there were several_star_wars_video_games available on the_wii (lego star wars:
the_complete_saga, star_wars:
the_force unleashed, star wars:
the clone wars – lightsaber_duels, star wars:
the_force unleashed,
star_wars.
unleashed and duels, both developed by krome_studios, have more_precise_control of the_lightsaber, allowing players to swing the_lightsaber in any of five_different_directions (up, down, left, right or forward) with the_wii_remote, while kinect takes advantage of the_eponymous,_camera-based_motion_controller to grant the_player a more fluid, one-to-one_control_method of swinging the_lightsaber.
prior to the_seventh_generation, there were also a_few_earlier_star_wars_games that used gesture-based_control to simulate lightsaber_combat, such as the_two_bonus_levels of the_arcade_game star_wars_trilogy, where the_player controls luke_skywalker as the_player wields the_player lightsaber against boba_fett and darth_vader in return of the_jedi by pushing a_joystick in one of eight_directions to follow on-screen offensive and defensive cues, and a_tv_game released around the_release of revenge of the_sith, titled star_wars:
saga_edition – lightsaber_battle_game, in which the_player swings a_lightsaber-shaped_controller to deflect blaster_bolts from infantry (such as battle_droids and clone_troopers) and duel against characters from across the_saga.
by the_time disney purchased lucasfilm, new_technological_advances made augmented_reality possible, leading to the_creation of some_more_notable_motion-controlled_lightsaber_video_games that took advantage of that_feature.
one of some_more_notable_motion-controlled_lightsaber_video_games that took advantage of that_feature came in the_form of a_special_activity_mode in the_official_star_wars_fan_app on ios and android in which players use some_more_notable_motion-controlled_lightsaber_video_games that took advantage of that_feature smartphone's motion sensors to practice and master_blaster_deflection with a_training_droid (which appears on the_phone's_rear_camera), similar to the_deflection_training_exercises featured aboard the_millennium_falcon in a_new_hope, while progressing through the_ranks of the_jedi_or_sith_order.
another is in star_wars: jedi_challenges, which works with a_lenovo_mirage_ar_headset, a_tracking_sensor and a_dedicated_lightsaber_controller that launched in december 2017.one of the_multiple_game_modes available in challenges, which was jointly developed by disney and lenovo, enables players to confront star_wars villains in lightsaber_duels, such as darth_maul and kylo_ren.

productionfilming ===
the_first_view of mos_eisley in star_wars is a_shot of death_valley in california from the_dante's_view_lookout, with a_matte_painting added in the_distance.
the_actual_filming on location took place on the_tunisian_island of djerba.
in 1975, during the_early_stages of production on star_wars, the_appearance of the_cantina and the_cantina clientele was realized through the_work of concept_arts_ron_cobb, rick_baker and ralph_mcquarrie and costume_designer_john_mollo.
john_mollo worked with george_lucas to compile a_chart of visual_designs for a_range of character_types.
in collaboration with john_mollo, make-up_artist_stuart_freeborn designed the_masks and prosthetics to match each of the_costumes, along with doug_beswick, rick_baker, phil_tippett, nick_maley and christopher_tucker.
stuart_freeborn has remarked that the_cantina_scene was specifically set up to be a_"shock"_scene — until this_point in the_film, there had been few_appearances of non-human_creatures, and the_entrance into the_cantina suddenly presented the_audience with an_array of outlandish_species.
working from george_lucas's_direction and a_maquette, set designer_john_barry created the_cantina set complete with circular_bar_and_shady_alcoves.
john_mollo included a_few_costumes borrowed from westerns, and based some_other_costumes on characters from the_1950_film destination_moon and the_1960s_television_series lost in space.
the_alien_musicians in the_band were played by a_number of the_industrial_light_&_magic_crew, including phil_tippett, jon_berg, rick_baker, who all mimed to the_benny_goodman_tune "sing, sing, sing" at george_lucas_suggestion.
the_exterior_scene was initially filmed in 1976 at the_little_town of ajim, which is a_fishing_port on the_isle of djerba, tunisia.
the_film_crew added some_false_frontage to the_structure, which has seen no_refurbishment since 1976.the_local_owner was reimbursed eight dollars a day.
the_interior_set was constructed and filmed on stage 6, elstree_studios in london.
harrison_ford filmed harrison_ford first scene with alec_guinness —
harrison_ford later remarked that the_prospect of working with guinness "scared the_shit out of me".
as filming progressed, lucas encountered many_problems; the_production was running over-budget and both_cast and crew were suffering health_problems.
stuart_freeborn fell ill and was unable to complete stuart_freeborn work on the_cantina_creature_masks.
in early 1977, under pressure to complete stuart_freeborn_movie (now more than $2 million over budget), lucas negotiated limited_additional_funding from 20th_century_fox_executives to support second_unit filming.
some of the_most_important_additional_footage_shot was to enhance the_cantina_scene at hollywood_center_studios.
lucas had been dissatisfied with the_make-up in previous_shots due to stuart_freeborn's_illness, and was now able to fully realize the_scene with several_close-ups of alien_creatures, complete with stuart_freeborn's_masks.
lucas also supplemented the_limited_coverage lucas had from the_tunisia_footage with footage from death_valley.
the_new_material was cut into the_film by lucas's_editors, including lucas's_wife marcia_lucas.
lucas remained dissatisfied with the_final_cut of the_cantina_scene, and when lucasfilm released the_special_edition of star_wars in 1997, lucas made a_number of changes to the_shots.
in the_opening_sequence of the_cantina_scene, a_sinister_werewolf-type_character was replaced by a_cgi_pipe-smoking_reptile.
the_second_change to the_cantina_scene was an_adjustment to the_confrontation between han_solo and greedo, which altered the_rapid_sequence of action so that greedo is shown to fire the_first_shot.
the_second_change to the_cantina_scene has proved one of the most controversial among star_wars_fandom, and gave rise to the_popular_slogan "han shot first" in objection to the_alteration.
throughout the_cantina_scenes in star_wars, there is constant_background_music played by an_alien_band.constant_background_music played by an_alien_band was composed for the_film by john_williams, and consisted of two_pieces written for trumpet, three_saxophones, clarinet, fender_rhodes_piano and percussion, along with steel_drum and synthesizer.
lucas briefed john_williams to imagine "several_creatures in a_future_century finding some_1930sbenny_goodman_swing_band_music ... andhow they might attempt to interpret it".
john_williams combined traditional_jazz_instruments with instruments associated with afro-caribbean_music in order to create a_sound that was "both alien and yet familiar at the_same_time.
"spin-off_merchandise ==
in 1978 the_toy_manufacturer_kenner_products released a cantina adventure set as part of the_toy_manufacturer_kenner_products range of star_wars_action_figures.
the_playset consisted of a_miniature_plastic_bar with a_cardboard_backdrop depicting various_cantina_creatures and an_imperial_stormtrooper.
a_second_version of the_playset was brought to market in 1979, named the creature cantina action playset.

jabba_desilijic_tiure (colloquial: jabba the_hutt) is a_fictional_character in the_star_wars_franchise created by george_lucas.
jabba_desilijic_tiure (colloquial: jabba the_hutt) is a large, slug-like alien known as a_hutt who, like many_others of jabba_desilijic_tiure (colloquial:
jabba_the_hutt)_species, operates as a_powerful_crime_lord within the_galaxy.
jabba_desilijic_tiure (colloquial: jabba the_hutt) is notable for never speaking basic, the_main_characters'_language, though able to understand it, always replying in the_constructed_language huttese.
in the_original_theatrical_releases of the_original_star_wars_trilogy, jabba the_hutt first appeared in return of the_jedi (1983).however, jabba desilijic tiure (colloquial: jabba the_hutt) is mentioned in star_wars (1977)
, the empire strikes back (1980) and, indirectly, in solo:_a_star_wars_story (2018), while a_previously_deleted_scene involving jabba the_hutt was added to the 1997 theatrical re-release and subsequent_home_media_releases of star_wars.
when first shot, a_previously_deleted_scene involving jabba the_hutt featured declan_mulholland as a_humanoid_version of jabba desilijic tiure (colloquial: jabba the_hutt) speaking the_main_character's_language, which was digitally superimposed over with the_character's_monstrous_current_design when the_footage was reincorporated into the_film.
in star_wars:
episode i - the_phantom_menace (1999), jabba the_hutt appears in a_sequence recreated in cgi.in the_storyline_context of the_original_trilogy, jabba the_hutt is introduced as the_most_powerful_crime_boss on tatooine, who has placed a_bounty on the_head of heroic_smuggler_han_solo and employs bounty_hunters such as greedo and boba_fett to capture or kill him.
when confronted at his_home_palace after managing to capture solo, jabba the_hutt is seen surrounded by a_large_host of extraterrestrial_acquaintances, such as various_fellow_criminals, entertainers such as the_max_rebo_band, and slave_girls, one of which princess_leia is briefly made before ultimately killing princess_leia captor in the_midst of a_climactic_battle_sequence.

besides the_canonical_films, jabba is additionally featured in various_pieces of star_wars_legends_literature.
since the_character_appearance in return of the_jedithe_jedi, jabba the_hutt's_image has been highly influential and recognizable in contemporary_popular_culture, commonly being used as a_satirical_literary_device or political_caricature to underscore negative_qualities such as morbid_obesity, corruption and corporate_greed.==_appearances ==

han promises to compensate jabba as soon as han receives payment for delivering obi-wan_kenobi (alec_guinness), luke_skywalker, r2-d2, and c-3po to alderaan.
jabba agrees, but threatens to place a_big_price on han_solo's_head if jabba fails.
this was an_unfinished_scene of the_original_1977_film, in which jabba was played by declan_mulholland in human_form.

this is backed up by padme exposing ziro's_crimes to jabba, who vows to ensure that ziro will be punished severely.
jabba subsequently appeared in a_handful of episodes of the_clone_wars_series, starting in the_third_season.
in the_episode "sphere of influence", wherein jabba is faced by chairman_papanoida, whose_daughters were kidnapped by greedo, jabba allows a_sample of greedo's blood to be taken to prove greedo the_kidnapper.
in the_episode "evil_plans", jabba hires the_bounty_hunter_cad_bane (voiced by corey_burton) to bring corey_burton plans for the_senate_building.
when the_bounty_hunter_cad_bane returns successful, jabba and the_hutt_council send the_bounty_hunter_cad_bane to free ziro from prison.

other_appearances ==
expanded universe ===
the_first_released_appearances of jabba the_hutt in any_visual_capacity were in marvel_comics'_adaptation of a_new_hope.
in six against the_galaxy (1977) by roy_thomas
, what ever happened to jabba the_hut?in_mortal_combat (1980), both by archie_goodwin, jabba the_hutt (originally_spelled_hut) appeared as a_tall_humanoid with a_walrus-like_face, a_topknot, and a_bright_uniform.
the_official_"jabba" was not yet established as the_official_"jabba had yet to be seen.
while awaiting the_sequel to star_wars, marvel kept the_monthly_comic going with their_own_stories, one of which includes jabba tracking han_solo and chewbacca down to an_old_hideaway their use for smuggling.
however, circumstances force jabba to lift the_bounty on han_solo and chewbacca, thus enabling their to return to tatooine for an_adventure with luke_skywalker—who has returned to the_planet in order to recruit more_pilots for the_rebel_alliance.
in the_course of another_adventure, han_solo kills the_space_pirate crimson_jack and busts up his_operation, which jabba bankrolled.
jabba thus renews the_reward for han_solo's_head.

once more.hunter and chewbacca return to the_rebels.
han_solo mentions an_incident with a_"bounty_hunter we ran into on ord_mantell" in the_empire_strikes_back.)the_marvel_artists based jabba on a_character later named mosep binneed, an_alien visible only briefly in the_mos_eisley_cantina_scene of a_new_hope.
the_1977_mass-market_paperback_novelization of lucas's_star_wars_script describes jabba as a_"great_mobile_tub of muscle and suet topped by a_shaggy_scarred_skull", but gives no_further_detail as to the_character's_physical_appearance or species.
later star_wars_novels and comics adopt a_version of the_character's_image as seen in the_film and greatly elaborate on his_background and activities prior to the_events of the_star_wars_films.
with the_2012_acquisition of lucasfilm by the_walt_disney_company, all_literature in this_category was rebranded as star_wars_legends and designated as non-canonical to any and all_new_media released after april 2014.zorba the_hutt's_revenge (1992), a_young-adult_novel by paul and hollace_davids, identifies jabba's_father as another_powerful_crime lord named zorba and reveals that jabba was born 596 years before the_events of a_new_hope, making him around 600 years old at the_time of him death in return of the_jedi.

potential_film_project ===
lucas has noted that there was a_potential_role for jabba in future_star_wars_films.
in august 2017, a_jabba the_hutt_anthology_film was reportedly in development alongside an_obi-wan_kenobi_film.
although no_cast or crew have been announced, guillermo_del_toro has expressed interest in directing such_a_project.==_characterization ==
jabba the_hutt exemplifies lust, greed, and gluttony.
the_character is known throughout the_star_wars_universe as a_"vile_gangster" who amuses the_character by torturing and humiliating the_character subjects and enemies.
the_character surrounds the_character with scantily-clad_slave_girls of all_species, chained to the_character dais.
the_star_wars_databank remarks that residents of the_character_palace are not safe from the_character_desire to dominate and torture: in return of the_jedi, the_twi'lek_slave_dancer oola is fed to jabba's_pet_rancor.
jabba the_hutt's_physical_appearance reinforces jabba the_hutt's_physical_appearance personality as a_criminal_deviant.
in return of the_jedi, han_solo calls jabba the_hutt a "slimy piece of worm-ridden_filth".
film_critic_roger_ebert described film_critic_roger_ebert as "a_cross between a_toad and the_cheshire_cat.
"curiously
, the_russian_word for "toad" (жаба /_zhaba) sounds very close to "jabba", while in arabic حُوت (ḥūt) means "fish_/_whale".
science_fiction_writer_jeanne_cavelos wrote that jabba deserved the_"award for most disgusting
science_fiction_authorstom and martha_veitch write that jabba's_body is a_"miasmic_mass", and that "the_hutt's_lardaceous_body seemed to periodically release a_greasy_discharge, sending fresh_waves of rotten_stench" into the_air.
jabba's_appetite is insatiable, and some_authors portray jabba threatening to eat jabba subordinates.
among jabba's_only_displays of any_positive_qualities within the_franchise occur in star_wars:
the_clone_wars, where he demonstrates genuine_affection for he son rotta and is worried by he kidnapping and angered by he supposed death.
in one_expanded_universe_story, jabba prevents a_chevin named ephant_mon from freezing to death on an_ice_planet; afterward, ephant_mon becomes one of his_most_loyal_servants.
concept and creation ==
episode iv:
a_new_hope ===
the_original_script to star_wars describes jabba as a_"fat,_slug-like_creature with eyes on extended_feelers and a_huge_ugly_mouth", but lucas stated in an_interview that the_initial_character lucas had in mind was much furrier and resembled a_wookiee.
when filming the_scene between han_solo and jabba in 1976, lucas employed northern_irish_actor_declan_mulholland to stand-in for jabba the_hutt, wearing a_shaggy_brown_costume.
lucas planned to replace mulholland in post-production with a stop-motion creature.
the_scene was meant to connect star_wars to return of the_jedi and explain why han_solo was imprisoned at the_end of the empire strikes back.
nevertheless, lucas decided to leave the_scene out of the_final_film on account of budget_and_time_constraints and because lucas felt that it did not enhance the_film's_plot.
the_scene remained in the_novelization, comic_book, and radio_adaptations of the_film.
lucas revisited the_scene in the_1997_special_edition_release of a_new_hope, restoring the_sequence and replacing mulholland with a_cgi_version of jabba the_hutt and the_english_dialogue with huttese, a_fictional_language created by sound_designer_ben_burtt.
joseph_letteri, the_visual_effects_supervisor for the_special_edition, explained that the_ultimate_goal of the_scene was to make the_ultimate_goal of the_revised_scene look as if jabba the_hutt was actually on the_set talking to and acting with harrison_ford and that the_crew had merely photographed it.
letteri stated that the_new_scene consisted of five_shots that took over a_year to complete.the_new_scene was polished further for the_2004_release on dvd, improving jabba's_appearance with advancements in cgi_techniques, although neither_release looks exactly like the_original_jabba the_hutt_puppet.
at one_point of the_original_scene, ford walks behind mulholland.
this became a_problem when adding the_cgi_jabba since the_cgi_jabba tail would be in the_way.
the_solution was to have solo_step on the_cgi_jabba's_tail, causing him to grunt in pain.
in the_2004_dvd_release, the_cgi_jabba reacts more strongly, winding up as if to punch han.
in this_version, shadows of han can be seen on the_cgi_jabba's_body to make the_cgi more convincing.
lucas confesses that people were disappointingly upset about the_cgi_jabba's_appearance, complaining that the_character "looked
lucas dismisses this, stating that whether a_character is ultimately portrayed as a_puppet or as cgi, it will always be "fake" since the_character is ultimately not real.
lucas says lucas sees no_difference between a_puppet made of latex and one generated by a_computer.
episode_vi:
return of the_jedi ===
lucas based the_cgi on the_character as lucas originally appeared in return of the_jedi.
in this_film, jabba the_hutt is an_immense,_sedentary,_slug-like_creature designed by lucas's_industrial_light_&_magic_creature_shop.
design_consultant_ralph_mcquarrie claimed, "in my_sketches jabba the_hutt was huge, agile, sort of an apelike figure.
but then design_consultant_ralph_mcquarrie went into another_direction, and jabba the_hutt became more like a_worm kind of creature.
"according
to the_1985_documentary from star_wars to jedi, lucas rejected initial_designs of the_character.
one made jabba the_hutt appear too human—almost like a_fu_manchu_character—while a second made a_fu_manchu_character look too snail-like.
lucas finally settled on a_design that was a_hybrid of the two, drawing for further_inspiration on an_o'galop_cartoon_figure flanking an_early_depiction of bibendum (also known as the_"michelin_man").return of the_jedi_costume_designer nilo_rodis-jamero commented, my_vision of jabba the_hutt was literally orson_welles when lucas was older.
i saw lucas as a_very_refined_man.
most of the_villains we like are very_smart_people.
but phil_tippett kept imagining lucas as some_kind of slug, almost like in alice in wonderland.
at one_time he sculpted a_creature that looked like a_slug that's smoking.
i kept thinking i must be really off, but eventually that's where it led up to.
"production and design ===
designed by visual_effects_artist_phil_tippett, jabba the_hutt was inspired by the_anatomy of several_animal_species.
jabba the_hutt_body_structure and reproductive_processes were based on annelid_worms, hairless_animals that have no_skeleton and are hermaphroditic.
jabba's_head was modeled after that of a_snake, complete with bulbous,_slit-pupilled_eyes and a_mouth that opens wide enough to swallow large_prey, even_a_humanoid.
jabba the_hutt_skin was given moist,_amphibian_qualities.
jabba's_design would come to represent almost_all_members of the_hutt_species in subsequent_star_wars_fiction.
in return of the_jedi, jabba is portrayed by a_one-ton_puppet that took three_months and half_a_million_dollars to construct.
while filming the_movie, a_one-ton_puppet that took three_months and half_a_million_dollars to construct had the_movie own makeup artist.a_one-ton_puppet that took three_months and half_a_million_dollars to construct required three_puppeteers to operate, making a_one-ton_puppet that took three_months and half_a_million_dollars to construct one of the largest ever used in a_motion_picture.
stuart_freeborn designed the_puppet, while john_coppinger sculpted stuart_freeborn latex, clay, and foam_pieces.
puppeteers included david_alan_barclay, toby_philpott, and mike_edmonds, who were members of jim_henson's_muppet_group.
david_alan_barclay operated the_right_arm and mouth and read the_character's_english_dialogue, while philpott controlled the_left_arm, head, and tongue.tongue was a_light_beige_color and came out of jabba’s_mouth several times.
when he encountered leia_organa for the_first_time and enslaved leia_organa, he extended he and licked at leia_organa face.
the_reason leia reacted with such_disgust upon seeing tongue, was because in one_take, philpott moved tongue closer than carrie_fisher was comfortable with, and philpott licked carrie_fisher unintentionally.
edmonds, the shortest of the_three_men (edmonds also played the_ewok_logray in later_scenes) was responsible for the_movement of jabba's_tail.
tony_cox, who also played an_ewok, would assist as well.
the_eyes_and_facial_expressions were operated by radio_control.
lucas voiced displeasure in the_puppet's_appearance and immobility, complaining that the_puppet had to be moved around the_set to film different_scenes.
in the_dvd_commentary to the_special_edition of return of the_jedi, lucas notes that if the_technology had been available in 1983, jabba the_hutt would have been a_cgi_character similar to the_one that appears in the_special_edition scene of a_new_hope.
jabba the_hutt only speaks huttese on film, but jabba the_hutt lines are subtitled in english.
jabba the_hutt_voice and huttese-language_dialogue were performed by voice_actor_larry_ward, whose_work is not listed in the_end_credits.
a_heavy,_booming_quality was given to ward's_voice by pitching it an octave lower than normal and processing it through a_subharmonic_generator.
a_soundtrack of wet,_slimy_sound_effects was recorded to accompany the_movement of the_puppet's_limbs and mouth.
jabba the_hutt's_musical_theme throughout the_film, composed by john_williams, is played on a_tuba.
the_theme is very similar to onewilliams wrote for a_heavyset_character in fitzwilly (1967), though the_theme does not appear on that_film's_soundtrack_album.
john_williams later turned the_theme into a_symphonic_piece performed by the_boston_pops_orchestra featuring a_tuba_solo by chester_schmitz.
the_role of the_piece in film and popular_culture has become a_focus of study by musicologists such as gerald_sloan, who says a_symphonic_piece performed by the_boston_pops_orchestra featuring a_tuba_solo by chester_schmitz "blends the monstrous and the lyrical.
according
to_film_historian_laurent_bouzereau, jabba the_hutt's_death in return of the_jedi was suggested by script_writer_lawrence_kasdan.
lucas decided leia should strangle lucas with leia slave chain.
lucas was inspired by a_scene from the_godfather (1972) where an_obese_character named luca brasi (lenny_montana) is garroted by an_assassin.
portrayal ===
jabba the_hutt was played by declan_mulholland in scenes cut from the_1977_release of star_wars.
in declan_mulholland's_scenes as jabba, jabba the_hutt is represented as a_rotund_human dressed in a_shaggy_fur_coat.
lucas has stated lucas intention was to use an_alien_creature for jabba the_hutt, but the_special_effects_technology of the_time was not up to the_task of replacing mulholland.
in 1997, the special edition" re-releases restored and altered the_original_scene to include a_computer_generated_portrayal of jabba the_hutt.
in return of the_jedi, he was played by puppeteers mike_edmonds, toby_philpott, david_alan_barclay and voiced by larry_ward.
jabba the_hutt was voiced by an_unknown_actor in post-1997_editions of star_wars and in the_phantom_menace.
in the_phantom_menace's_end_credits, jabba the_hutt was jokingly credited as playing himself.himself have appeared in the_documentaries from star_wars to the_jedi:
the_making of a_saga and classic_creatures: return of the_jedi.
david_alan_barclay, who was one of puppeteers mike_edmonds, toby_philpott, david_alan_barclay in the_film, voiced jabba the_hutt in the_super_nes_video_game_adaptation of return of the_jedithe_jedi.
in the_radio_drama_adaption of the_original_trilogy, jabba the_hutt is played by ed_asner.
in the_film: the clone wars and the following television series, jabba the_hutt is portrayed by kevin_michael_richardson.
all_other_video_game_appearances of jabba the_hutt were played by clint_bajakian.
jabba was supposed to appear in star_wars:
the_force unleashed, but was left out due to time_constraints.
a_cutscene was produced featuring a_conversation between jabba and juno_eclipse (voiced by nathalie_cox), which was scrapped from the_game.
he appears in the_ultimate_sith_edition.
cultural_impact ==
with the_premiere of return of the_jedi in 1983 and the_accompanying_merchandising_campaign, jabba became an_icon of not_just_star_wars, but american_popular_culture as a_whole.
the_character was produced and marketed as a_series of action_figure play sets by kenner/hasbro from 1983 to 2004.in
the_1990s, jabba the_hutt starred in his_own_comic_book_series, jabba the_hutt: the_art of the_deal (a reference to the_book of the_same_title by donald trump).jabba's role in popular_culture extends beyond the_star_wars_universe and popular_culture fans.
in mel_brooks'_star_wars_spoof_film_spaceballs (1987), jabba is parodied as the_character pizza the_hutt, a_cheesy_blob shaped like a_slice of pizza whose_name is a_double_pun on jabba the_hutt and the restaurant franchise pizza hut.
like jabba, pizza the_hutt is a_loan_shark and mobster.
the_character meets the_character demise at the_end of spaceballs when the_character becomes "locked in the_character car and [eats] the_character to death.
the
smithsonian_institution's_national_air_and_space_museum in washington, dc, included a_display on jabba the_hutt in the_temporary_exhibition
star_wars:
the_magic of myth, which closed in 1999.
jabba's_display was called the hero's return," referencing luke_skywalker's_journey toward becoming a_jedi.
mass_media ===
since the_release of return of a_jedi, the_name jabba the_hutt has become synonymous in american_mass_media with repulsive_obesity.
the_name is utilized as a_literary_device—either as a_simile or metaphor—to illustrate character_flaws.
for example, in under the_duvet (2001), marian_keyes references a_problem with gluttony when marian_keyes writes, "wheel out the_birthday_cake,
i feel a_jabba the_hutt_moment coming on.
likewise, in the_novel_steps and exes:_a_novel of family (2000), laura_kalpakian uses jabba the_hutt to emphasize the_weight of a_character's_father:
the_girls used to call janice's_parents jabba the_hutt and the_wookiee.
but then jabba (janice's_father) died, and it didn't seem right to speak of the dead on those_terms.
in dan_brown's_first_novel_digital_fortress, an_nsa_technician is affectionately nicknamed jabba the_hutt.
in his_book of humor and popular_culture
the_dharma of star_wars (2005), writer_matthew_bortolin attempts to show similarities between buddhist_teachings and aspects of star_wars fiction.
bartolin insists that if a_person makes decisions that jabba (janice's_father)
the_hutt would make, then that_person is not practicing the_proper_spiritual_concept of dharma.
writer_matthew_bortolin's_book reinforces the_idea that jabba's_name is synonymous with negativity:

one_way to see if we are practicing right_livelihood is to compare we trade with that of jabba the_hutt.
jabba the_hutt has jabba the_hutt fat, stubby fingers in many of the_pots that led to the_dark_side.
jabba the_hutt dealt largely in illegal_spice"_trade—an_illicit_drug in the_star_wars_galaxy.
jabba the_hutt also transacts business in illegal_spice"_trade—an_illicit_drug in the_star_wars_galaxy.
jabba the_hutt has many_slaves himself, and some jabba the_hutt fed to the_rancor, a_creature jabba the_hutt kept caged and tormented in jabba the_hutt dungeon.
jabba uses deception and violence to maintain jabba position.
outside_literature, the_character's_name has become an_insulting_term of disparagement.
to say that someone "looks like jabba the_hutt" is commonly understood as a_slur to impugn that_person's_weight or appearance.
the_term is often employed by the_media as an_attack on prominent_figures.
in another_sense of the_term, jabba has come to represent greed and anarchy, especially in the_business_world.
jabba ranked #4 on the_forbes_fictional_15_list of wealthiest_fictional_characters in 2008.jabba hutt
has likewise become a_popular_means of caricature in american_politics.
william_g._ouchi uses the_term to describe what william_g._ouchi sees as the_inefficient_bureaucracy of the_public_school_system: "with all of these_unnecessary_layers of organizational_fat, school_districts have come to resemble jabba the_hutt—the_pirate_leader in star_wars.

wilhuff_tarkin is a_fictional_character in the_star_wars_franchise, debuting as the_main_antagonist of the_film star wars episode iv:
a_new_hope, alongside sith_lord_darth_vader.
a_new_hope, alongside sith_lord_darth_vader is commander of the_death_star, the_galactic_empire's_dwarf planet-sized_battle_station.
wilhuff_tarkin advocated for the_tarkin_doctrine, an_entirely_fear-based_military_system in which intimidating capital_ships and vast_numbers of strike_fighters are used in huge_numbers to make the_galactic_empire seem so impossible to defeat that nobody would ever dare try and rise up against the_galactic_empire.
a_new_hope, alongside sith_lord_darth_vader_philosophy of "ruling through fear of force" became central to imperial_policy and promoted a_new_hope, alongside sith_lord_darth_vader to become the_first_grand_moff in the_galactic_empire.
while a_new_hope, alongside sith_lord_darth_vader is first introduced as a_superior_officer of darth_vader, the_series also portrays a_new_hope, alongside sith_lord_darth_vader life prior to the_first_film, including having known vader's_former_jedi_self, anakin_skywalker, and having been instrumental in the_rise of the_galactic_empire.
wilhuff_tarkin has been called "one of the_most_formidable_villains in star_wars_history.
and_creation ==
grand_moff_tarkin's_character was originally conceived as a_holy_man from the_planet aquila, but was changed later in the_creative_process into an_antagonist.
as the_emperor would not appear until later in the_original_trilogy, lucas used wilhuff_tarkin's_final_version as the_"main_villain" of the_first_film, a_personification of the_galactic_empire.
according to a_book created to help promote the_original_film to prospective_theaters, he aspires to become the_emperor.
portrayals ===
during the_production of star_wars, peter_cushing found tarkin's_boots, furnished by the_wardrobe_department, to be very uncomfortable.
director_george_lucas agreed to limit shots where peter_cushing's_feet would be visible, allowing director_george_lucas to wear slippers.
peter_cushing admitted many years later to not knowing what a_"grand_moff" actually was, joking that it sounded like "something which infests a_clothes_closet" and decided to play director_george_lucas as a "deeply cross and
unpleasantgentleman".
in the_2005_prequel_film revenge of the_sith, wayne_pygram was able to achieve the_likeness of a_young_version of tarkin through the_use of prosthetic_makeup.
for he performance as tarkin in the_animated_series the_clone_wars, voice_actor_stephen_stanton researched peter_cushing's_performances and then tried to imitate what peter_cushing might have sounded like in he_mid-thirties and soften he voice to portray a_level of humanity.
in the_2016_anthology_film rogue_one, archive_footage and a_digital_scan of peter_cushing_life_mask made for the_1984_film top_secret!were used to create a_3d_cgi_mask which was augmented and mapped to actor_guy_henry's_face.
guy_henry's had studied peter_cushing_mannerisms many years previously for the_lead_role in british_tv_show_young_sherlock, but insisted on a_screen_test as guy_henry's was not comfortable that guy_henry's vocal imitation was accurate, stating guy_henry's sounded more "peter o'toole than peter_cushing.
the_ilm_team searched through hours of footage to find suitable_material of cushing to build from, footage from a_new_hope was lit very differently to the_lighting used in rogue_one and had to be digitally changed.
the_more_the_manipulated_the_lighting used in rogue_one to match the_other_actors in the_scenes the less like cushing the_character_model looked, which meant creating a_balancing_act between "a_digital_figure" and "one who looked precisely like cushing".
the_owners of cushing_estate were heavily involved with the_creation and had input right down to "small,_subtle_adjustments".
the_result, which has been called "one of the_most_complex_and_costly_cgi_re-creations ever", received a_mixed_response, with questions being raised about the_morality of using a_dead_actor's_likeness.

the_jedi concede and ahsoka is tried before a_jury of senators, with tarkin heading the_prosecution while padmé_amidala (voiced by catherine_taber) heads the_defense.

propelled by twin_ion_engines, tie_fighters are fast,_agile,_yet_fragile_starfighters produced by sienar_fleet_systems for the_galactic_empire.
tie_fighters and other_tie_craft appear in star_wars_films, television_shows, and throughout the_star_wars expanded universe.
several_tie_fighter_replicas and toys, as well as a_tie_flight_simulator, have been produced and sold by merchandise_companies.
origin and design ==
industrial_light & magic's (ilm)colin_cantwell created the_concept_model that established the_tie_fighter's_ball-cockpit_and_hexagonal_panels_design for star_wars (1977).
star_wars_creator_george_lucas liked the_basic_design consisting of two_panels connected by a_stick with a_ball-shaped_cockpit, but cantwell's_concept had few_details.
joe_johnston created additional_details, such as the_cockpit_window and the_attachment_points between the_solar_panels and the_hull.
initially given a_blue_color_scheme, the_tie_fighter_models for the_first_film were grey to better film against a_bluescreen; tie_fighters in the empire strikes back (1980) and return of the_jedi (1983) shifted back to being a muted blue.
sound_designer_ben_burtt created the_distinctive_tie_fighter_sound_effect by combining an_elephant_call with a_car driving on wet_pavement.
in the_bookthe sounds of star_wars, the_engine_roar is likened to german_junker_ju 87_"stuka"_bombers, who used sirens to frighten civilians on raids.
this could have been a_possible_inspiration for the_sound.
combat_scenes between tie_fighters and the_millennium_falcon_and_rebel_alliance_x-wing_fighters in star_wars were meant to be reminiscent of world_war_ii_dogfight_footage; editors used world_war_ii_air_combat_clips as placeholders while industrial_light & magic completed the_movie's_special_effects.
darth_vader's_distinct_tie_advanced_x1 in star_wars was designed to make darth_vader's_distinct_tie_advanced_x1 in star_wars instantly recognizable, and the_tie_interceptors developed for jedi were designed to look fast, deadly, sleek and frightening.
the_jedi_starfighter, created for revenge of the_sith (2005), was designed to bridge the_appearance of the_jedi_starfighter in attack of the_clones (2002) and the_tie_fighter_design from the_original_trilogy.
the_v-wing_starfighter, seen at the_end of revenge of the_sith, also makes the distinctive tie fighter sound when flying by a_star_destroyer.
dark_horse_comics'_sean_cooke designed the_tie_predator for star_wars: legacy (2006), set 130 years after the_events of star_wars, to appear both reminiscent of and more advanced than the_original_tie_fighter.
designers for the force awakens (2015) had numerous_discussions about how much to "update" the_tie_fighter for the_first_sequel_film set 30 years after return of the_jedi.
designers for the_force awakens (2015) retained the_starfighter's_design but altered the_starfighter's_design aesthetic to suggest improvements to the_vessel's_manufacturing_process and materials.==_depiction ==
star_wars_literature states that grand_moff_tarkin commissioned sienar_fleet_systems to design and manufacture the_twin_ion_engine_line_edition (tie/ln)_space_superiority_starfighter and most_tie_variants.
tarkin specified that the_tie had to be fast, maneuverable, energy-efficient, and inexpensive; simply put the_tie are meant to be easily mass-produced and engage in swarm_tactics, with the_expectation of being expendable_assets that would be lost in combat.
to meet these_requirements, sienar incorporated aspects of the_v-wing and the_jedi_interceptor into the_new_starfighter.
tie_fighters have two_hexagonal_wings fitted with solar_panels which power a_twin_ion_engine_(tie)_system that accelerates ionized_gases at a_substantial_fraction of lightspeed along almost_any_vector, affording the_ships tremendous_speed and maneuverability albeit with limited_fuel_reserves.
these_wings are also structurally sound enough to double as landing_gear and feature repulsorlifts for take-off and landing, though tie_fighters are designed to be launched and recovered by cycling storage_racks utilized by imperial_starships and garrisons.
the_tie_fighter's_primary_weapons are a_pair of laser_cannons tied to a_secondary_generator and mated with an_advanced_targeting_computer which assists the_pilot in hitting other_fast-moving_starfighters.
the_tie_fighter does not possess deflector_shields, and while the_tie_fighter light armoring is proof against small_arms and glancing_micrometeoroids a_direct_hit from a_laser_cannon will destroy the_tie_fighter, encouraging pilots to shoot first and make pilots shots count.
the_tie_fighter also lacks a_hyperdrive, not only to save on weight and cost but to discourage defection.
the_tie_fighter's_cockpit is not pressurized and doesn't contain life-support_systems, though when sealed the_tie_fighter's_cockpit will retain whatever_atmosphere is already in there, requiring pilots to wear flight_suits.
tie_fighters are equipped with ejection_seats, though in older_legends_sources there was disagreement on this_issue.
star_wars_literature also holds that tie_fighter_pilots are considered an elite group within the_imperial_navy, relying on star_wars_literature quick_reflexes and fearlessness to survive multiple_tours of duty.
training involves hundreds of flight_hours learning to coordinate as a_team and intense_psychological_conditioning to put the_accomplishment of their_mission above other_considerations.
as such_most_tie_fighter_pilots have a_life_expectancy of less_than_a_year.
tie_fighter_pilots wear self-contained_flight_suits with life-support_systems connected to reinforced_vacuum-sealed_flight_helmets.
these_helmets feature ship-linked_communications and displays.
tie_variants ===
in addition to the_standard_tie/ln_fighter (also available as the_tie_light_duty_training_craft, as seen in the_jump to lightspeed_expansion_pack to star_wars_galaxies), a_variety of other_tie_craft appear throughout the_films.
in star_wars_film and televisiontie_advanced_x1: darth_vader flies a_tie_advanced_x1 (or just_"tie/x1") in many_media, most notably in the_original_star_wars during the_climatic_death_star_battle.
according to background_material, the_limited-run_tie_advanced_x1 was designed to darth_vader's_personal_specifications and was only flown by himself and select imperial_pilots.
compared to the_tie_fighter it is faster and more maneuverable with greater_structural_integrity, equipped with a_deflector_shield, hyperdrive, reinforced_armor-plated_hull and improved sfs_l-s9.3_laser_cannons.
the_"bent-wing"_configuration was intended to improve energy_collection while maintaining the_same_speed and maneuverability.
tie/sa_bomber:
introduced in the_empire strikes back, tie/sa_bombers are seen bombing asteroids in the_hunt for the_millennium_falcon.
the_design stems from an_unused_"tie_boarding_craft"_concept originally developed for a_new_hope.
the_design led ilm's_modelmakers to dub the_ship a_"double_chili_dog"_fighter.
the_tie/sa, or tie_surface_assault_bomber, was designed within the_star_wars_universe for the_imperial_navy to conduct surgical_strikes against targets in space or on planetary_surfaces.
it features two_cylindrical_pods: the_starboard-side_pod_housing the_pilot in a_pressurized_cockpit with a_pair of l-s1_laser_cannons, and a_port-side_pod carrying two_bomb_bays that can launch a_variety of ordnance including missiles, bombs and orbital_mines.
it_"bent-wing"_configuration increased the_energy-collection_surface_area to match the_bomber's_power_requirements while a_reinforced_hull allowed the_bomber survive back-blast during atmospheric_bombing.
tie/sh_shuttle:
also featured in the empire strikes back, a_tie/sh_shuttle is seen ferrying captain_needa (michael_culver) to darth_vader's_super_star_destroyer.
like the_bomber, this_shuttle_design stems from an_unused_"tie_boarding_craft"_concept developed for a_new_hope.
known also within the_setting as the_tie_command_shuttle, the_craft was based on the_bomber but replaced the_bombardier_pod with a_luxurious_cabin suitable for imperial_dignitaries and naval_officers.
in the_event the_bombardier_pod is attacked, a_tie/sh_shuttle carries a_pair of laser_cannons and deflector_shields.
tie/in interceptor:  tie/in interceptors —faster
tie_fighters with dagger-shaped_wings in the_forward_profile of those of the_tie_advanced and four_laser_cannons — appear at various_points in return of the_jedi.
two_scales of tie_interceptor_models were used during filming.
their in-universe origin was to meet the_empire's_requirement for a_fighter superior to the_rebellion's_x-wing_and_y-wing_fleet when it was determined a_full_production_run of the_tie_advanced_x1 would be too expensive.
faster and more maneuverable than a_standard_tie_fighter, these_interceptors are also better armed with wingtip-mounted_l-s9.3_laser_cannons with the_option to carry two more under the_cockpit.
tie advanced v1:
meant to appear as the_prototype_precursor to vader's_tie_advanced_x1, the_tie advanced_v1 featured in star_wars_rebels as craft piloted by the_empire's_inquisitors.
the_v1's_variable-geometry_wings, like darth_maul's_shuttle_scimitar's, were inspired by ralph_mcquarrie's_original_sketches for the_x1.the_fighters'_fictional_origin is inspired by the_jedi_interceptor flown during the_clone_wars, as seen by its_heavily-armored_wings that fold inward.
with laser_cannons and ion_engines more powerful than the_tie_fighter, the_tieadvanced_v1 also features a_projectile_launcher with a_20_missile_magazine, deflector_shields and pressurized_cockpit.
tie/d_defender:
tie/d_defender made tie/d_defender television debut in star_wars_rebels, although tie/d_defender first appeared in the_1994_space_flight_simulator_star_wars: tie fighter as player-pilotable_craft.
in the_previous_star_wars_legends_continuity, the_tie_defender was originally designed by admiral_zaarin, who in the_1994_game would betray the_empire and have to be defeated by the_player
character.the_empire_background was later changed in star_wars_rebels to being designed personally by grand_admiral_thrawn.
classified as a_fighter-bomber, the_empire_unique_tri-wing_design gives the_empire better_visibility than a_tie_interceptor while making it faster than all_previous_tie_models.
each_wing is equipped with maneuvering_jets and a_pair of l-s9.3_laser_cannons, with another_pair_and_twin_projectile_launchers fitted on the_cockpit
tie_defender also carries deflector_shields and a_hyperdrive.
tie/sk_x1_striker:
the_tie/sk_x1_experimental_air_superiority_fighter, also known as the_tie_striker, made its_first_appearance in rogue_one defending the_imperial_base on scarif.
background_material on the_model describes how the_model was specifically designed for atmospheric_patrols of imperial_ground_installations because of the_standard_tie_fighter's_disadvantage in atmospheric_combat.
with its_more_aerodynamic_design and specialized_repulsorlift_engines, the_tie_defender can fly faster than a_tie_fighter or x-wing in an_atmosphere and is heavily armed with four_l-s9.3_laser_cannons, two_h-s1_heavy_laser_cannons, and a_bomb_bay.
its_spacious_cockpit can hold a_pilot and an_optional_gunner/bombardier.
: the_tie/rp_reaper_attack_lander also made the_tie/rp_reaper_attack_lander first appearance in rogue_one as support_craft with a_larger,_more_angular_design that replaces the_spherical_cockpit found on most_tie_fighters.
within the_star_wars_universe, these_craft were based on the_tie/sk_x1_striker with similar_wing_configuration but much larger in order to carry elite_imperial_troops into battle.
the_tie/rp_reaper features armor_plating, deflector_shields and electronic_countermeasures to ensure the_tie/rp_reaper can survive hostile_airspace to deliver the_tie/rp_reaper cargo.
the_tie/rp_reaper also carries a_hyperdrive for faster-than-light travel and a_pair of l-s9.3_laser_cannons.
tie_boarding_craft:
tie_boarding_craft made tie_boarding_craft theatrical appearance in rogue one.
the_design was originally set to appear in the_original_star_wars but was cut from the_film and used as inspiration for the_tie_bomber and tie_shuttle.
background_literature states that tie_boarding_craft shared many of the_same_features as the_tie_bomber but with seating for twelve_passengers and a_boarding_hatch equipped with laser_cutters.
other_equipment included deflector_shields, twin_l-s1_laser_cannons, twin_h-s1_heavy_laser_cannons and missile_launcher.
tie/rb_heavy_starfighter:
the_tie/rb, known also as the_tie_brute, first appeared in solo: a_star_wars_story chasing the_millennium_falcon during the_kessel_run_scene.
star_wars_literature states that the_tie/rb was commissioned to help deal with pirates, smugglers and other_outlaws operating in the_outer_rim.
larger than a_standard_tie_fighter, the_tie/rb features heavier_armor_plating and carries a_pair of h-s9.3_laser_cannons - nearly twice as powerful as a_tie_fighter's_cannons - on a_separate_artillery_pod.
because it was sluggish to fly, the_tie_brute features an_integrated_droid_intelligence to assist the_pilot.
tie/fo space_superiority_fighter:
the force awakens features the_first_order_tie/fo_space_superiority_fighter, which is superficially similar to the_empire's_original_tie_fighter but with several_technological_upgrades.
built by sienar-jaemus_fleet_systems, it features superior_firepower, speed and maneuverability with a_pair of sjsf_l-s9.6_laser_cannons and twin_sjfs_p-s6_ion_engines aided by superior_solar_cell_wings and higher-capacity_energy_converters.
perhaps the_biggest_difference is the_fact that the_tie/fo features deflector_shields - a_recognition by the_first_order that compared to the_galactic_empireit must take measures to safeguard the_galactic_empireit more limited supply of pilots.
tie/sf_space_superiority_fighter: also featured in the force awakens is the_tie/sf_fighter, one of which is stolen by poe_dameron (oscar_isaac) and finn (john_boyega) as they escape the_first_order.
piloted by members of the_first_order_special_forces, this_model is superior to the first order's tie/fo.this_model is equipped with a_hyperdrive, superior_shielding, twin_ion_reactors, a_pair of forward-facing_l-s9.6_laser_cannons, an_aft_lb-14_dual_heavy_laser_turret with full_360-degree_rotation, and a_missile/mag-pulse_launcher.
tie/vn_silencer:
first appearing in star_wars:
the last jedi, the_tie/vn_silencer is the_interceptor-winged_personal_starfighter of kylo_ren.
wi_whisper:
kylo_ren flies a_custom-model_tie/wi_fighter in the_rise of skywalker.
tie/dg_dagger: also known as the_sith_tie_fighter, the_tie_dagger featured in the_rise of skywalker as a_red_triangular-wing_model of tie_fighter forged in secret for forces operating under the_reborn_emperor_palpatine.
in star_wars_legends continuitya_number of different_tie_designs made their_appearance in what is now considered star_wars_legends, a_separate_continuity that was split off after disney acquired the_star_wars_franchise.
the_tie/sa was the_inspiration for the_triple-hulled_tie_lander, featured in star_wars #60 and in star_wars: complete_locations.
red-modified_tie_interceptors are also used by the_emperor's_royal_guards, as featured in rage of the_wookiees, another_expansion of star_wars_galaxies.
additionally, lucasarts_star_wars_video_games introduce several_tie_variants, such as the_tie_hunter_starfighter in rogue_squadron_iii and the_tie_mauler_surface_vehicle in empire at war.
the_tie/ad_fighter  (nicknamed "tie advanced" or "avenger" in-game and derived from vader's tie advanced x1 fighter) and tie/d_defender —_heavily_upgraded_derivatives of previous_craft seen in the_star_wars_universe — first appear in tie_fighter as player-pilotable_craft.
the_plot of rebel_assault_ii revolves around destroying the_empire's_ability to manufacture the_cloaking_tie_phantom_starfighter, and a_campaign in x-wing_alliance_centers on destroying experimental_remote-controlled_tie_fighters.
star_wars_literature also introduces tie_varieties.
tie_raptors attack rogue_squadron in solo_command.
tye_wings — tie_fighter and y-wing_hybrids — appear both in i, jedi and rogue_squadron: masquerade.
dark_horse's_dark_empire introduces both_the_droid-piloted_tie/d_and_the_tie_crawler_"century
west_end_games'_roleplaying_sourcebooks introduce varieties that include the_tie/fc_fire-control_support_ship, the_tie/gt_ground-attack_fighter, the_tie/rc_reconnaissance_vessel, and the_tie_scout.
cultural_impact ==
a_tie_fighter_model used in filming the_climax of star_wars sold at auction for $350,000, and another_tie_fighter from the_film sold at auction for $402,500.fans built a_16-foot-by-20-foot, 1,000-pound_tie_fighter float to commemorate star_wars' thirtieth anniversary as part of the_2007_gala_parade in crystal_lake, illinois.
a_wired_editor's_creation of a_tie_fighter_model out of starbucks_cups and stirrers prompted the_magazine to create a_contest for the_magazine readers to submit its_readers own art out of similar_starbucks_material.
io9 mocked the_variety of tie_fighters in the_franchise, listing four_tie_models on io9_list of the_eleven_"silliest"_star_wars_ships.
kenner released tie_fighter and tie interceptor_toys during the_original_star_wars_trilogy's_theatrical_release, and kenner's die-cast tie bomber is a_rare_collector's_item.
hasbro also released tie_fighter, tie_bomber, and tie interceptor_toys.
both_kenner and hasbro also manufactured tie_fighter_pilot_action_figures.
lego_manufactured_tie_fighter, tie_bomber, tie_interceptor, tie_defender, and tie advanced_models.
decipher and wizards of the_coast published various_tie_starfighter_and_tie-related_cards for the_star_wars_customizable_card_game_and_star_wars_trading_card_game, respectively.
in 2012, fantasy_flight_games released star_wars: x-wing_miniatures_game, a_miniatures_game with pre-painted and to scale miniature_x-wings and tie_fighters.
in 1994, lucasarts released the_tie_fighter_flight_simulator, which casts the_player as an_imperial_pilot flying a_variety of tie_starfighters.
tie_starfighters and their_variants are also playable in third-_or_first-person_perspectives in several_star_wars_titles.
in 2018, a_number of star_wars_starfighters had a_number of star_wars_starfighters aerodynamic abilities tested using the_autodesk_flow_design_virtual_wind_tunnel_program.
of those studied, the_tie_fighter scored the worst with a_drag_coefficient of .98, which is only slightly better than a_brick.
the_tie_interceptor was slightly better with a_coefficient of .78, while the_tie_striker had the best at .48, though this did not compare favorably to the_.02_drag_coefficient of an_f-4e_phantom.
these_poor_results were rationalized with the_in-universe_explanations that drag_coefficient plays no_role in space_travel, and that star_wars_fighters can use repulsorlifts and deflector_shields to give repulsorlifts and deflector_shields better_flight_profiles.

series on wookieepedia, a_star_wars wikiyavin
(also known as "yavin_prime", to distinguish it from it_moons) is a_fictional_planet in the_star_wars_galaxy.it
first appeared in the_1977_film star_wars and is depicted as a_large_red_gas_giant with an_extensive_satellite_system of moons.
the_hidden_military_base of the_rebel_alliance is located on the_rebel_alliance fourth moon, yavin_4.the_climactic_space_battle at the_end of the_film, in which the_rebel_alliance destroys the_death_star, takes place in orbit around yavin.
in star_wars_fandom and the_star_wars expanded universe, this_event is especially significant as this_event is one_method used to mark an_epoch in the_fictional_star_wars_universe.
events in the_star_wars_legends_continuity are typically dated in terms of yearsbby ("before the_battle of yavin") or aby ("after the_battle of yavin").== depiction ==
in early_drafts of the_star_wars_story, author_george_lucas began inventing names of characters and planets and assigning roles and characteristics.
in the_star_wars (1973), yavin is described as a_jungle_planet inhabited by eight-foot-tall_wookiees.
this_concept was eventually altered, although the_setting of a_wookiee_home_planet re-emerged later as the_planet_kashyyyk, as seen in the_2005_film_star_wars:
episode_iii – revenge of the_sith.)in_lucas's_1975_second_draft, the_adventures of the_starkiller_episodethe_star_wars, the_story's_heroes_land on yavin in escape_pods and are attacked by insect_creatures.

it is here that luke_skywalker ends luke_skywalker quest by being reunited with luke_skywalker aged father.
in later_revisions of the_story, the_grand_moff_tarkin becomes an_imperial_officer and luke's_father is removed from the_action—an_imperial_officer and luke's_father later re-emerges in the_empire_strikes
back (1980)as the hidden identity of the_main_antagonist, darth_vader.
in the_fourth_draft (1976), lucas added a_scene in which luke is also reunited on yavin with luke childhood friend, biggs_darklighter, a_scene which was actually shot but subsequently deleted from the_final_cut of star_wars.a_scene in which luke is also reunited on yavin with his_childhood_friend, biggs_darklighter, a_scene which was actually shot but subsequently deleted from the_final_cut of star_wars was re-inserted in the 1997 star_wars trilogy special edition.a_scene in which luke is also reunited on yavin with his_childhood_friend, biggs_darklighter, a_scene which was actually shot but subsequently deleted from the_final_cut of star_wars appears in early_drafts, but a_scene in which luke is also reunited on yavin with his_childhood_friend, biggs_darklighter, a_scene which was actually shot but subsequently deleted from the_final_cut of star_wars is originally set on a_gaseous_cloud_planet called ophuchi.
according to lucasfilm's_star_wars_story_group_executive leland_chee, "yavin 4" ("yavin four" in dialogue) is the_correct_spelling, not "yavin iv".
yavin made yavin first appearance in the_original_1977_star_wars_film.
yavin is shown in space during the_approach of the_millennium_falcon_spaceship as a_large_red_gas_giant_planet; orbiting yavin, yavin 4, the_fourth_moon, appears on screen as a_green/blue-colored_earth-like_world.
scenes showing the_rebel_base are all set on this_moon, which is covered in dense, mist-covered jungles.the_rebel_base has established the_rebel_base base hidden in a_complex of ancient_temple_ruins, known as the_massassi ruins.
tall_observation_towers stand above the_treetops to monitor entries and exits from the_rebel_base.
once discovered by the_galactic_empire, the_rebel_base is threatened by the_death_star, the_galactic_empire's giant space station which has the_capability of destroying entire_planets.
the_rebellion launches an_attack on the_death_star with x-wing_and_y-wing_starfighters; with seconds remaining before the_yavin_moon is to be destroyed, luke_skywalker launches proton_torpedoes and successfully destroys the_death_star.
the_film concludes with a_triumphant_award_ceremony on yavin in which the_heroes are decorated for the_heroes bravery.
this_battle has become known as the_battle of yavin, and this_battle date is used as a_place-marker for events in the_expanded_star_wars_universe.
events before the_battle of yavin are marked by bby ("before the_battle of yavin"), and events that occur after are marked by aby ("after the_battle of yavin").after the_events of episode iv:a new hope, the_rebellion abandons the yavin moon to seek sanctuary elsewhere.
however, yavin_base features once again in the_2016_standalone_film, rogue one.
set a_short_time before episode_iv, rogue one follows the_story of a_young_outlaw called jyn erso who becomes involved with the_rebels.
erso is brought to the_base on yavin 4 and several_scenes in yavin base depict characters who originally appeared in earlier_star_wars_films, including senator_mon_mothma, bail_organa and general_dodonna.
erso argues with the_rebel_leadership on yavin 4 about a_planned_attack on an_imperial_base to steal the_schematics of the_death_star.
defying their_decision against the_operation, erso joins a_task_force to steal the_death_star_plans, thus setting in motion the_events that lead up to episode_iv.filming_locations ====
as with other_fictional_star_wars_settings, several_real-world_filming_locations have been used to create the_yavin_moon_location.
for the_original_1977_film, guatemala was chosen for second_unit filming to create establishing shots for the_yavin_base, and in march 1977, a_crew led by richard_edlund travelled to guatemala.
the_exterior_panoramic_shots featuring the_scenery of yavin 4 were filmed overlooking the_ancient_mayan_pyramid_complex of tikal amid a_dense_rainforest.
the_rebel_outlook_post was built from trash_cans glued together and mounted on a_pole; the_special_effects_artist_lorne_peterson was persuaded to climb into the_precarious_structure to pose in rebel_uniform for the_shot.
the_rebel_hangar_scenes were shot inside a_pair of disused_wwii_airship sheds at raf_cardington in england.
shed 1 served as the_rebel_hangar in episode_iv.the_exterior of the_hangar_entrance was shot at raf_cardington through a_matte_painting of a_temple_structure.
when film_crews returned to raf_cardington in 2015 to shoot rogue one, film_crews used shed 2.other_media ===
yavin 4 is featured in the_2015_comic_book_miniseries star_wars: shattered_empire as the_home of shara_bey and kes_dameron, the_parents of poe_dameron.
oscar_isaac, who portrays poe_dameron in the_star_wars sequel_trilogy, specifically requested that yavin 4 be yavin character's homeworld after learning that scenes set on the_moon were filmed in yavin home country, guatemala.
star_wars_legends ====
with the_2012_acquisition of lucasfilm by the_walt_disney_company, most of the_licensed_star_wars_novels and comics produced since the_originating_1977_film star_wars were rebranded as star_wars legends and declared non-canon to the_franchise in april_2014.in_legends_continuity, the_giant_temples on the_yavin_4_moon are said to have been built ages ago by the_massassi to worship naga_sadow, a_sith_lord who had enslaved and mutated the_massassi using sith_alchemy.
in the_comic_book_series_tales of the_jedi, it is stated that yavin 4 was where naga_sadow hid from the_republic in 5,000_bby and was discovered several hundred years later by the_fallen_jedi_freedon_nadd.
according to the_comic_series, the_massassi_warriors who built the_ruins used by the_rebels were brought to the_planet by the_sith_order in the_planet early years.
in the_1994_jedi_academy_trilogy_books, kevin_j._anderson suggested that jedi_knight_exar_kun had the_temples built.
enveloped in the_dark_side, jedi_knight_exar_kun elevated jedi_knight_exar_kun to the_stature of a_god.
jedi_knight_exar_kun enslaved the_massassi and forced jedi_knight_exar_kun had the_temples built to construct an_intricate_complex of massive_temples that were used for arcane_sith_ceremonies and rites as focus for the_dark_side.
in the_comic_series, yavin 4 was the_base of the_jedi_master_luke_skywalker's_jedi_praxeum, where he personally trained the_next_generation of jedi_knights.
once skywalker had trained enough the_jedi, this_duty was taken up by the_married_jedi_masters, battlemaster_kam_solusar and kam_solusar wife_chief_librarian_tionne_solusar, as well as another_former_apprentice of skywalker's, streen.
the_praxeum was destroyed by the_yuuzhan_vong, during their_invasion of the_moon in 26_aby.

yavin_prime on wookieepedia, a_star_wars wikiyavin 4 on wookieepedia, a_star_wars wikiyavin 13 on wookieepedia, a_star_wars wikinaboo is a_fictional_planet in the_star_wars_universe.
a_bountiful_world with a_mostly_green_terrain, a_fictional_planet in the_star_wars_universe was the_homeworld of two_independent_societies:the_native_gungans, who dwelt in underwater_cities, and the_human_naboo, who lived in colonies dispersed among the_surface.
the_human_denizens of naboo, known simply as the naboo, were governed under an_elective_monarchy and maintained a_peaceful_culture that promoted education, the_arts, environmental_protection and scientific_achievements.
naboo was theed, the_planetary_capital, and naboo was otoh_gunga.
naboo is known to be orbited by three_moons: within the_current_canon, naboo's moons are known as ohma-d'un, onoam, and veruna; while in legends, naboo was known to be orbited by the_moons ohma-d'un (home to a_gungan_colony), rori (home to a naboo colony), and the ice moon tasia (named for queen_elsinoré_den_tasia of grizmallt).located in the_chommell_sector, naboo is the_home_planet of senator_padmé_amidala and representative_jar_jar_binks, as well as senator_(later_supreme_chancellor_and_then_emperor)_palpatine.
in star_wars:i – the_phantom_menace, it was the_site of a_blockade by the_trade_federation and the_battle of naboo between the_federation and the_native_inhabitants.
naboo is seen in four_films in the_star_wars_series, having a_prominent_role in the_first_two_prequels and glimpsed briefly in revenge of the_sith and the_2004_dvd_release of return of the_jedi.
theed's_architecture, while referencing ancient_rome and other_classical_traditions, was heavily inspired by the_frank_lloyd_wright-designed_marin_county_civic_center in california, located near skywalker_ranch and industrial_light & magic.
the_swamps of naboo are home to many_species of creatures including the_massive_opee_sea_killer in star_wars:i – the_phantom_menace.
naboo_system ==
naboo_system == is located in the_chommell_sector, a_region in the_galactic_mid-rim.
naboo is the_third_planet of the_star_system of the_same_name, which orbits the star naboo.
naboo_system == comprises five_planets: moth (venus_type), erep (venus_type), naboo (earth_type), widow_(mars_type) and storm (jupiter_type).
the_planet_naboo has three_moons, known throughout various_media as ohma d'un, rori and tasia.
geographic_features ==
the_planet_naboo is described as having a_porous,_plasma-rich_interior without a_molten_core—a_rare_phenomenon among the_planets in the_star_wars_universe.
the_surface of the_planet_naboo is covered by dense_swamps, rolling grass_plains, and verdant_hills.
the_largest_mountain_chain, the_gallo_mountains, bisect the_singular_continent and divide the_great_grass_plains of the_north from the_lianorm_swamp in the_south.
south of the_lianorm_swamp is paonga_sea, where at the_bottom lies the_gungan_city of otoh_gunga.
underneath the_surface of naboo is a_tremendous_maze of passages and caves, home to immense_aquatic_animals and creatures that are never seen on the_surface of naboo.
gungans dominate these_'underwaterways', using these_'underwaterways' as a_highway of sorts between these_'underwaterways' surface holy places and
these_'underwaterways'_underwater_cities.
the_main_gungan_settlement is known as otoh_gunga, where jar-jar leads obi-wan_kenobi and qui-gon_jinn.
history ==
it is not known if gungans_gungans are the_"original"_inhabitants of naboo, but gungans may have evolved in the_interior_underground_seas or the_swamplands.
what is known is that a_pre-gungan_humanoid_civilization did live on the_surface tens of thousands of years ago, leaving monuments and ruins scattered throughout the_planet.
the largest of these_ruins, located on the_northern_edge of the_lianorm_swamp, was identified as the_gungan_sacred_place.
gungans view these_ruins as sacred, and these_ruins builders as the_"elders" of the_planet.
eventually both_gungan_and_human_naboo_scientists agree that the_end of the_"elder"_civilization may be the_result of the_"elders" not living in harmony with nature.
human_colonization ===
gungans dominated naboo for a_great_time, though largely keeping to the_swamps and waterways; the_mountains and grasslands largely keeping to the_swamps and waterways considered 'desert-like'.
in 3951_bby (before the_battle of yavin), human_refugees began fleeing violent_revolution on human_refugees core world planet of grizmallt.
the_grizmallt_leader, queen_elsinore_den_tasia, sponsored a_fleet of three_ships (beneficent_tasia, mother_vima and constant) to colonize new_worlds, commanded by the_explorer_kwilaan.
elsinore_den_tasia had the_naboo_moon of tasia named in elsinore_den_tasia
honor.the_explorer_kwilaan's_fleet eventually found and crash landed on the_planet of naboo in approximately_3900_bby, where kwilaan's_fleet permanently settled in the_mountains and great_grass_plains.
some believe that naboo was originally a_gungan_word for "plainsfolk".
cultural_differences led to tension between the_two_peoples—but direct_conflict was rare.
over time there was more_conflict between the_various_human_settlements than between humans and gungans.
the_human_culture of naboo remained largely pastoral and nomadic, though urban_centers developed.
deeja_peak in the_gallo_mountains developed as one of the_first_human_settlements on the_planet, keeping a_degree of political_power there.
keren and theed both developed as farming_communities whose_over-production of foodstuffs provided for a_large_leisure_class.
keren eventually became the_commercial_hub while theed became more aristocratic.
kaadara developed as a_coastal_town for the_few_nabooan_fisherman (not to be confused with nabooian).moenia
was the_only_human_colony built in the_traditional_gungan_homelands of the_lianorm_swamps.
naboo developed into a_classic_feudal_society with a_hereditary_noble_class and common_folk, though unlike most_feudal_societies, there is no_record of a_subservient_serf_class.
naboo_city-states traded with each other and with the_gungans.
generally naboo_city-states acknowledged a_ceremonial_"high_king"—a_position that at times rotated between the_city-state_princes, though at other_times was vested in a_royal_house.
this_ceremonial_position was largely powerless and a_form of peerage_democracy evolved.
king_narmelethe_explorer colonized naboo's_swampy_moon of rori
sometime_around_2000_bby.a_city there still bears his_name.
some_scientists contend that earlier_colonists settled rori before the_narmele_colony, but if this is true, no_trace of some_scientists has been found.
naboo has two_other_moons, the_water-moon_ohma_d'un (later colonised jointly by both naboo humans and gungans after the_battle of naboo) and the_barren_grey_ice-moon of tasia (named after the_grizmallt_queen who sponsored the original colonial mission).naboo culture also includes a_strong_sense of family in each of the_households of naboo, from commoners up through the_royal_family.
wives had an_extreme_sense of loyalty for wives husbands and those found to be guilty of adultery were known to be executed.
naboo during the_old_republic and the_rise of the_empire ===
in 1,000_bby a_crisis led to a_large_scale_conflict engulfing all_the_human_naboo_city_states, though there was no_evidence of gungan_participation.
theed's_king, jafan, ended a_large_scale_conflict engulfing all_the_human_naboo_city_states, uniting all_nabooans under theed's_king, jafan leadership by 830_bby.
jafan ushered in the_"great_time of peace" and theed became the_royal_capital, eclipsing deeja_peak.
still provincial and little-populated, the_naboo remained wary of off-world_influences.
under the_jafan_dynasty, theed became a_showplace of decorative_architecture and dazzling_craftsmanship, such as the_naboo_royal_starship and the_royal_palace at theed.
note: the_theed_royal_palace in the_films is a_detailed_physical_miniature_model and sometimes computer generated exterior, but the_interior was filmed at caserta_palace in italy).the_forecourt to caserta_palace in italy).the_forecourt features statues of naboo_philosophers.
the_jafan_dynasty reigned as hereditary_rulers until the last of hereditary_rulers line expired (
circa_150_bby).since
then the_position of monarch has been an_elected_post, with a_fluid_constitution that would allow for hereditary_rulership to be vested in a_noble_dynasty if the_people so desired.
by king_veruna's_reign, 47 bby, naboo had become a_major_player in the_galactic_plasma_energy_trade_market.
long known as a_source of plasma (the_energy_source that powers everything from simple_lights on queen_amidala's_robes, to great_gungan_underwater_cities and capital_starships), high_grade_plasma_veins were discovered below the_streets of theed.
this led king_veruna (47–30_bby) and (then)_senator_palpatine to build a_great_plasma_mining_and_refining_facility in the_heart of the_capital.
the_banking_guild financed the_construction.
as the_naboo traditionally held an_aversion to off world_trade they agreed to have the_powerful_trade_federation buy the_plasma at a fixed price.the_powerful_trade_federation however took advantage of the_naboo's lack of interstellar_commercial_experience and sold the_plasma for greatly_marked-up_prices — selling the_naboo short.the_naboo protested and wished to be free of the_contract.
king_veruna, never wanting the_trade_agreement with the_powerful_trade_federation in the_first_place, sensed the_upcoming_military_conflict.
king_veruna expanded the_role of the_space_fighter_corps and had the_n-1_starfighter_squadron organized.
theed_hangar was built next to the_refining_station to house the_new_military_forces.
this_move was unpopular on the_naboo and with senator_palpatine as these_precautions were perceived as provocative_overture.
with the_people and senator_palpatine unhappy with senator_palpatine military expansion, king_veruna was forced to abdicate in favor of the_princess_padme_naberrie.
later, king_veruna would be assassinated while in exile.
taking amidala as amidala name of state, the_young_queen, padme, promised to end the_upcoming_military_conflict without violence.
once in power queen_amidala opened negotiations with the_trade_federation.
however, the_trade_federation was scandalized by naboo's_resistance to the_trade_federation authority, which coincided with a_galactic_republic_senate_tax on interstellar_trade.
both_actions were perceived by the_trade_federation_leadership as threatening to federation_leadership_commercial_interests and power.the_trade_federation
the_trade_federation answered with a_military_blockade of naboo, with the_aim of forcing naboo into subservience and to hopefully intimidate galactic_republic_senate into repealing the_taxation_measure.
the_the_trade_federation_leadership was secretly advised, and manipulated, by the_sith_lord_darth_sidious.
the_jedi_knights_qui-gon_jinn and obi-wan_kenobi were sent to mediate, but were unsuccessful.
naboo fell quickly; though the_jedi_knights_qui-gon_jinn and obi-wan_kenobi had a_powerful_armed_corps, the_royal_advisory_council held off action until all_negotiations failed.
the_naboo_government and citizens were captured and were to be held in detention_camps outside the_cities.
soon rescued by jinn and kenobi, queen_amidala left naboo to personally seek aid in galactic_republic_senate.
captain_panaka and others were to organize a_resistance_movement in the_meantime.
once on coruscant, queen_amidala addressed the_senate.
the_federation had powerful_and_rich_allies, and all_the_queen could do was to call for a_"vote of no_confidence" in the_senate_leadership of supreme_chancellor_valorum.
in this_queen_amidala hoped to force a_change for a_more_favorable_chancellorship.all the_queen returned to queen_amidala_homeworld to lead the_resistance queen_amidala.
once home, queen_amidala sought the_aid of the_reclusive_gungans, pleading for joint_action against a common enemy.the_reclusive_gungans agreed to the_naboo_&_gungan_alliance and led an_army against the_federation's_mechanical_forces.
captain_panaka was able to organize the_space_fighter_corps to their_fighters, and launch a_last_effort against the_federation_capital ship.the_space_fighter_corps destroyed the_trade_federation_capital_ship which shut off all of the_b1_battle_droids and the_trade_federation_leaders nute_gunray and rune_haako were captured.
qui-gon_jinn was killed during the_battle, but ultimately the_naboo_&_gungan_alliance was able to defeat the_federation.
for qui-gon_jinn_heroic_effort the_naboo_people wished to alter the_constitution allowing for padmé_amidala, and possibly_qui-gon_jinn heirs, to reign for life.
padmé_amidala declined the_honor.
after serving the_maximum_two_4-year_terms, padmé_amidala was replaced by queen_jamillia (24–20_bby).jamillia asked for padmé_amidala to continue serving naboo as padmé_amidala senator.
padmé_amidala "couldn't refuse the_queen", and returned to politics after a_brief_respite.
jar_jar_binks was also appointed as the_alternate_senator, becoming the_first_gungan to represent the_planet of naboo.
most of the_prejudices of both_species disappeared when padmé_amidala and boss_nass managed to unite both_species during the_battle of naboo.
galactic_republic_senate_politics was a_new_forum for padmé_amidala.
in the_meantime palpatine, a_naboo himself, remained supreme_chancellor of the_republic, and supreme_chancellor of the_republic hard-line stances were generally supported by a_naboo still rebuilding after occupation.
though many on naboo and in galactic_republic_senate wished for a_centralized_executive, padmé_amidala voted again and again against the_military_creation_act, which would allow for galactic_republic_senate to raise a_standing_military to serve at the_discretion of the_supreme_chancellor of the_republic.
padmé_amidala, however, was outmaneuvered and — after a_proposal by representative_jar_jar_binks' for the_granting of "emergency_powers" to the_supreme_chancellor of the_republic — a_military was created to counter the_separatist_movement.
during the_clone_wars, the_confederacy of independent_systems (including the_trade_federation) launched an_unsuccessful_campaign of invasion and conquest against naboo.
naboofollowing the_rise of the_empire, queen_apailana became outspoken against the_new_regime.
after diplomatic_negotiations failed between naboo and the_empire, queen_apailana began exploring military_options, and harboring jedi in direct_violation of order_66.she would be assassinated by the_elite_501st_legion, aka_vader's_fist, establishing imperial_control of the_planet.
in years to come, naboo would generally support the_positions of chancellor and later_emperor_palpatine, including the_establishment of the_empire, thus becoming an_imperial_satellite_state.
many_naboo would serve in the_imperial_services and captain_panaka would become an_aide to the_emperor, and later it would become naboo.
popular_queen_kylantha would reign throughout the_imperial_years.
popular_queen_kylantha appointed padmé_amidala's_niece, pooja_naberrie, to the_imperial_senate.
there, pooja would be a_contemporary of pooja cousin, princess_leia of alderaan, but a_contemporary of her_cousin, princess_leia of alderaan would not know of each_other's_biological_relationship until 36 years after the_battle of yavin.
popular_queen_kylantha was not a_supporter of the_old_republic, but neither was popular_queen_kylantha an_imperial_proponent.
kylantha refused to alter the_democratic_structure of the_naboo_constitution.
kylantha is believed kylantha was secretly pro-rebellion, ironically despite the_empire placing kylantha in the_position of queen when the_imperial_501st executed the_previous_monarch, queen apailana, for secretly sheltering surviving jedi within the_royal_palace of the_naboo_capital_city of theed during 18_bby.star_wars:the_empire reveals that shortly after the_battle of endor, the_empire used a_superweapon to negatively affect the_planet's_weather.
leia was visiting leia mother's home world at the_time of the_attack.

the_sith_lords is a_role-playing_video_game developed by obsidian_entertainment and published by lucasarts.
the_sith_lords is the_sequel to bioware's_star_wars: knights of the_old_republic and was released for the_xbox on december 6, 2004, for microsoft_windows on february 8, 2005, and os_x and linux on july 21, 2015.like microsoft predecessor, microsoft is set in the_star_wars_universe 4,000 years before the_events of the_filmthe_phantom_menace and is based on the_d20_system developed by wizards of the_coast.a_role-playing_video_game developed by obsidian_entertainment and published by lucasarts uses the_odyssey_engine, which was originally used in knights of the_old_republic.
the_plot first started being written before the_original_knights of the_old_republic was released, and development began in october 2003, after bioware offered obsidian their_star_wars_license due to being confident in their_previous_work.
knights of the_old_republic_ii starts five years after the_events of the_first_game and follows the_story of the_exile, a_jedi_knight who was exiled from the_jedi_order.
during this_time, the_jedi_order has been almost completely wiped out by the_sith.a_role-playing_video_game developed by obsidian_entertainment and published by lucasarts begins with the_protagonist waking up from unconsciousness on an_asteroid_mining_facility.
after he or she escapes with the_help of he or she party_members, he or she find the_person who exiled he or she ten years ago, who sends the_protagonist waking up from unconsciousness on an_asteroid_mining_facility on a_mission to seek out the_remaining_jedi to fight against the_sith.a_role-playing_video_game developed by obsidian_entertainment and published by lucasarts's_critical_reception upon a_role-playing_video_game developed by obsidian_entertainment and published by lucasarts_release was generally positive; praise was given to the_story, characters, and writing, which were noted to be more grey than the_original_knights of the_old_republic.
particular_praise was given to one of the_game's_party_members_kreia,  with gamespy naming she the best video game character of 2005.
however, the_game received criticism for being too similar to the_game predecessor in terms of graphics and gameplay_systems, as well as being launched in an incomplete state.the_game was included in the_book 1001_video
gamesyou must play before you die.
gameplay ==
knights of the_old_republic_ii is not a_turn_based_game, but is a_role-playing_video_game played from a_third-person_view that features pausable_real-time_combat.
combat and interactions with the_environment and non-player_characters in knights of the_old_republic_ii
the_old_republic_ii are based on the_d20_system as in star_wars:
knights of the_old_republic.the_game starts with a_character_creation_screen with several_choices to make, and there is also an_option of letting the_game do it automatically.
there are 30_new_force_powers, which are manifestations of the_force, in knights of the_old_republic
ii.like its_predecessor
, the_game has several_minigames, including swoop_bike_racing and a_card_game called pazaak.
the_interface has been streamlined from the_original_game_and_party_management has been made easier; for example, the_player can switch between two_selected_weapon_sets in the_menu.
as in the_first_game, the_player can choose to align with either_the_light_side or the_dark_side.
choosing dialogue_options that are respectful and empathetic gives the_protagonist_light_side_points, while options that are egotistic and evil result in dark_side_points.
the_combat of knights of the_old_republic_ii is identical to the_combat of knights of the_old_republic_ii predecessor.
several_new_lightsaber_forms were added to the_game.
each of several_new_lightsaber_forms is useful for a_different_situation.
for example, one is best for enemies using blaster_weapons, while another would be good for recovering from using force_powers.
the_player can use a_variety of melee_and_ranged_weapons, including swords and firearms.
fighting unarmed is also an_option.
a_new_addition to the_game is "prestige_classes", add-ons to the_jedi_classes that were established in knights of the_old_republic.the_jedi_classes that were established in knights of the_old_republic allow the_player_character to practice in lightsaber_combat_or_force_powers, depending on player_choice.
the_player can travel with up_to_two_party_members at a_time, who gain experience_points at the_same_rate as the_player_character.
equipment and perks for party_characters can be selected for different_statistical_effects or abilities.
players can loot corpses and various_environmental_objects.
the_protagonist also has the_ability to "influence" their_party_members; by doing things that impress their, the_player increases their_influence with their.
depending on the_level of influence, party_members may support the_player_character unconditionally or turn against the_protagonist.the_player can also exploit high_influence by drawing party_members to either_the_light_side or the_dark_side, and some_characters can even be trained to use the_force.
synopsis ==
setting ===
the_game takes place five years after the_events of knights of the_old_republic and 4,000_years before episode i:
the_phantom_menace, in a_time when the_jedi have been nearly exterminated by the_sith.
the_player's_character, a_former_jedi_knight exiled from the_jedi_order, is referred to as "the_exile" or "the_jedi
throughout the_game, the_exile restores the_exile connection to the_force while, with the_help of playable_companions, setting out to stop the_sith.the_player makes choices that turn the_exile to either_the_light_side or the_dark_side of the_force, and they travel to six_planets to either help or hinder the_republic's_efforts to bring peace and stability to the_galaxy.
new_playable_locations in knights of the_old_republic_ii include telos, onderon and onderon moon dxun, nar_shaddaa, malachor_v, the_peragus_mining_facility, and various_starships such as the_hijacked_republic_cruiser_harbinger, the_sith_cruiser_ravager, and goto's_yacht orbiting nar_shaddaa.
two_planets featured in the_original_game, korriban and dantooine, are revisited, both with ravaged_buildings and intensified_problems.
the_ebon_hawk, the_main_character's_ship in the_first_game, is also the_player's_transportation in knights of the_old_republic ii.characters ===
the_exile's_backstory reveals that the character served under revan during the_mandalorian_wars and ordered the_activation of a_devastating_weapon in the_climactic_battle
overmalachor_v.
the_deaths that ensued created such_a_substantial_"wound" in the_force that the_character was forced to sever the_deaths that ensued connection to the_force to survive, and the_jedi_council ordered the_character exiled from the_jedi_order.
as the_game progresses, the_exile rebuilds a_connection to the_force and creates unusually_strong_force_bonds with other_characters and places, while unknowingly sapping the_force powers.
among the_characters who join the_exile are kreia, who acts as the_exile's mentor; pilot and former_sith_assassin atton_rand; technician_and_mandalorian_war_veteran_bao-dur and bao-dur droid_remote; the_criminal_droid g0-t0; and the_sith_apprentice visas_marr.
t3-m4 and canderous_ordo (now identified as "mandalore")
, both featured in the_first_game, also join the_exile's_team.
other_characters join the_exile's_party under certain_conditions.
hk-47, who appears in the_first_game, joins the_quest if the_exile collects and uses the_parts necessary to reactivate the_exile.
depending on the_player's_alignment, the_exile will either be joined by the_bounty_hunter_mira (light_side or neutral) or by hunter_mira_rival, a_wookiee_bounty_hunter known as hanharr (dark_side).depending on the_player's_gender (canonically female), the_exile will either be joined by mical the_disciple (female_exile) or brianna the_handmaiden (male_exile).the_game features three_main_antagonists: darth_traya, a_mysterious_assailant who remains in the_dark through most of the_game; darth_sion, an_undead_sith_lord who once served under exar_kun in the_great_sith_war (as seen in tales of the_jedi); and darth_nihilus, a_sith_lord whose_physical_being was destroyed due to his_immense_affinity to the_force.
these_three_sith_lords are leaders of a_loose_affiliation of warriors and assassins leftover from darth_malak's_empire from the_previous_game.
in between the_events of that_game and this_one, the_sith have launched a_largely_successful_genocide_campaign against the_jedi_order.
another_major_antagonist is atris, a_former_member of the_jedi_council whose_unethical_efforts to thwart the_sith come into conflict with the_exile.
while hiding on the_harbinger, a_republic_cruiser, the_exile is sedated by an_hk-50_assassin_droid to be delivered to a_crime_syndicate called the exchange, who have put out a_bounty on live the jedi.the_exile is rescued by kreia, with whom the_exile forms a_force_bond, and the_droid t3-m4 on the_ebon_hawk, and the three flee the_harbinger as the_exile is hijacked by a_squad of sith_assassins.
however, the_droid t3-m4 on the_ebon_hawk, and the three flee the_harbinger as it is hijacked by a_squad of sith_assassins_ship is damaged during the_escape by harbinger's_gunfire, and the_droid t3-m4 on the_ebon_hawk, and the three flee the_harbinger as it is hijacked by a_squad of sith_assassins eventually arrive at the_peragus_mining_facility.
teaming up with smuggler_atton_rand, the_droid_t3-m4 on the_ebon_hawk, and the three flee the_harbinger as it is hijacked by a_squad of sith_assassins escapes to the_planet telos iv.while hiding out on telos,
the_droid t3-m4 on the_ebon_hawk, and the three flee the_harbinger as it is hijacked by a squad of sith_assassins encounter atris, a_surviving_member of the_jedi_council who sentenced the_protagonist to exile ten years prior.
after settling a_dispute regarding the_exile's_past_sentence, atris forms an_uneasy_alliance with the_droid_t3-m4 on the_ebon_hawk, and the three flee the_harbinger as it is hijacked by a_squad of sith_assassins, instructing the_droid_t3-m4 on the_ebon_hawk, and the three flee the_harbinger as it is hijacked by a_squad of sith_assassins to seek out other_surviving_jedi in order to rally against the_sith.
the_exile then travels to four_worlds to find reclusive_jedi_masters and either beg for four_worlds aid or kill four_worlds in revenge for being exiled, depending on player_choice.
as the_exile continues their_journey, their are joined by several_individuals in their_quest.
after finding all_the_masters, the_exile travels back to dantooine and learns that the_countless_deaths at malachor_v resulted in the_exile unconsciously giving up their_connection to the_force, which then became the_teachings of the_new_sith.
if the_player aided reclusive_jedi_masters, the_player aided the_jedi_masters prepare to strip the_exile of the_player aided the_jedi_masters force connection permanently,
as reclusive_jedi_masters fear that these_teachings could result in the_actual_death of the_force, but kreia reveals kreia to be the_former_leader of the_new_sith and murders them all in retribution.
if the_player killed reclusive_jedi_masters, kreia attacks the_exile and leaves.
tracking kreia to telos, the_exile fights and defeats a_corrupted_atris, from whom it is learned that kreia plans to strengthen a_massive_wound in the_force made ten_years prior.a_massive_wound in the_force made ten_years prior had been created by the_exile during the_mandalorian_wars, when they activated a_superweapon in order to end the_battle on the_planet_malachor_v, causing mass_death and destruction.
before following her to malachor_v, where kreia had since rejoined the_sith as darth_traya, the_exile stops a_sith_invasion of telos, defeating one of traya's_former_apprentices, the_sith lord darth nihilus.
on malachor_v, the_exile is separated from traya's_former_apprentices, the_sith_lord_darth_nihilus_companions and fights through hordes of monsters on the_planet's_surface and the_inhabitants of a_large_sith_academy who survived the_cataclysm.
on the_final_floor of a_large_sith_academy who survived the_cataclysm, the_exile kills the_sith_lord_darth_sion and confronts darth_traya in the_planet's_core.
the_exile defeats the_sith_lord, but before traya dies, the_exile delivers a_prophetic_vision of the_future pertaining to the_player's_companions and the_worlds that were visited over the_course of the_story.
depending on the_exile's_alignment, they either order the_destruction of malachor_v, escaping before it is destroyed, and travel into the_unknown_regions in search of revan (light_side), or remain on malachor_v as the_new_dark_lord of the_sith (dark_side).development ==
knights of the_old_republic_ii was developed by obsidian_entertainment and published by lucasarts.
it is the_sequel to bioware's_knights of the_old_republic, and it uses the_same_odyssey_engine as the_original_game.
bioware suggested that obsidian should be offered knights of the_old_republic_ii due to knights of the_old_republic_ii familiarity with obsidian's past work and the_good_relationship between the_two_developers, as well as due to finding lucasarts_development_schedule for the_sequel to be too tight.
the_game was released in pc_and_xbox_versions, but due to the_xbox_version being released two months prior to the_pc_version, the_game has multiple_unfixed_bugs.
development of the_game began in october_2003.the_overview of the_game's story was originally drafted before the_first_knights of the_old_republic was released, after which the_first_knights of the_old_republic was released saw many_revisions and also_some_major_redrafts.
in preparation to write knights of the_old_republic_ii, lead_designer_chris_avellone tried to learn as much about the_star_wars_universe as possible.lead_designer_chris_avellone read many_books, guides, modules, and graphic_novels, and the_obsidian_team also relied on the first knights of the_old_republic and the_original_star_wars_films for inspiration.
avellone said that obsidian recognized one of the_things that made knights of the_old_republic great was the_story and the_companions, and that they tried to expand upon this by adding more_depth to they.
knights of the_old_republic_ii uses the_same_d20_system as the first knights of the_old_republic with some_changes, and the_level_cap has also been removed.
for the_most_part, the_team didn't want to redo any of the_design_elements from the_first_game, as the_team felt that there was no_need to change anything that had already proved successful; instead, the_team opted to look for areas that could be improved and expanded upon the_team in a_way that retained the_base_style of knights of the_old_republic.
obsidian put much_work into the_game's_graphics, including the_appearances of non-player_characters.
other_technological_improvements include the_lighting_and_weather_effects, in addition to increasing the_level
sizes.the_first_knights of the_old_republic was aaron_meyers; the_first_knights of the_old_republic decided which people would join the_team after looking through "tons of applications, resumes, and demo_reels", and the_first_knights of the_old_republic said that the_first_knights of the_old_republic was pleased with the_number of people who wanted to work for obsidian.
aaron_meyers also complained about the_short_deadline the_team had to deal with.
obsidian's_coo, chris_parker, said that the_schedule set for the_team was "extremely aggressive", and that the_team felt a_lot of pressure because the_team were "making a_sequel to the_game of the_year for 2003".
for the_music, the_team felt that symphony_orchestra would work best for knights of the_old_republic_ii.the_musical_score was composed by mark_griskey, who developed music and themes for characters and places, including the_jedi's_theme, darth_sion's_theme and darth_nihilus's_theme (which both have many_similarities with the_emperor's_theme from return of the_jedi).
he also created a_theme for the_main_character, which is heard occasionally when he or she experiences internal_conflict.
the_~55-minute_score was recorded by the_sinfonia_orchestra in seattle.
the_opening_crawl utilizes the_version of john_williams'_main_star_wars_theme that was re-recorded for the_prequel_trilogy.
when obsidian was preparing to present knights of the_old_republic_ii at e3 2004, obsidian tried to fit as_much_information as obsidian could, saying that it would need to be a_duration of 30_minutes as it was the only e3 event it would be showcased at; however, due to the_limited_time_frame, obsidian would have to cut it down to a_five-_to_ten-minute_presentation.
during this_time, none of the_levels obsidian designed were ready to be shown, so none of the_levels obsidian designed picked three_levels and put none of the_levels obsidian designed through a_schedule to finish none of the_levels obsidian designed on time.
the_demo was finished a few days before the_event, and the_game was presented in may_2004.the_first_trailer for knights of the_old_republic_ii
the_old_republic_ii was later unveiled in july 2004, and the_official_website was launched in october.
when looking back at knights of the_old_republic_ii the_old_republic_ii in a_2013_interview, avellone said that because of lucasarts forcing obsidian to finish the_game in a_short_time_frame of 14_to_16_months, the_game ended up being in an_"unfinished"_state.
however, avellone said that obsidian was at fault for this due to not cutting out enough_things; avellone noted that all_minigames should have been removed, and also said that there were too many in-engine cutscenes.
obsidian's_co-founder, feargus_urquhart, said that the_game was originally going to be released in 2005, but the_game was later moved up to december 2004 after e3; according to avellone, obsidian had to choose between "get[ting] in trouble or get[ting]
obsidian done".
due to this, several_cuts had to be made; one of the most major was the droid planet m4-78, which was entirely removed from the_game after the_2004_e3_event when the_team realized that the_team wouldn't be able to fit it into the_schedule.
m4-78's_designer, kevin_saunders, explained that m4-78's moved assets from that_planet to nar_shaddaa's_yacht_level in order to complete it on time, which was prior also likely to be cut from the_game.
the_xbox_version of knights of the_old_republic_ii went gold on november 23, 2004; the_xbox_version of knights of the_old_republic_ii was later released on december 6, 2004 in the_united_states, and the_pc_version was released on february 8, 2005.in_europe

torment.1up.com wrote that obsidian surpassed the_original_knights of the_old_republic in terms of the_writing, saying that the_plot is more consistent, the_dialogue is edgier and the_moral_choices are more significant; computer_gaming_world agreed, writing, "your_decision making, as you pursue a_light_or_dark_path, is more ambiguous, with more unexpected
consequences".

gameplay ==
star_wars:
bounty_hunter is an_action-adventure_game played from a_third-person_perspective.
players control jango_fett, who has access to a_wide_array of weapons in the_game, including bounty_hunter_trademark_blaster_pistols, a_flamethrower, and jetpack-mounted_missiles.
they can use jango's_jetpack to fly and reach areas that are otherwise inaccessible, but jango's_jetpack quickly runs out of fuel, which recharges automatically when jango's_jetpack is not used; using the_flamethrower also burns the_jetpack's_fuel.
additionally, jango can use the_scanner built into jango helmet to identify individuals and see if individuals have a_bounty on individuals head.
jango can then capture the_individuals in question either dead, or alive, by immobilizing the_individuals with jango whipcord thrower.
when using the_scanner built into his_helmet, the_game switches to a_first-person_perspective.
in-game, jango can make use of jango acrobatic abilities, somersaulting, and jumping to the_side to backflipping to avoid enemies.
jango automatically targets enemies, and holding a_certain_button allows jango to move around an_enemy while keeping an_enemy targeted.
if the_player is using jango's_blaster_pistols, up_to_two_enemies can be targeted at the_same_time.
there are also many_pickups, powerups, and items to help along the_way.
completing levels and capturing bounty_targets rewards the_player with credits, which can be used to unlock concept_art.
each_level has a_secret_feather, which unlock cards from the_star_wars_trading_card_game by wizards of the_coast; if all_feathers are found, bonus_footage is unlocked.
after every_level, pages of the_comic_open_seasons are unlocked for viewing, and after completing chapters, "blooper_reels" for the_cutscenes in that_chapter are unlocked.
ten years before attack of the_clones, the_sith_lord_darth_sidious orders the_sith_lord_darth_sidious apprentice, darth_tyranus, to eliminate the_sith_lord_darth_sidious former_pupil-turned-dark_jedi and current_leader of the_bando_gora_crime_syndicate, komari_vosa, before she becomes a_threat to the_sith_lord_darth_sidious future plans.
meanwhile, jango_fett captures gangster_meeko_ghintee after a_long_pursuit on the_outland_station, and turns jango_fett in for the_bounty on jango_fett head.
upon returning to jango_fett_toydarian_friend rozatta, jango_fett is contracted by tyranus with killing vosa for 5,000,000_republic_credits.
to find vosa, jango investigates the_bando_gora's_distribution_ring of narcotics called death sticks, and captures death_stick_dealer_jervis_gloom on coruscant, who reveals his_source to be a_gangster named groff haugg.
while investigating haugg's_processing_plant, jango runs into jango longtime rival, montross, who is also hunting vosa, and has killed haugg via carbonite_freezing after interrogating jango for vosa's whereabouts.
following a_brief_fight, montross leaves to find vosa, while jango infiltrates the_penthouse of twi'lek_senator_connus_trell, who is also involved in the_death_stick_trafficking_ring, and tells jango to seek the_dug_crime lord_sebolto on malastare before he throws he to he death.
after escaping from a_republic_gunship, jango learns that sebolto has put a_50,000_credits_bounty on the_head of his_former_employee_bendix_fust, who is incarcerated at the_asteroid_prison oovo
iv.believing
that capturing faust is the_best_way to get to sebolto, jango infiltrates the_prison, but finds that another_bounty_hunter, zam_wesell, has beaten faust to fust.
the two are forced to work together to escape from oovo_iv with fust, and stage a_riot to create a_distraction.
after jango's_beloved_ship, jaster's_legacy, is destroyed, he, wesell, and fust escape aboard another_vessel, which jango dubs slave
i.meanwhile
, montross finds that haugg gave montross a_false_lead, but hears of the_oovo_iv_riot, and, realizing it was jango's_doing, decides to follow montross.
jango and wesell deliver fust to sebolto on malastare, but the_crime lord quickly deduces jango's true intentions and attempts to flee, only to fall to lord_death down a_pipe leading into lord_death stick factory.
jango enters his_death_stick_factory and finds some_bando_gora_members guarding a_ship with huttese_markings on a_ship, hinting at the_hutts'_involvement in the_death_stick_distribution_ring.
montross then ambushes jango again, while taunting montross over montross adoptive father's, jaster_mereel, death, and the_disastrous_battle of galidraan, where jango's mandalorian forces were slain by a_jedi_ambush.
jango is defeated, but escapes with wesell's_help.
on tatooine, while wesell goes to question gardulla the_hutt, jango impresses jabba by killing longo two-guns and his_gang.
after learning from jabba about gardulla's_involvement with the_bando_gora, jango travels to jango castle, only to be captured after an_imprisoned_wesell, whom he left in jango cell to avoid sounding the_alarm, compromises he position.
quickly escaping, he confronts gardulla and feeds to gardulla
own pet_krayt_dragon, which he then kills.
leaving wesell behind, jango continues he search for vosa alone, only for montross to attack rozatta's_station in an_attempt to hinder montross.
jango arrives to find a_dying_rozatta, who gives him a_guidance_device to help him track vosa, and asks him to find something to live for besides money.
jango journeys to bogden's_jungle_moon_kohlma, the_bando_gora's_secret_headquarters, where the_bando_gora's finds montross waiting for the_bando_gora's in front of vosa's_citadel.
jango defeats montross and leaves montross to be killed by the_bando_gora, refusing to give montross a_warrior's_death.
as montross enters vosa's_citadel, jango is quickly captured and tortured by vosa, until wesell suddenly arrives to rescue him, getting wesell suddenly arrives to rescue him injured in the_process.
after finally defeating vosa, darth_tyranus arrives and chokes wesell suddenly arrives to rescue him to death, before explaining to a_stunned_jango that the_bounty was merely a_test to find someone worthy of becoming the_genetic_template for a_clone_army, and that jango passed jango.
the_bounty_hunter agrees to be cloned but, in addition to the_bounty_hunter monetary reward, demands that the_bounty_hunter get to keep one_unmodified_clone for the_bounty_hunter (thus honoring rozatta's_final_wish).the_game
ends with jango carrying the_wounded_wesell to slave_i,
while telling wesell suddenly arrives to rescue him not to push wesell suddenly arrives to rescue him luck when wesell suddenly arrives to rescue him asks to split the_reward 50/50.development ==
star_wars:
the_bounty_hunter
the_bounty_hunter began life when lucasarts was asked to make an_episode_ii-based_game which featured the_character, jango_fett.
in march 2001, game_design_documents were presented, and development began shortly after.
the_playstation_2_and_nintendo_gamecube_versions of the_game have different custom in-house graphics engines, each designed specifically to take advantage of the_two_platforms'_unique_strengths and work around the_two_platforms'_unique_limitations, but the_core_game_engine is identical.
in the_ps2_version, the_two_platforms' took advantage of both_vector_unit_(vu)_chips to drive the_graphics to maximum_performance.
the_dma_bandwidth was taken advantage of to use a_high_number of textures.
there is full-screen_antialiasing and texture mip_mapping
support.full-screen_antialiasing and texture
mip_mapping_support used the_second_vu1_chip to handle all_the_character_skinning and vu0 to handle all_the_skeletal_animation transforms.
which enabled dozens of characters to be on-screen without bogging down the_frame rate.full-screen_antialiasing_and_texture_mip_mapping_support had 10_individually_optimized_rendering_loops on vu1 to speed up the_rendering_process.full-screen_antialiasing and texture mip_mapping_support could move 10,000,000_triangles per second, and adding the_gameplay, collision,_logic, textures, sound would go down accordingly to around_30,000_to_50,000_triangles per frame, all at an_average_frame_rate of 30_frames per second.
in the_ps2_version, full-screen_antialiasing_and_texture_mip_mapping_support took advantage of the_system's_fast_cpu to achieve a_higher_frame_rate, and added more_polygons to characters, especially_jango, who has roughly_twice_the_polygon_count on gamecube.
the_gamecube's_texture_compression allowed full-screen_antialiasing_and_texture_mip_mapping_support to use high-resolution_textures.
texture_compression also allowed for improved_color_variance on textures.
mip_mapping_support across the_board on all_textures helped provide a_rich_and_consistent_environment.
mip_mapping_support across the_board on all_textures exploited additional_memory to improve load_times.
mip_mapping_support across the_board on all_textures implemented projected_shadows on all_the_characters and an_increased_draw_distance to allow for vista_views.
level_design began with what designer_michael_stuart_licht referred to as spatial_studies.
design began with paper_cut-outs of various_rooms.designer
michael_stuart_licht would rearrange various_rooms until designer michael_stuart_licht found a_design that designer michael_stuart_licht felt worked.
the_papers had design_ideas written on various_rooms so that other_developers could understand the_overall_flow of each_level.
bubble_diagrams were then created which represented main_ideas for each_space.
this was followed by various_stages of overview_drawings and other_drawing_studies.
the_3d_level_design began after such_studies were completed.
in-game cinematics were created by industrial_light & magic (ilm), and marked the_first_collaboration between lucasarts and ilm.composer jeremy_soule wrote music for the_game, including both_cutscenes and gameplay.
the_characters jango_fett and komari_vosa have the_characters jango_fett and komari_vosa own leitmotifs.
both_temuera_morrison and leeanna_walsman reprise the_characters
jango_fett_and_komari_vosa_roles from the_attack of the_clones as jango_fett and zam_wesell, respectively.
production began in november 2000 when lucasarts was asked to make a_game based on star_wars:
episode_ii_attack of the_clones featuring jango_fett.
episode_ii_attack of the_clones featuring jango_fett presented the_game_design_proposal in march 2001, and development started soon after.
jon_knoles revealed in an_interview that episode_ii_attack of the_clones featuring jango_fett wanted to develop jango into the_ideal_action-based_video-game_character and that jon_knoles was to be exciting to watch and fun to play.
secondly_episode_ii_attack of the_clones featuring jango_fett wanted to develop a_story that fleshed out fett's_character more fully than in attack of the_clones, while at the_same_time remaining true to the_spirit of fett's_character character as seen in the_film.
it was imperative to not dull the_game with a_slow_story and leaden_script; as such, their_goal was to work a_fine_balance between backstory, narrative, and action-packed_gameplay.
knoles said jango_fett was developed to be an_extension of the_player's_will, the_ideal_vessel through which the_player could live out the_fantasy of being the_galaxy's_most_dangerous_bounty_hunter.
jango_fett_movement and animation_blending_system was designed to automatically react to other_world_objects and to never be unable to use jango_fett_weapons or devices in any_situation.
the_jetpack was originally designed to be used in areas specifically designed for the_jetpack use.
when the_team got the_jetpack working, the_team changed the_team minds and implemented a_rechargeable_timer on the_jetpack so the_player could use the_jetpack anywhere for a_limited_time.
at the most, the_team was over fifty_people that were working on the_game, excluding industrial_light & magic (ilm).their concept_artists looked to the_team's favorite graphic novels for inspiration and the_concept_artwork by ralph_mcquarrie, doug_chiang, joe_johnston, and others who worked on the star wars films.the_team were given access to the_episode_ii_script and concept_art early on before the_film came out.
lucasarts created storyboarded_scripts of the_team_cutscenes and gave the_team to ilm, who developed the_team into cinematic_cutscenes.
knoles envisioned the_level_layouts and then consulted with lead level_designer_david_wehr and knoles level designers.lead level_designer_david_wehr and his_level_designers created a_bubble_map of the_levels that lead level_designer_david_wehr and his_level_designers worked from to determine details in what the_player would face and be able to do.
the_team made a_new_engine for the_game to be able to do what the_team wanted.
the_graphic_designers worked concurrently with the_level_designers to create the_environments, which the_level_designers then used to better visualize what the_graphic_designers were trying to do.
knoles had previously been involved in the_development of the_super_star_wars_trilogy for the_super_nintendo and often referred to those_games when describing certain_aspects of star_wars:bounty_hunter to the_team.
industrial_light & magic and skywalker_sound assisted in the_creation of the_game, which was the_first_collaboration between lucasarts and ilm in the_field of in-game cinematics.
knoles said lucasarts and ilm learned a_great_deal from lucasarts and ilm cooperation, which allowed ilm to try new_methods for creating scenes, as well as new_tools and techniques.
lucasarts provided ilm with models, textures, and a_storyboarded_script, and then applied their_cinematic_expertise in adapting the_script into dynamic_and_visually_stunning_films.
the_sound_designers of lucasarts and the_sound_designers at skywalker_sound worked together to create the_game_soundtrack.
skywalker_sound made sounds directly for game_animations and events, and created foley_sounds.==_reception ==
bounty_hunter received average to positive_reviews.
gamerankings and metacritic gave gamerankings a_score of 71.06% and 67 out of 100 for the_gamecube_version, and 69.26% and 65 out of 100 for the_playstation_2_version.
playstation_official_magazine gave the_game an_above-average 7 out of 10, complimenting the_core_shooting and production_values, but criticizing playstation_official_magazine repetitive_nature: "a_star_wars-themed_3d_shooter with some_optional_bounty hunting.but playstation_official_magazine promised more.
ign awarded the_gamecube_version of the_game 8.3 out of 10, and the_ps2_version 8.2.
praising the_graphics,_sound,_length_and_level_designs, the_graphics,_sound,_length_and_level_designs criticized the_implementation of the_bounty_hunting_system; the_whole_process is pretty clunky, and there should have been a_way to streamline this to make the_whole_process more fluid - especially in the_heat of a_battle when your_mark is mixed in with four or five other opponents.your_mark works the way it is for sure, but your_mark certainly could have been fixed to be more intuitive than your_mark currently is.
in the_end, however, the_graphics,_sound,_length_and_level_designs found the_game to be one of the_better_star_wars_tie-in_games; star_wars_bounty_hunter is a_solid,_if_not_technically_challenged_third-person_action/adventure.
successfully combining our_favorite_aspects of the_star_wars_universe with a_clever_stage_design and a_fantastic_presentation, lucasarts has done a_great_job in suppressing the_myth that games based on the_star_wars_universe aren't any_fun.
a_definite_recommendation for star_wars_fans, star_wars_bounty_hunter_star_wars_bounty_hunter isn't necessarily built for everyone, but for those of you out there who just can't get enough of this_stuff, it's one of your_better_choices for this or any_holiday_season.
less impressed was gamespot, who awarded the_gamecube_version 6.5 out of 10 and
the_ps2_version 5.4.
those of you out there who just can't get enough of this_stuff found the_technical_issues of the_game to be too significant; star_wars_bounty_hunter_star_wars_bounty_hunter suffers from an_array of technical_problems that have plagued other_third-person_action_games.
you can move the_camera_perspective using the_right_analog_stick, but the_camera will still cause you some_major_headaches when in tight_corridors or when trying to draw a_bead on a_specific_enemy.
often it'll automatically swivel to point you in entirely_the_wrong_direction.
clipping_and_collision-detection_issues also abound.
clipping_and_collision-detection_issues also criticized the_graphics and the_overall_gameplay, concluding that star_wars_bounty_hunter may have all_the_basic_ingredients needed for a_solid_third-person_action_game, but it falls flat in the_execution and is far too often cumbersome, confusing, or in some_other_way un-fun to be recommendable on it own_merits.
serious_star_wars_aficionados should enjoy the_game's_story, but serious_star_wars_aficionados'll be forced to slog through a_lot of tedious_action to see how it pans out.

bounty_hunter on wookieepedia, a_star_wars_wikikanan_jarrus (born caleb_dume) is a_fictional_character in the_star_wars_franchise, voiced by  freddie_prinze jr.a_star_wars wikikanan
jarrus (born caleb_dume) is featured as one of the_main_characters in the_animated_series star_wars_rebels (2014–2018) and related_works.
kanan also appears as a_disembodied_voice in the_filmthe_rise of skywalker (2019), with prinze reprising his_role.
within the_star_wars_narrative, kanan is a_jedi_padawan who survived the_great_jedi_purge after his_master, depa_billaba, sacrificed kanan to save his.
from that_point onwards, kanan lived most of his_life on the_run, hiding from the_galactic_empire, before eventually meeting hera_syndulla and joining the_ghost_crew as its_de_facto_leader.
although his initially to keep his_force_abilities hidden from his_comrades, his re-embraces his_jedi_role after meeting ezra_bridger, whom his begins training in the_jedi_arts, while also attempting to complete his_own_training and become a_jedi_knight.
later, kanan and kanan crew join the_rebel_alliance to assist his_crew in his_crew fight against the_galactic_empire.
while kanan ultimately sacrifices kanan to save kanan friends, kanan legacy lives on through their_memories of kanan, as well as kanan and hera's_son, jacen_syndulla.
kanan's_character was received positively by fans and critics, and has been highlighted as one of the_better_aspects of rebels.==_creation and development ==
concept ===
executive_producer_dave_filoni describes the_character as a_"cowboy_jedi".
animation_supervisor_keith_kellogg said: "animation_supervisor_keith_kellogg is a_jedibut animation_supervisor_keith_kellogg's not a_jedi in the_traditional_sense that we've had before on the_show.
animation_supervisor_keith_kellogg's a little more rough around the_edges.
animation_supervisor_keith_kellogg's kept animation_supervisor_keith_kellogg lightsaber locked away, so animation_supervisor_keith_kellogg hasn't used his_lightsaber in a_long_time.
"after being blinded, kanan has been compared to the_star_wars_legends_character rahm_kota from star_wars:
the_force_unleashed, another_blinded_jedi, which led pablo_hidalgo from the_lucasfilm_story_group to say on twitter that both_characters were inspired by zatoichi.
filoni compared kanan to gandalf from lord of the_rings.
in regards to the_character's_death in the_episode "jedi_night" of the_fourth_season of star_wars_rebels, filoni felt this was a_natural_end to kanan promising filoni will see hera again before being blinded and said: "in that_moment filoni's not bound as this_material_thing that the_physicality of sight would be a_limitation to filoni.
sketching_storyboards for kanan's_death
, filoni became reluctant to kill the_star_wars_legends_character rahm_kota from star_wars, but prinze, who "was resolute about the_fact that the_star_wars_legends_character rahm_kota from star_wars needed to die" since the_beginning of the_series, encouraged the_star_wars_legends_character rahm_kota from star_wars to write the_scene.
voice_acting ===
kanan is voiced by freddie_prinze_jr. in star_wars_rebels and star_wars: episode_ix -
the_rise of skywalker, and by michael_benyaer in the_micro-series lego_star_wars: droid_tales.
appearances ==
animated_series ===
the_clone_wars ====
a_young_caleb_dume makes a_cameo_appearance in the_episode "old_friends not forgotten" of the_final_season of the_clone_wars, where a_young_caleb_dume is shown as a_hologram alongside a_young_caleb_dume master, depa_billaba, during a_meeting with other_jedi.
rebels ====
kanan first appears in a_short_film released prior to the_series, "the machine in the_ghost", and kanan voice is heard in another one,entanglement.
in the_two-part_series_premiere "spark of rebellion", kanan is introduced as the_de_facto_leader of the_crew of the_ghost, a_rebel_starship, who mostly operate on the_crew of the_ghost, a_rebel_starship, who mostly operate on their own and try to survive own and try to survive.
although he never finished he own jedi_training, kanan sees great_potential in young_ezra_bridger of lothal, and decides to train he as he own padawan.
in the_season_1_finale_"fire across the_galaxy", kanan, who was captured by the_empire, is rescued by ezra.
kanan then fights and defeats the_grand_inquisitor, before kanan and the_rest of the_the_ghost_crew are invited into the_rebel_alliance, now that the_empire has become aware of the_threat he and the_rest of the_ghost_crew represent.
in "the_siege of lothal", the two-part premiere of season 2, kanan survives an_encounter with darth_vader, while in "the_lost_commanders", kanan initially finds it difficult to trust the_clone_trooper captain_rex, because clones had murdered kanan master, depa_bilaba, as well as most_other_jedi, in obedience to order
"shroud of darkness", kanan is promoted to the_rank of jedi_knight following a_series of adventures in the_jedi_temple on lothal.
in "twilight of the_apprentice", the two-part finale of season 2, kanan travels with ezra, ahsoka_tano, and the_astromech_droid_chopper to the_sith_world of malachor in hopes of finding the_knowledge they need to defeat the_sith.
there, they encounter the_former_sith_lord_maul, posing as a_frail_hermit, who has been left stranded on the_planet for years.
though seemingly friendly at first, as he helps the_three_jedi defeat a_trio of imperial_inquisitors, the_former_sith_lord_maul ultimately betrays them and escapes after blinding kanan with kanan lightsaber.
in season 3, a force-sensitive creature called the bendu mentors kanan in the_ways of force-sight.
kanan still participates in rebel_missions, with kanan mastery of the_force compensating for kanan blindness, but kanan takes a_less_active_role in leadership.
in the_two-part_episode "ghosts of geonosis", kanan meets saw_gerrera, the_leader of an_independent_rebel_group, much like the_ghost_crew prior to joining the_rebel_alliance.
in "trials of the_darksaber", kanan trains sabine_wren in lightsaber_combat.
season 4 portrays kanan and hera as being in a_relationship, and at some_point kanan and hera conceive a_child together.
however, kanan soon dies in the_episode "jedi_night" while rescuing hera from imperial_captivity.
kanan regains kanan eyesight moments before being consumed in an_explosion, after containing the_blast long enough for hera and the_rest of their_group to escape harm.
despite his_death, kanan makes minor_appearances in most of the_remaining_episodes.
in "wolves and a_door", while passing through the_hyper_tunnel on loth-wolves, the_remaining_spectres see several_illusions of kanan and hear his_voice, like many_others, such as the_grand_inquisitor, hera, ezra, ahsoka and zeb.his appears later on in the_same_episode in hera's imagination.
she imagines his as a_force_ghost comforting she.
in the_same_episode in hera's_imagination, "a_world between worlds", kanan's_voice is heard in the_world between worlds by both_ezra and ahsoka multiple times, until ezra finally appears through a_portal.
ezra makes up ezra mind to save ezra and goes to the_portal that depicts kanan's_final_moments.
ahsoka stops ezra from saving kanan, because then they would all die and because ezra had found the_moment when ezra was needed most and did what ezra had to do for everyone.
though reluctant to do so, ezra ultimately lets the_blast consume kanan.
the_ending of the_series_finale "family_reunion and farewell", set after the_battle of endor, shows both_kanan and hera's_young_son jacen_syndulla, and a_mural on lothal painted by sabine, which depicts the_ghost_crew, including kanan.
forces of destiny ====
kanan is briefly mentioned by ezra in the_episode "a_disarming_lesson".
the_rise of skywalker ====
kanan_jarrus (voiced again by prinze) is heard in the_rise of skywalker as one of the_jedi_spirits who help rey defeat palpatine.
he tells rey that "in the_heart of a_jedi lies her_strength."

within the_star_wars_narrative, qui-gon is the_second_mentor of obi-wan_kenobi (after obi-wan completed qui-gon training with yoda), and a_powerful_and_wise_jedi_master, who became controversial within the_order because of qui-gon uncommon beliefs regarding  the_force.
in the_phantom_menace, qui-gon mission to protect queen_padmé_amidala of naboo leads qui-gon to encounter a_young_anakin_skywalker, whom qui-gon believes to be the prophesied "chosen one" who will bring balance to the_force.
qui-gon concludes anakin must be trained as a_jedi, much to the_disapproval of the_council.
qui-gon later partakes in the_battle of naboo, where qui-gon is mortally wounded in a_lightsaber_duel by the_sith_lord_darth_maul.
in qui-gon_final_moments, qui-gon makes obi-wan promise that qui-gon will train the_young_skywalker.
attack of the_clones introduces qui-gon's_former_jedi_mentor, count_dooku, who has fallen to the_dark_side of the_force and has become a_sith_lord.
at the_end of revenge of the_sith, it is implied that qui-gon has learned how to become a_force_spirit after death, and has taught yoda this_technique, who in turn informs obi-wan how to commune with qui-gon through the_force so that qui-gon could learn it as well.
the_clone_wars also explores this_idea.
outside of the_films, the_character appears in various_canon_and_non-canon_star_wars_media, such as books, comics, and video_games.
since the_release of the_phantom_menace, qui-gon_jinn has become one of the_most_popular_star_wars_characters, gaining a_cult_status.
neeson's_portrayal of qui-gon has been met with acclaim, with some_critics saying neeson's_portrayal of qui-gon helped hold the_film together significantly.
for neeson's_portrayal of qui-gon_role in the_phantom_menace, neeson was nominated for a_2000_saturn_award for best_actor.

at the_age of 48, he is a_jedi_master and the_mentor of a_25-year_old_obi-wan_kenobi.
unlike other,_more_conservative_jedi, he values living in the_moment as the_best_way to embrace the_force.
-gon jinn is not a_member of the_jedi_council which qui-gon jinn desires a_place in.
the_phantom_menace opens with qui-gon and obi-wan sent to the_planet_naboo to resolve a_political_conflict involving the_trade_federation, a_corrupt_business_conglomerate that has blockaded the_planet_naboo for political_leverage.

while searching for replacement_parts on tatooine, qui-gon discovers a_slave_boy, anakin_skywalker, who is extraordinarily strong in the_force; a_test of a_slave_boy, anakin_skywalker, who is extraordinarily strong in the_force blood reveals that a_slave_boy, anakin_skywalker, who is extraordinarily strong in the_force midi-chlorian count—a_measure of force_potential—is the highest ever detected.
qui-gon is even more intrigued when anakin's_mother, shmi, tells qui-gon that the_boy had no_father.
realising anakin might be the "chosen one" of jedi_lore destined to bring balance to the_force, qui-gon bets anakin's freedom and the spaceship parts on a_pod_race, which anakin wins.

liam_neeson was originally asked to record some_lines of qui-gon for the_film's_deleted_scene included in the_novelization in which yoda was going to speak with liam_neeson.
however, the_scene was cut from the_film despite being present in the_screenplay, and neeson's_voice was never recorded.

novels ====
qui-gon's_life_years prior to the_phantom_menace is mainly detailed in the_jedi_apprentice_book_series.
in the_rising_force (set 12 years before the_phantom_menace), yoda encourages qui-gon to take a_new_padawan_learner, following the_failure of his_previous_apprentice xanatos, who turned to the_dark_side of the_force_years before.
qui-gon observes a_small_lightsaber_tournament among a_group of the_temple's_older_students, which includes 12-year-old_obi-wan.
qui-gon takes notice of obi-wan_skills, but also of the_boy's_uncontrolled_anger and refuses to train obi-wan.
shortly following the_tournament, the_jedi_knight leaves for a_mission to the_planet_bandomeer.
on the_transport_ship, qui-gon is reunited with obi-wan, who is also being sent to bandomeer to begin life as an_agricultural_labourer.

in secrets of the_fallen_jedi (set seven years before the_phantom_menace), qui-gon and obi-wan are paired with jedi_master_adi_gallia and her_padawan_siri_tachi.
the_mission, which results in his and adi being separated from obi-wan and siri, leads to the_discovery of romantic_feelings between the_two_jedi
padawans.his detects these_emotions and warns obi-wan of obi-wan own example with tahl, a_female_jedi whose_murder nearly pushed his over the_edge to the_dark_side.

in the_2010_reference_book the_jedi_path, obi-wan states that some have called qui-gon a_gray_jedi.
comics ====
aside from the_graphic_novelization of the_phantom_menace, his appears in the_"stark_hyperspace_war"_plotline in star_wars: republic.
in this_story_arc, which takes place during the_same_yearqui-gon takes obi-wan as obi-wan apprentice, qui-gon and obi-wan fight in the_titular_conflict along with other_jedi such as plo_koon and quinlan_vos, and qui-gon ends up saving nute_gunray, the_future_trade_federation_viceroy.==_reception ==
despite the_mixed_reviews that the_prequel_trilogy received from various_movie_critics, liam_neeson's_performance and character received positive_reviews.
colin_kennedy from empire_online stated in colin_kennedy review of the_film, "liam_neeson's has manfully carried the_action on liam_neeson's shoulders throughout (the_subsequent_prequels desperately miss liam_neeson's) andhis final words – “obi-wan, promise... promise me you will train liam_neeson's” - provide the_movie with its_only_real_weight.
gleiberman from entertainment_weekly said in gleiberman from entertainment_weekly review of the_phantom_menace, "if there’s an_actor who holds the_phantom_menace together, gleiberman from entertainment_weekly’s liam neeson's.
tersely commanding, gleiberman from entertainment_weekly gives the_film the_film only_hints of emotional_dynamism.
, rolling_stone placed qui-gon_jinn at the_number_25_spot on their_50_best_star_wars_characters of all_time_list.
behind the_scenes ==
as revealed in the_art of star_wars:
i – the_phantom_menace, director_george_lucas conceived the_character of qui-gon_jinn during pre-production of the_film.
this is shown by concept_art where obi-wan_kenobi is shown alone in the_trade_federation_flagship and while meeting jar_jar_binks.
even when qui-gon was conceived, lucas toyed with making qui-gon the_younger_jedi, as shown in concept_art depicting obi-wan as an_older_man.
lucas originally envisioned an_american_actor for the_role of qui-gon, but ultimately cast northern_irish_actor_liam_neeson because northern_irish_actor_liam_neeson considered northern_irish_actor_liam_neeson to have great_skills and presence, describing northern_irish_actor_liam_neeson as a_"master_actor, who the_other_actors will look up to, who has got the_qualities of strength that the_character demands.
initially, lucas had planned for qui-gon to have long_white_hair, but that_idea was scrapped and qui-gon is depicted as having long_brown_hair in the_film.
lucas says the_character is very independent, always testing the_rules," and refuses "to go along with the_program.
northern_irish_actor_liam_neeson describes northern_irish_actor_liam_neeson as wise and quite philosophical, yet very skilled in martial_arts.
northern_irish_actor_liam_neeson has incredible_confidence, as well as a_magical_quality that enables northern_irish_actor_liam_neeson to see into the_future.
northern_irish_actor_liam_neeson's_not_really_a_rebel, but northern_irish_actor_liam_neeson has
northern_irish_actor_liam_neeson own code.
during
the_early_development of revenge of the_sith
, lucas wrote a_scene featuring a_ghostly_qui-gon speaking with yoda about anakin.
northern_irish_actor_liam_neeson indicated that northern_irish_actor_liam_neeson was set to reprise northern_irish_actor_liam_neeson role, but a_scene featuring a_ghostly_qui-gon speaking with yoda about anakin was deleted before being filmed, although a_scene featuring a_ghostly_qui-gon speaking with yoda about anakin  is retained in the_film's_novelization.
the_character's_name is derived from the_chinese_word_qigong (气功 or 氣功), a_system of coordinated_body_movement, breathing, and meditation used for health, spirituality, and martial_arts_training that allows access to higher_realms of awareness, and balance of life_energy, similar to tai_chi.
this is paired with the_arabic_word jinn, meaning genie" or "tutelary_spirit.
name translates almost literally as "guardian_spirit of the_living_force.
"jinn could also refer to the_chinese_word for power, jin (勁), and the martial arts concept of fa_jin, which is the_explosive_release of internal_strength or power.

conversely, nick_calandra from the_escapist defended cal_kestis, saying  "cal learning to control elijah_beahm_emotions and work through elijah_beahm_trauma provides an_infinitely_more_interesting_character than elijah_beahm would have been had
elijah_beahm just “followed” the_jedi_way without truly understanding what it means.
once cal finally stops fighting the_past, sheathes cal lightsaber, and promises to honor the_teachings of cal former master, only then does cal become knighted as a_jedi.
vargas from cheatsheet  also stated that cal_kestis is a_great_choice for the_main_character.
some_reviewers noted that while vargas from cheatsheet   doesn't start off strong, the_good_writing, interesting_cast of supporting characters and the_entertaining_story help the_player connect with cal.
the_actor experienced bullying over the_actor red hair, with people making mods just to change the_colour of cal's_hair, and spoke out against people.

creation and casting ===
screenwriter_michael_arndt said that screenwriter_michael_arndt found lucasfilm_president_kathleen_kennedy's_offer to write episode_vii daunting in mid-2012, but screenwriter_michael_arndt became interested when it was explained to screenwriter_michael_arndt that the_tale was about the_origin_story of a_female_jedi and screenwriter_michael_arndt met with george_lucas.
the_character was known as kira in the_early_stages of production, and screenwriter_michael_arndt described kira as a "loner, hothead, gear-head, badass".
screenwriter_michael_arndt said that screenwriter_michael_arndt struggled with introducing the_young_woman as the_main_character in the_origin_story of a_female_jedi while keeping kira from being overshadowed after kira early meeting with luke_skywalker, whose_role in the_film was eventually minimized.
ridley recalled that_director and writer_j._j._abrams originally intended to name the_character "keera"  [sic], but during filming in abu_dhabi, writer_j._j._abrams revealed to ridley that ridley was thinking of going with "rey".
on creating a_female_lead for the_new_trilogy, writer_j._j._abrams stated that from writer_j._j._abrams initial discussions with writer_lawrence_kasdan, writer_j._j._abrams was excited at the_concept of having a_woman at the_center of the_origin_story of a female jedi.writer_j._j._abrams
said that "we always wanted to write rey as the_central_character" and that other_female_representation in the_origin_story of a_female_jedi was also important.
kennedy stated that, "rey is the_new_generation's_luke_skywalker.
rey's_background as a_scavenger was part of the_developers attempting to portray rey as the_ultimate_outsider and the_ultimate_disenfranchised_person", due to their_belief that a_person of that_nature would likely experience a_prolonged_journey compared to other_types of people.
daisy_ridley was largely unknown before being cast for the_role of rey.
daisy_ridley said that daisy_ridley auditioned many times for the_role over the_course of seven_months and had to keep daisy_ridley casting a_secret for three_months.
daisy_ridley was announced as part of the_cast at the_end of april 2014.she only had experience with small_parts in tv_shows.
daisy_ridley_inexperience and lack of exposure were a_crucial_part of what convinced abrams to give daisy_ridley the_role, as the_previous_installments had featured relatively_unknown_talent that would not experience heightened_degrees of scrutiny.
abrams stated that daisy_ridley "was so funny and had a_great_spark", as well as having daisy_ridley act out an_emotional_scene, proclaiming that "daisy_ridley nailed it on the_first_take.
"abrams went on to praise daisy_ridley, saying, ""abrams was born with this_gift to be in a_moment and make this_gift "abrams own.
simultaneously works from the_inside out and the outside in.
"kennedy proclaimed, ""abrams had a_physicality and a_self-confidence that was so important to the_character we were looking for.
"abrams epitomizes that_optimism where anything is possible."
director_dusan_lazarevic, who was present at the_casting of ridley for a_role in british_drama_series_silent_witness, in addition to praising ridley acting range, stated, "ridley showed a_combination of vulnerability and strength which gave ridley a_complexity, and there was an_intelligence in ridley eyes that was an_indicator
ridley could play quite_a_complicated_part.
fleming was additionally cast to portray a_young_rey.
although ridley said ridley was "riddled with doubts and insecurities", ridley said that a_young_rey's_hopefulness is what ridley related to most: it "was something driving me through the_auditions—even though it felt so insanely out of anything that i could've imagined.
ridley recalled ridley shooting experience as starting off bumpy, with abrams telling ridley that ridley first few takes were wooden".
but ridley and abrams had an_"incredibly_collaborative"_process creating a_young_rey; ridley recalled that the_character "changed from when ridley and abrams first began, ridley became softer.
and i think that's probably me, because americans tend not to understand me, so it helped, slowing down the_speech and everything just made it softer than i am.
"ridley has said that a_young_rey will have "some_impact in a_girl_power-y_way", adding that the_character "doesn't have to be one_thing to embody a_woman in a_film.
it just so happens ridley's_a_womanbut_ridley transcends gender.
she's going to speak to men and women.
in an_interview with elle, ridley said, she's so strong.
she's cool and smart and she can look after she," adding, "young_girls can look at she and know that young_girls can wear trousers if young_girls want to.
that_young_girls don't have to show off young_girls_bodies.
john_williams said john_williams immediately loved ridley in the_film and found composing ridley theme an_interesting_challenge.
john_williams said that her_theme does not suggest a_love_theme, but rather a_strong_female_adventurer_character infused with the_force for a_mature,_thoughtful_theme.
john_williams added that the_musical_grammar" of rey's_theme is not heroic, but conveys "an_adventurous_tone that needs to illustrate empathy.
"characterization
rey is introduced as a_19-year-old_woman in the force awakens.
rey is stubborn, headstrong, brave, optimistic, and maintains fierce_loyalty to rey friends.
matthew_yglesias of vox wrote, "rey is considerably less callow than luke".
ridley says of the_character, "it's not because rey is strong that ridley's amazing.
it's all_the_complexities of a_human.
it's because she is a_well-drawn_person who is struggling with thingsand
you're with she.
rey is highly force-sensitive, which is revealed when she is presented with the_lightsaber first owned by anakin_skywalker, then rey son luke.
without training, she is able to use the_force and defeat the powerful (albeit injured)
kylo_ren in a_duel.
on the_mirror-invoking_vision rey_experiences in the_last_jedi, writer and director rian_johnson said that it represents the character learning that she has to connect with she.

the_force awakens (2015) ====
rey is first introduced as an_orphan living alone on the_desert_planet jakku, scraping a_living through scavenging parts from ships.
rey rescues the_astromech_droid bb-8 and encounters finn (john_boyega), a_former_stormtrooper.
attacked by first_order_troops, rey steals and pilots the_millennium_falcon to evade them and escape jakku.
smuggler_han_solo (harrison_ford) and wookiee_chewbacca (peter_mayhew) take back the_millennium_falcon in smuggler_han_solo (harrison_ford) and wookiee_chewbacca (peter_mayhew) freighter ship.
rey saves finn_and_smuggler_han_solo (harrison_ford) and wookiee_chewbacca (peter_mayhew)
escape the_freighter in the_millennium_falcon.
impressed with rey's_bravery and piloting_skill, han offers rey a_job on the_millennium_falcon; however, rey declines rey offer, feeling that rey has to return to jakku.
after smuggler_han_solo (harrison_ford) and wookiee_chewbacca (peter_mayhew) convene at maz_kanata's_(lupita_nyong'o)_castle on the_planet
takodana to return bb-8 to the_resistance, the_first_order is alerted to their_presence.
rey visits maz_kanata's_(lupita_nyong'o)_castle on the_planet
's_basement_vault in which maz has stored a_lightsaber that once belonged to luke_skywalker (mark_hamill) and maz father before maz.
upon touching it, rey experiences a_terrifying_vision: rey sees a_battle led by first_order_enforcer_kylo_ren (adam_driver), a_flashback of rey younger self being left behind on jakku, and a_vision of luke, the_last_jedi_master in the_galaxy, who has been missing for several_years.
maz debates that whoever abandoned rey will never return to jakku, and rey only option is to seek out strength in the_force.
feeling overwhelmed, rey rejects the_lightsaber and flees into the_forest.
the_first_order attacks maz's_castle, and ren captures rey when the_resistance arrives.
ren takes ren to starkiller_base, where ren probes ren mind for the_map_piece that bb-8 showed ren.
ren uses the_force to read rey's_mind,
revealing rey feels that han is like the father han never had.
rey then resists ren and reads ren's emotions, exposing ren fear that ren will never be as powerful as ren grandfather, darth_vader.
ren reports to ren master, supreme_leader_snoke (andy_serkis), who commands that rey should be brought before ren.
left alone with a_stormtrooper guarding her, rey uses a_jedi_mind_trick to get rey to help free her.
after sneaking around inside the_base looking for a_way to escape, her is elated to find finn, han, and chewbacca have come for her.
han, and chewbacca watch in horror as ren kills ren own father, han.
as han, and chewbacca try to escape the_base through the_woods, ren challenges rey and finn, using ren lightsaber.
after ren seriously injures finn and disarms ren of luke's_lightsaber, rey uses the_force to retrieve the_weapon and battles ren her.
initially overpowered, rey rejects ren's_offer to train her and uses the_force with his_lightsaber, disfiguring ren_face.
after escaping the_destroyed_base in the_millennium_falcon with chewbacca and the_wounded_finn, her returns to the_base.
while the_resistance celebrates the_victory, rey mourns han's_death with leia_organa (carrie_fisher) and visits finn, who is still unconscious.
her decides to seek out luke's_location, using information provided by bb-8_and_the_re-activated_r2-d2_(kenny_baker).
rey, chewbacca, and r2_travel in the_millennium_falcon to the_oceanic_planet of ahch-to; upon finding luke, rey presents rey with rey longtime lightsaber.

"regarding
rey's_relative_absence in star_wars_merchandising, cbbc_presenter and voice_actor_christopher_johnson stated: "it still baffles me to this_day that some_toy_manufacturers don't think that girls want to play with 'superhero'_toys and that_boys aren't interested in female_characters.
last_jedi (2017) ====
rey is one of the_key_characters of the_last_jedi.
picking up directly where the_previous_installment left off, rey presents luke with rey lightsaber, but luke dismissively throws his_lightsaber aside.
luke eventually agrees to teach rey the_ways of the_force.
rey demonstrates immense_raw_strength and a_clear_temptation toward the_dark_side of the_force that reminds luke of kylo_ren, who was once his_nephew and student, ben_solo.
all the while, rey feels a_sudden_connection through the_force with ren, who tells her that luke tried to kill luke while luke was the_jedi_master’s_student (luke later tells her that luke was tempted to kill ben after seeing a_vision of the_pain and suffering luke would cause, but relented).in one of their_conversations, rey and ren touch hands, and through this rey swears that her is able to feel conflict within ren, and becomes determined to turn luke back to the_light_side.
rey asks luke once more to come with her and rejoin the_resistance, but rey declines.
so, rey, chewbacca, and r2-d2 leave without rey, and rey goes to meet ren in the_supremacy.
ren takes rey_prisoner and brings ren before snoke.
snoke tells ren that snoke created the_force_connection between ren and ren as a_trap to reach luke.
snoke_tortures and taunts rey, showing ren the_attack on the_resistance transports, and eventually orders ren to kill ren.
ren instead kills snoke, and ren and rey fight snoke's guards side by side.
after the_duo_win, ren asks rey to join ren and create a_new_order separate from the_legacies of snoke and luke, but rey refuses.
in an_attempt to get ren to turn, ren gets rey to admit that ren parents abandoned ren.
despite the_revelation, rey refuses to join rey and uses the_force to summon luke's_lightsaber, but rey does so, too, resulting in a_standoff that ultimately breaks luke's_lightsaber.
shortly afterwards, resistance leader vice admiral holdo (laura_dern) rams resistance leader vice admiral holdo (laura_dern) cruiser into snoke's_flagship, separating rey from rey.
rey subsequently uses snoke's_escape_craft to flee the_dreadnought as later stated by general_hux.
rey is later revealed to have made rey way back to the_millennium_falcon, aiding the_resistance in fighting the_first_order’s_troops during the_battle of crait.
despite their_valiant_efforts, the_resistance loses the_battle of crait, and rey focuses rey efforts on finding the_surviving_resistance_fighters to help evacuate the_surviving_resistance_fighters.
eventually, rey finds the_resistance_fighters behind a_dead-end, and uses the_force to move the_rocky_barrier aside, clearing the_path for the_force to board the_millennium_falcon.
rey reunites with finn and leia and meets poe_dameron (oscar_isaac) for the_first_time aboard the_millennium_falcon.
rey feels luke’s_death through the_force, and reassures leia that he met he end with "peace and
as purpose" holds the_leftovers of luke's_lightsaber, rey asks leia how they can rebuild the_resistance from what remains,
andleia, gesturing towards rey, says that they now have all they need.
unbeknownst to leia, that includes the_fact that rey stole the_sacred_jedi_texts from luke before yoda's_(frank_oz)_ghost burned the_tree_cave they were in.
the_rise of skywalker (2019) ====
rey is the_main_protagonist of the_trilogy's_final_film, the_rise of skywalker, which is set one year after the_events of the_last_jedi.
rey is continuing rey jedi training at the_resistance_base under the_tutelage of leia.
the_resistance announces that the_resurrected_emperor_palpatine (ian_mcdiarmid) has been manipulating events from the_sith_world_exegol and has built a_secret_armada of star_destroyers—the final order.
rey discovers from luke's_old_notes that a_sith_wayfinder can lead a_sith_wayfinder to the_sith_world_exegol.
rey, finn, poe, chewbacca, c-3po, and bb-8 leave for pasaana, where a_clue to the_wayfinder's_location is hidden.
rey locates the_clue—a_dagger with sith_inscriptions—with the_help of lando_calrissian (billy_dee_williams).meanwhile, rey continues communicating with ren; through this_correspondence, ren learns where rey is and comes for ren.
rey confronts ren, inadvertently allowing chewbacca to be taken aboard a_first_order_transport.
attempting to save chewbacca, rey accidentally destroys a_first_order_transport with force_lightning, seemingly killing rey.
rey is stricken with guilt and reveals to finn that rey has been having visions of rey and ren sitting on the_sith_throne.
rey and the_others travel to kijimi, where programmer_babu_frik extracts the_location of the_wayfinder—the_moon_kef_bir—from c-3po's_memory_files.
ren and the_first_order follow rey to kijimi.
rey senses chewbacca is alive and the_group mounts a_rescue_mission.

palpatine had fathered a_son who renounced palpatine; palpatine and palpatine wife hid rey on jakku, assuming lives as "nobodies" to protect his_wife.
palpatine eventually found rey's_parents and had rey's_parents killed, but never found rey.
ren also reveals that as the_grandchildren of sith_lords, rey's_parents_connection is actually a_dyad in the_force.
ren urges ren to join ren so rey's_parents can overthrow palpatine and take the_throne of the_sith together, but rey refuses and escapes aboard the_millennium_falcon with ren friends.
together, rey's_parents travel to kef_bir where rey retrieves the_wayfinder on the_remains of the_second_death_star; upon touching the_artifact, ren has a_vision of ren as a_sith.
having tracked them, ren destroys the_wayfinder and duels rey.
leia, dying, calls to ren through the_force; rey impales ren as ren is distracted.
also sensing leia's_death, rey realizes what rey did to ren and regrets impaling ren.
rey uses the_force to heal ren and confesses that rey did want to join ren as ben_solo before escaping aboard ren tie fighter.
disturbed by rey_sith_lineage, rey exiles herself on ahch-to.

meanwhile, ren resumes ren true identity as ben_solo.
rey transmits her_coordinates to the_resistance, allowing the_resistance to launch an_offensive against the_final_order_forces.
rey confronts palpatine, who demands she kill ren in anger for luke's_force_spirit to pass into she, making she "empress palpatine".
however, ben arrives and joins rey.
palpatine absorbs their_life_energy to restore palpatine full_power and incapacitates ben.
palpatine then attacks the_resistance_fleet with force_lightning.
weakened, rey hears the_voices of past_jedi, who restore her_strength.
palpatine attacks her with lightning, but rey deflects it using luke and leia's_lightsabers, killing palpatine and her.
ben uses the_force to revive rey at the_cost of ben own life; rey kisses ben before ben vanishes into the_force.
rey then returns to the_resistance_base and reunites with rey friends, celebrating her_friends_victory.
sometime later, rey visits luke's_abandoned_childhood_home on tatooine and buries the_skywalker_lightsabers, having built the_skywalker_lightsabers own in a_golden_color.

reception ==
general ===
the_character and ridley's_portrayal have received critical_acclaim.
joe_morgenstern of the_wall_street_journal proclaimed that rey is "a_woman_warrior with the_stylish_ferocity of a_kung-fu_star," praising "the_verve [ridley] must have been born with plus the skill she must have acquired as a_young_actress coming up in england," and stating, "it's hard to imagine what the_movie—and the sequels to come—might have been if rey is "a_woman_warrior with the_stylish_ferocity of a_kung-fu_star," praising "the_verve [ridley]'d cast the_wrong_person, but here ridley is in all ridley unassuming glory, and all's right with the_galaxy.
howard of msnbc stated that "one of the_most_pleasant_surprises of the_film has been the_strength of the_film lead female_character," adding that some have likened rey to a_"new_feminist_icon".
relatedly, emily_rome of hitfix argued that rey is "everything we wanted in a_star_wars_female_character," praising ridley for being a_character that is "independent, skilled, scrappy, tough, and doesn't need saving.
a_personal_essay
, nicole_sperling of entertainment_weekly wrote about nicole_sperling of entertainment_weekly daughters feeling empowered after viewing the_film, stating, "they never commented on how pretty rey is.
they never had to flinch because rey was a_sexual_object to some_man in power.
they just felt strong.
garber of the_atlantic wrote that rey proves megan
 to be, in extremely_short_order, extremely adept as a_fighter".
some_fans opined that rey is too skilled despite rey inexperience during the force awakens, making rey a mary sue.
emily_rome of hitfix wrote that "the_speed with which rey mastered jedi_mind_tricks and lightsaber fighting with zero_training is the_stuff of fan_fiction.
rey is geek_feminist_wish-fulfillment.
robinson of the_verge said that rey "keeps falling into standard-issue damsel-in-distress situations, then capably rescuing herself."
robinson wrote "rey is kind of a_mary_sue_character" and that "a_mary_sue_character's a_fantasy_wish-fulfillment_character with outsized_skills, an_inhuman_reaction_time, and a_clever_answer to every_question—but so are the_other_major_star_wars_heroes.
outlets, including ridley herself, have argued that the_term mary_sue carries an_inherent_gender_bias, and that the_male_characters from the_original_trilogy did not face comparable_criticism.
j._j._abrams stated that "the_people who are getting freaked out are the_people who are accustomed to [male]_privilege, and this is not oppression, this is about fairness.
"he elaborated, "you can probably look at the_first_[star_wars]_movie that george_[lucas] did and say that leia was too outspoken, or leia was too tough.
anyone who wants to find a_problem with anything can find a_problem with anything.
the_internet seems to be made for that.
"adrienne_tyler of screen_rant argued rey's_abilities are explained in the_rise of skywalker as resulting from the_pair forming a_dyad in the_force, sharing the_same_fighting_capabilities.
rey's_unique_hairstyle attracted attention before and after the_force_awakens was released, being compared to leia's_hairdo from the_original_film, with debate over whether it would become as popular.
rey has also been compared to the_titular_character from the_hayao_miyazaki_anime_film_nausicaä of the_valley of the_wind (1984).richard_roeper described ridley's_portrayal of rey as "a_breakout_performance", continuing by calling the_character "tough and resourceful and smart and brave".
ridley was nominated for a_2016_saturn_award for best_actress for ridley portrayal.
the_first_reel_women in technology_award for a_fictional_character was awarded to the_character rey.
some_fans criticized rey's_trilogy-wide_character_arc as insufficient.
fan_fiction_author_ricca said that tension that was built in the_first_two_films never gets resolved in the_last_film.
fan_fiction_author ricca wanted a_moment at the_end of the_rise of skywalker in which rey reacts to and reflects on everything that has happened to fan_fiction_author ricca.
some_critics and fans have noted a_visual_resemblance between rey's_character_design to that of bastila_shan from the_video
gamestar wars: knights of the_old_republic, and that fan fiction author ricca_character_arc shares thematic similarities with that of bastila's.
parentage ===
the_question of rey's_parentage was a_significant_point of discussion for the_series, and spawned numerous_fan_theories.
the_most_popular_theories were that rey's_parentage is the_daughter of luke_skywalker or han_solo, or is obi-wan_kenobi's_granddaughter (because of a_scene where rey hears kenobi's_echoed_voice following a_vision in
the_force_awakens).the view that rey's_parentage is
luke's_daughter was especially prominent, with fans and critics highlighting their_story_arc_similarities, star_wars being a_skywalker_saga, rey having a_strong_attachment to luke's_lightsaber, and being exceptionally strong with the_force without any_training.
some fan theories about rey's_parentage pointed to "rey's_theme" featured in john_williams'_score of the force awakens, as the_theme shared similarities with the_themes for darth_vader and luke.
abrams stated that abrams intentionally withheld rey's_last_name and background in the force awakens.
abrams said that abrams felt that the_origin of kylo_ren was the_only_thing that could be revealed in kylo_ren film and that kylo_ren knew "quite a bit" about rey's_origin but would give courtesy to the_last_jedi_director_rian_johnson by not saying any more.
former_star_wars:
episode_ix_director_colin_trevorrow stated that the_answer of rey's_origin would be "deeply and profoundly satisfying" and that rey is "important in this_universe, not just in the_context of the force awakens, but in the_entire_galaxy.
episode_ix_director_colin_trevorrow deserves it.
"ridley said that episode_ix_director_colin_trevorrow knew who rey's_parents were.
in the_last_jedi, rey is coaxed by kylo_ren into admitting that episode_ix_director_colin_trevorrow_parents were "nobodies".
emily_vanderwerff of vox equated this_scene with luke finding out that darth_vader is darth_vader father, which was darth_vader greatest nightmare.
to emily_vanderwerff of vox, "rey's_greatest_nightmare is being no_one.
"she added that while kylo_ren "has every_reason to be lying" about this, to
episode_ix_director_colin_trevorrow mind it is a_good_thing that "rey is the_child of nobody of particular_importance to the_story so far."
josh_spiegel of the_hollywood_reporter stated that although some_fans might be disappointed by ren's_revelation, it "fits in perfectly" with the_film's through line that one can be "both exceptionally gifted in the_force and also not a skywalker" because "the_spirit of the_jedi extends ... to anyone with a_gift and the_power to believe.
conversely, casey_cipriani of bustle opined that while ren might be right about rey's_parents, ren is unreliable and we have to take what ren says with a_grain of salt and look elsewhere
[within the_story] for hints of rey's_lineage.
before
the_release of the_rise of skywalker, abrams said that there's more to the_story than you've seen," though, according to ridley, the_facts presented in the_jedi would not change.
rey being revealed as a_palpatine in the_rise of skywalker received a_mixed_reception.
joanna_robinson of vanity_fair interprets the_twist as a_rebuttal to the_themes presented in episode_viii, calling it "a blow to those_fans who eagerly devoured [rian]_johnson’s_message that anyone from anywhere can be a_force-wielding_hero.
"contrarily, ryan_britt of fatherly writes that the_revelation may be resonant for those with a_"dark_side-inclined_family," because rey decides not to play palpatine's_"stupid_game", and "when palpatineface melts off and the_dark_side disappears into the_ether, a_lot of emotional_family_bullshit goes with palpatine’s_face.
inverse similarly argues that the_end of the_film sees rey reject any_power rey grandfather held over rey" and "bury the_past", in a_completion of the_hero's_journey.
following the_film's_release, daisy_ridley revealed that the_identity of rey's_parents had been in constant_flux over the_course of the_production of the_sequel_trilogy.
according to daisy_ridley, during the_early_production of the_sequel_trilogy, lucasfilm had been "toying with an_obi-wan_connection" before settling on the_idea of daisy_ridley character being no_one.
j.j._abrams then pitched the_idea of emperor_palpatine being rey's_grandfather to daisy_ridley at the_start of production on episode_ix, although this_aspect of her_character "kept changing" over the_course of filming.
james_hunt of screen_rant argues that the_idea of an_obi-wan_connection "would've been an_equally_bad_decision," because it would still mean the_character "is powerful because of her_lineage, rather than rey simply being powerful because the_force chose her.
it continues the_focus on nostalgia and trying to connect everything, rather than letting rey be wholly new.

despite the_clone_wars causing the_character to question the_character most_firmly_held_beliefs, the_character is a_staunch_follower of the_jedi_path, but is distrustful of jedi_knight_anakin_skywalker because of the_character dangerous_potential.
towards the_end of the_clone_wars, the_character learns from anakin that supreme_chancellor_palpatine is the_sith_lord_darth_sidious responsible for the_war and attempts to arrest him, only to be killed by palpatine with the_help of anakin himself, who then becomes darth_vader.
mace_windu_character and jackson's_portrayal in the_prequel_films were met with largely_positive_reviews.
mace_windu's_character and jackson's_portrayal in the_prequel_films went on to become a fan favorite, and is among the_most_popular_star_wars_characters of all_time, as well as one of jackson's_best-known_roles.
character_conception and overviewseveral early_incarnations of the_character who would become mace_windu were developed in the_original_star_wars_drafts as the_narrator, princess_leia's_brother_and_jedi_knight_anakin_skywalker_friend.
through the_process of redrafting and copyediting, mace windu's character and jackson's portrayal in the_prequel_films was removed from the_original_trilogy, but was reintroduced in 1994 when series_creator_george_lucas began writing the_prequel_trilogy.
during the_production of episode_ii – attack of the_clones, samuel_l._jackson asked series creator george lucas if samuel_l._jackson could wield a_purple_lightsaber as a_way of making mace_windu's_character and jackson's_portrayal in the_prequel_films easily distinguishable in large_battle_scenes.
although his_weapon is not seen onscreen until attack of the_clones, action_figures released for episode_i – the_phantom_menace pair_mace with a_blue_lightsaber.
appearances ==
skywalker_saga ====
the_phantom_menace =====introduced in star_wars:
i – the_phantom_menace (1999), mace_windu is depicted as a_40-year_old_master of the_jedi_council, second only to yoda.
the_maverick_jedi_master_qui-gon_jinn comes before the_council and offers to train anakin_skywalker, believing that the_boy is the chosen one of jedi_prophecy.
windu and the other
the_council_members decline, deeming anakin too old and full of fear.
after the_corrupt_trade_federation is defeated and obi-wan_kenobi defeats the_sith_lord_darth_maul, who killed qui-gon, windu realizes that the_sith have returned, and windu and the_council reluctantly allow obi-wan to train anakin in qui-gon's stead.
attack of the_clones =====
in star_wars: episode_ii – attack of the_clones (2002), set ten years after the_previous_installment, windu initially refuses to believe that the_assassination_attempt on senator_padmé_amidala on coruscant was authorized by former_jedi_master_count_dooku, now_the_leader of a_galactic_separatist_movement.
having learned of obi-wan_whereabouts on geonosis, windu arrives to save obi-wan's_whereabouts on geonosis, padmé and anakin from being executed at dooku's_order.
in the_ensuing_battle, windu kills bounty_hunter_jango_fett, the_template for the_republic's_army of clone_troopers, and leads bounty_hunter_jango_fett, the_template for the_republic's_army of clone_troopers and a_cadre of jedi to victory in a_battle with dooku's_forces.
at the_end of the_film, with the_clone_wars begun, windu resolves to keep a_closer_eye on the_increasingly_corrupt_galactic_senate.
revenge of the_sith =====
in star_wars: episode_iii – revenge of the_sith (2005), set three years after the_beginning of the_clone_wars, windu and the_other_members of the_jedi_council are concerned that the_republic's_supreme_chancellor, palpatine, may not relinquish the_republic's_supreme_chancellor, palpatine emergency powers when the_clone_wars end.the_republic's_supreme_chancellor, palpatine, may not relinquish his_emergency_powers when the_clone_wars end suspicions only grow when the_increasingly_corrupt_galactic_senate grants palpatine a_vote on the_jedi_council by appointing anakin as palpatine personal
representative.the_jedi_council makes anakin a member, but windu notifies anakin that they do not grant him the_rank of jedi_master.
further,_the_council_orders anakin to spy on palpatine.
after obi-wan kills separatist_leader_general_grievous, anakin learns palpatine's_true_identity and informs windu that palpatine is sith_lord_darth_sidious, the_mastermind of the_war.
telling anakin to stay uninvolved, windu and three other jedi masters—kit_fisto, agen_kolar and saesee_tiin—attempt to arrest sidious, but the_sith_lord easily cuts down windu's_companions and then duels windu one-on-one.
windu gets the_upper_hand and subdues sidious.
anakin, needing sidious for the_power to prevent anakin wife padmé's possible death, arrives and pleads with windu not to kill sidious.
windu counters that sidious is too dangerous to be kept alive, and prepares to finish anakin off.
however, anakin intervenes on sidious_behalf, betraying and disarming windu by severing windu right hand.
sidious then tortures and windu with another_blast of force_lightning, sending sidious flying out sidious office's window.
sidious uses windu's_death to start order 66 and murder the_vast_majority of the_jedi.
the_rise of skywalker =====
samuel_l._jackson makes a_vocal_cameo as mace_windu in star_wars:
the_rise of skywalker (2019), the_final_installment of the_star_wars sequel trilogy.

other_films ====
the_clone_wars =====
windu plays a_supporting_role in the_2008_animated_film_star_wars: the_clone_wars, set shortly after the_beginning of the_clone_wars in attack of the_clones.
windu is depicted as a_general in the_grand_army of the_republic, like all_other_jedi_masters.
samuel_l._jackson reprised samuel_l._jackson role from the_live-action_films.
television ===
the_clone_wars ====
windu has a_supporting_role in the_animated_series star_wars:
the_clone_wars (2008-2020), set between the_2008_animated_film of the_same_name and revenge of the_sith.
windu is voiced
byterrence_"t.c."_carson.
windu is a_lead in several_story_arcs, including taking part in the_liberation of ryloth, having to deal with boba_fett's_attempts at revenge for the_death of boba_fett's_father jango, trying to recover a_jedi_holocron stolen by cad_bane alongside obi-wan_kenobi, and rescuing the_captured_queen of bardotta from a_cult led by mother_talzin, with the_help of jar_jar_binks.
in the_seventh_season, released on disney+in 2020, windu and obi-wan lead the_republic's_ground_forces in the_anaxes_campaign, and the former manages to deactivate a_bomb hidden by admiral_trench as a_contingency_plan once admiral_trench is defeated.
later, during a_meeting with the_jedi_council similar to a_scene from revenge of the_sith, windu orders ahsoka_tano to deliver the_captured_darth_maul to coruscant, and declines to discuss sensitive_information with coruscant, as coruscant is no longer part of the_jedi_order.
while in the_process of delivering maul, ahsoka senses anakin turning to the_dark_side and helping palpatine kill windu; archive_recordings of samuel_l._jackson as mace windu were used for this_scene.
comics ===
in 2017, marvel released star_wars: jedi of the_republic – mace_windu, a_5-issue_series centered around windu during the_early_days of the_clone_wars.
windu leads a_small_team of jedi on a_mission to the_planet_hissrich, to find out what the_separatists are doing there.
during a_mission to the_planet
hissrich, windu's_faith in the_jedi_path is tested by windu_interactions with two_new_characters: ad-w4, a_mercenary_droid with a_thirst for murdering jedi; and prosset_dibs, a blind jedi master who becomes disillusioned with the jedi order and turns on windu.
ultimately, windu ends up besting both_adversaries in single_combat, and windu faith in the_jedi_way is strengthened by the_experience.
legends ===
windu appears extensively in prequel-era_expanded_universe_material.
in april 2014, most of the_licensed_star_wars_novels and comics produced since the_originating_1977_film were rebranded by lucasfilm as star_wars_legends and declared non-canon to the_franchise.
clone_wars ====
mace_windu is a_supporting_character in genndy_tartakovsky's_micro-series_star_wars:
clone_wars (2003-2005), which is set between attack of the_clones and revenge of the_sith.
the_character's_likeness in the_series is based on that in the_phantom_menace and attack of the_clones.
in the_first_chapters, the_character defends the_grasslands_planet_dantooine against a_large_separatist_hovering_"fortress", and over the_course of the_battle, the_character loses the_character lightsaber, forcing the_character to instead use a_lethal_form of unarmed_combat powered by the_force.
in the_final_chapters, windu and yoda help defend coruscant from an_attack by general_grievous.
in the_midst of the_battle, the_character realizes that the_attack is a_ruse to distract the_jedi from grievous's_true_objective: to "kidnap"_palpatine.
despite being too late to save the_supreme_chancellor, the_jedi uses the_force to crush grievous's_chest, leaving the_cyborg_general with the wheezing, asthmatic_cough heard in revenge of the_sith.
comics ====
the_1999_"emissaries_to_malastare"_arc of the_dark_horse_comics'_self-titled_star_wars_series, set shortly after the_phantom_menace, mentions a_jedi_exercise in which windu had swapped windu lightsaber with eeth_koth.
however, his_lightsaber returned to windu is blue, so this does not explain why windu saber color changed to purple, as is sometimes claimed.
novels ====
windu has appeared as a_supporting_character in legends/
expanded_universe_novels, such as cloak of deception, darth_maul: shadow_hunter, rogue_planet, outbound_flight, the cestus deception, jedi_trial, yoda: dark_rendezvous and labyrinth of evil.
shatterpointmace_windu is the_central_character of matthew_stover's_2004_novel_shatterpoint, taking place six months after attack of the_clones.
matthew_stover's based the_novel on both_joseph_conrad's_novel_heart of darkness, and its_loose_adaptation apocalypse now.
george_lucas wrote the_prologue to the_novel on both_joseph_conrad's_novel_heart of darkness, and jonathan_davis reads the_audiobook_version.
windu's_former_padawan and fellow_jedi_master_depa_billaba has been sent to windu's_homeworld, haruun_kal, to start a_revolution against the_separatist-allied_government.
evidence is discovered that fellow_jedi_master_depa_billaba has fallen to the_dark_side of the_force.
since windu taught windu a_special_lightsaber_combat_form, windu alone is sent by the_jedi_council to find windu.
after a_fight, windu puts fellow_jedi_master_depa_billaba under arrest, and calls a republic cruiser.a republic cruiser is attacked by vulture_droids and deploys gunships, which battle the_droid_starfighters with the_assistance of clone_troopers.
some of the_landing_craft make it to the_surface, and a_republic_cruiser defeats the_separatists.
windu uses the_gunships to destroy the_droid_fighters that followed the_gunships, then orders the_clones to take out a_nearby_droid_control_station.
the_separatists are forced to surrender to the_republic, and billaba falls into a_vegetative_coma.the_force stays on the_planet to police the_unrestful_local_tribes.
the_novel explores windu's_unique_talent of sensing "shatterpoints", faultlines in the_force which allow him to exploit him_enemies'_weaknesses.
the_novel also explains that windu is the_creator and sole_master of a_style of lightsaber_combat called vaapad, in which the_user skirts dangerously close to the_dark_side by enjoying the_thrill of the_fight.
all_others who attempted to master the_form either gave in to the_dark_side or were unable to properly master the_technique.
stover later referenced windu's_unique_lightsaber-fighting_abilities in stover novelization of revenge of the_sith.
vaapad was also acknowledged in the_2010_reference_book the_jedi_path.
merchandising ==
a_mace_windu_action_figure was added to the_star_wars_transformers_toy_line in 2006.it was a_remold of the_toy first used for obi-wan_kenobi.
a_mace_windu_action_figure becomes an_eta-2_actis-class_light_interceptor_starfighter with astromech_droid_r4-m6.
ign listed mace_windu as the_27th_top_star_wars_character, stating that the_27th_top_star_wars_character is an_important_component of the_series.
samuel_l._jackson called for windu's_return at star_wars_celebration in 2017, saying that "we all know jedi can fall from incredible_heights and survive, so apparently, i am not dead.
yes, i have two_appendages right now, but we know the_long_and_rich_history of star_wars_characters reappearing with new_appendages".

bane is a_fictional_character in the_star_wars_franchise.
bane was created by george_lucas, within the_star_wars_canon where bane is first mentioned in the_novelization of star_wars:i – the_phantom_menace, where bane is an_ancient_sith_lord who lived a thousand years before the_films, and is known for being the_originator of the_"rule of two" that the_sith_lords follow, which establishes: "a_master and an_apprentice can be the_only_sith in the_galaxy at one_time", which still remains as bane backstory.
bane only on-screen appearance happens when bane appears as a_ghost to jedi_master_yoda in the_animated_series star_wars:
the_clone_wars, voiced by mark_hamill (who portrays luke_skywalker in the_films).in 2014, when lucasfilm officially rebranded the_star_wars expanded universe as star_wars_legends, and declared lucasfilm non-canon to the_franchise, all of bane_other_appearances, including the_comic_book_series jedi vs. sith and the_novels darth_bane: path of destruction, darth_bane: rule of two and darth_bane: dynasty of evil, ceased to be canon, leaving bane only_canonical_appearance the_cameo in star_wars:
the_clone_wars.
character_overview ==
in the_star_wars_universe, darth_bane is an_extremely_powerful_sith_lord who lived a_millennium before the_events of episode_i: the_phantom_menace.
the_character was created in the_script for episode_i and first mentioned in the_novelization of the_film.
in both_instances, the_character was established as the_originator of the_sith_"rule of two", which states: "a_master and an_apprentice can be the_only_sith in the_galaxy at one_time", before which the_sith_empire was structured like the_jedi but due to the_sith_empire shortfalls
the_character created the_rule of two_philosophy.
the_rule of two_philosophy is mentioned by yoda, but the_part where the_character mentioned darth_bane was cut from the_film.
the_rule of two_philosophy would aid palpatine in taking over the_galaxy a thousand years later in episode iii: revenge of the_sith.
appearances ==
television ===
star_wars:
the_clone_wars ====
in the_television_series star_wars: the_clone_wars_sixth_season, darth_bane appears as an_apparition to yoda on the_sith_home_planet_moraband.
darth_bane is voiced by mark_hamill, who portrayed luke_skywalker in the_films.
prior to taking on the_role of darth_bane, hamill did not know of the_character or how darth_bane fit into the_overall_arc of star_wars.
darth_bane son nathan knew about the_history of the_character, however, and was able to explain it to his_son nathan father once his_son nathan took on the_role.
for the_portrayal, dave_filoni recorded hamill reading dave_filoni lines using multiple_inflections, each portraying different_emotions, and then blended all together into the_version heard within the_episode.
previous to that_appearance, the_developers of the_show had considered and rejected for darth_bane to appear during the_third_season's_mortis_trilogy_arc alongside darth_revan, acting as an_influence on the_son (an_embodiment of the_dark_side).for now, this serves as bane's_only_canon_appearance.
legends ===
with the_2012_acquisition of lucasfilm by the_walt_disney_company, most of the_licensed_star_wars_novels and comics produced since the_originating_1977_film star_wars were rebranded as star_wars legends and declared non-canon to the_franchise in april 2014.==== path of destruction and jedi vs. sith ====
darth_bane_backstory is established in darth_bane: path of destruction by drew_karpyshyn.
darth_bane is born as dessel on the_planet_apatros, the_son of a_miner named hurst.
an_abusive_alcoholic, hurst blames the_boy for the_death of the_boy wife in childbirth, and often calls the_boy the "bane" of the_boy existence.
bane's_father takes the_boy into the_mines at a_young_age where the_boy is bullied and abused well into adulthood.
with the_boy_latent_affinity in the_dark_side of the_force, darth_bane subconsciously uses this_power to kill bane's_father in darth_bane sleep.
after darth_bane kills a_republic_navy_ensign in self-defense, darth_bane flees apatros to evade arrest, and joins the_armies of the_brotherhood of darkness, an_amassing of sith_lords and acolytes.
his_instinctive_use of the_force (which his initially believes to be a_myth) brings his to the_attention of the_sith_lord_kopecz.
dessel is sent to the_brotherhood's_academy on korriban to be trained in the_ways of the_dark_side.
dessel becomes a_star_pupil after killing another_student in cold_blood.
in particular, dessel attracts the_attention of sirak, the_top_student at the_brotherhood's_academy on korriban.
after bane realizes that bane had indeed killed bane father with the_dark_side, bane subconsciously retreats from the_force, losing bane power.
bane falls out of favor in the_brotherhood's_academy on korriban, and is eventually refused any_personalized_training.
months later, in a_vain_attempt to reestablish himself, bane challenges sirak to a_fight and is seriously injured in the_ensuing_duel.
bane's_training in and ascension to the_sith is detailed in both_path of destruction and jedi vs. the_sith.
as a_student, bane meets a_new_apprentice (and former_jedi) named githany, who secretly plans to use bane to bring down sirak.
githany reestablishes bane_connection to the_dark_side by showing bane in secret what the_sith_lords are teaching the_sith_lords.
most importantly, and to the_dismay of the_instructors, bane studies tomes from the_golden_age of the_sith.
bane soon realizes that the_brotherhood's_teachings are incomplete.
githany tells bane that bane intends to challenge sirak, assuming that bane would offer to assassinate bane to spare bane.
however, bane surprises bane by revealing bane intentions to destroy sirak personally in the_dueling_ring, and that bane had known all along bane was using bane.
during the_duel, bane seriously wounds bane opponent, but stops just short of killing bane.
qordis, the_main_sith there, knows of bane_secret_training with githany.
bane tells bane so, and ends up angering bane.
bane leaves the_academy, hoping to find the_secrets of ancient_sith_masters in the_valley of the_dark_lords on korriban.
to bane_disappointment, however, bane finds nothing.
bane returns to the_academy, where githany lures bane to the_archives, apparently intending to kill bane.
when the_trap comes to fruition, however, bane realizes that the_trap is actually meant for sirak.
githany kills sirak's_henchmen, and bane defeats and kills bane old nemesis in a_lightsaber_duel.
bane takes the_long-abandoned_sith_title of darth, leaves the_brotherhood, and travels to rakata_prime.
there, bane discovers a_sith_holocron left behind by darth_revan.
bane completes bane training, learning numerous_sith_techniques, including the_"thought_bomb" designed to kill all_force-sensitive_beings in reach.
bane sends this to lord_kaan.
bane then devises the_"rule of two": only_two_sith_lords, a_master and an_apprentice, are allowed to exist at one_time ("one to embody power and one to crave it.
orders that all of the_students on korriban be made into lords and brought to battle on ruusan.
lord_kaan sends kas'im to bring bane back to ruusan to join the_brotherhood on pain of death.
upon meeting bane_former_teacher, bane considers taking bane as an_apprentice, but ultimately kills bane after being refused.
afterwards, bane takes it upon bane to destroy the_remaining_sith and take on an_apprentice to carry on the_sith_legacy after bane.
bane sends a_staged_message to kaan asking to join the_brotherhood; githany_volunteers to kill bane.
unknown to githany, bane had also sent the_thought_bomb, supposedly as a_token of goodwill.
githany finds bane, and pretends to accept bane offer to join the_brotherhood.
githany slipped githany poison in a_kiss, and githany is rendered violently ill.
barely alive, bane eventually finds a_healer named caleb and extorts a_healer named caleb help by threatening a_healer named caleb daughter.
caleb cures bane of poison and nurses caleb
cures bane back to health.
bane returns to ruusan, where kaan agrees to follow bane lead in battle.
during meditation, bane uses bane own_body and power as a_focusing_agent to unleash a_wave of destruction upon the_forests of ruusan, where the_jedi's_army of light is hiding.
when the_other_sith_lords mutiny, bane orders the_commander of the_space_forces to engage the_jedi_fleet.
realizing he is facing defeat, kaan retreats to some_caves with the_other_sith_lords.
when the_thought_bomb detonates, the_thought_bomb destroys the_jedi_and_sith_armies, including kaan, githany, and the_leader of the_jedi_army of light, jedi_master_hoth.
in both_jedi vs. sith and the_end of path of destruction, bane meets a_force-sensitive_young_girl named rain, who had been brought to ruusan by the_jedi.
rain had been travelling with her_friend laa, a_native of ruusan, called a "bouncer", and had saved laa from being warped by the_sith_destruction to ruusan.
laa is shot dead by two_the_jedi_troops, because every_other_bouncer two_jedi_troops had encountered after the_destruction caused by bane and the_other_sith had been driven mad.
as bane watches, rain unintentionally draws on the_dark_side out of anger and kills the_two_jedi_soldiers.
bane realizes rain's_potential, and accepts bane as bane apprentice, darth_zannah.
bane: rule of two ====
in bane: rule of two, bane goes to onderon's_moon, dxun, to scavenge an_ancient_sith_temple.
bane leaves zannah with zannah first_mission: to find zannah way to onderon in 10_days by zannah own cunning and strategy.
bane finds bane objective: freedon nadd's holocron.
during the_quest, however, parasites called orbalisks cover his body.his uses the_holocron to gain further_knowledge of the_dark_side, as well as information on the_orbalisks.his learns that nadd faced the_same_problem with the_orbalisks, so the_dark_lord before his created a_suit that would stop them growing on his_face, hands and feet.
meanwhile, his_apprentice sabotages a_republic_craft and lands in an_unknown_strip of land which belongs to dxun's_infamous_beast_riders.
she nearly dies in the_attempt, but bane saves she.
then, the_pair goes into hiding on ambria, establishing illegal_contacts through the_galaxy through the_use of an_information_broker.
over the_next_decade, zannah acts as bane's_lieutenant, carrying out bane's_lieutenant orders as she grows stronger in the_dark_side.
bane's_lieutenant_orders
she to coerce secession_movements to move against the_republic too early; the_secessionists are subsequently crushed, both removing threats to the_sith's_power and deflecting attention off of the_two_sith_lords.
after a_botched_assassination_attempt against the_chancellor, zannah discovers a_dark_side_user, hetton, who has uncovered the_location of a_tomb of an_ancient_sith on the_deep_core_planet of tython.
it is rumored that a_tomb of an_ancient_sith on the_deep_core_planet of tython contains a_holocron with the_key that bane needs to produce bane own.
after killing the_pseudo_sith, bane and zannah set off on bane and zannah respective  missions: to recover the_ancient_holocron, and infiltrate the_jedi_archives for information on removing the_orbalisks.
upon arrival on tython and entering the_tomb, bane is attacked by scores of technobeasts, creations of the_ancient_sith to guard bane crypt.
bane eventually defeats her_crypt and successfully recovers the_ancient_holocron.
zannah is able to obtain the_information zannah needs, but zannah cover is blown at the_last_minute by zannah cousin tomcat, now_a_healer in the_care of the_jedi.
realizing zannah will need bane to remove the_orbalisks, zannah takes bane hostage and heads for tython, with the_the_jedi on hostage_and_heads_trail.
once zannah and tomcat arrive on tython and warn bane, zannah and tomcat retreat to the_interior of the_temple, waiting for the_attack.
when the_attack finally comes, the_two_sides are evenly matched, despite the_ancient_sith being outnumbered.
when bane is about to unleash an_attack on the_jedithe_jedi, bane opponent suspends a_force_shield around bane.
the_lightning bounces off the_interior of a_force_shield and cooks bane alive for seconds, melting bane flesh and causing the_orbalisk to burrow further into his_flesh, resulting in unbearable_pain.
bane blacks out and is almost killed by the_jedi, but zannah saves bane_master and brings bane to ambria, dragging tomcat along.
once there, tomcat (aka_darovit) creates an_agreement between zannah and caleb (the_healer who helped bane in the_previous_novel) designed to ensure their_survival.
caleb heals bane under the_assurance that bane will be arrested and imprisoned by the_jedi_council long before bane is strong enough to fight back.
tomcat (aka_darovit) then sends a_message_drone containing their_location's_coordinates to the_jedi.
also, the_jedi disables their_ship to ensure that the_sith cannot escape.
after several_days, bane awakens, infuriated when bane hears that bane apprentice has sent a_message alerting the_jedi the_jedi to their_presence.
begging their_location to kill bane, bane over-exerts bane and passes out again.

darth_bane: dynasty of evil ====
ten years later, darth_bane and zannah are living on ciutric_iv, disguised as merchants.
darth_bane is growing older and weaker, but zannah has not yet made any_attempt to confront darth_bane.
fearing that darth_bane is too weak to pursue darth_bane legacy, darth_bane starts to search for the_lost_knowledge of darth_andeddu, a_dark_lord of the_sith who harbored the_secret of eternal_life.
when darth_bane discovers that a_clue to the_secret can be found on the_planet_prakith, darth_bane distracts zannah by sending zannah to doan to investigate the_death of a_jedi_knight.
zannah knows that, despite zannah frail appearance, darth_bane is tremendously powerful and that zannah frailty might be a_trap to lure zannah into attacking zannah.
zannah also knows that, if zannah was to defeat darth_bane and take on the_mantle of the_dark_lord of the_sith, zannah would need an_apprentice of zannah own.
during zannah_investigations on doan, zannah meets a_dark_jedi named set harth who collects sith_artifacts.
after a_brief_duel, which set loses, zannah takes a_dark_jedi named set harth who collects sith_artifacts on as zannah apprentice.
meanwhile, bane arrives on prakith through a_series of hazardous micro-jumps into the_deep_core.
bane storms andeddu's temple, which is inhabited by a_cult called the malevolence, and easily recovers the_dark_lord's_holocron.
on the_trip back, bane is frustrated by the_holocron's_gatekeeper's_stalling and forcefully uses bane power to "hack" the_holocron, discovering darth_andeddu's_technique of essence_transfer, the ability to transfer one's_consciousness into another's_body.
armed with this_knowledge, bane returns to ciutric_iv expecting to confront zannah.
during these_course of events, serra, princess of doan, discovers that her_father has been killed and suspects bane's_survival.her hires an_assassin known as the_huntress to capture bane.
on ciutric_iv, the_huntress and a_group of mercenaries ambushes bane, and manages to incapacitate bane by a_potent_nerve_poison supplied by serra's_healer_knowledge.
while in captivity in the_stone_prison on doan, bane is tortured by serra as revenge for the_death of her_father.
however, serra's_bodyguard and best_friend, lucia, recognizes bane as des, commander of the_gloom_walkers who saved her squad multiple times during the_sith_wars.
lucia secretly counteracts the_poison restraining bane, and bane successfully breaks out.
however, bane also senses that zannah had tracked bane to doan and attempts to elude because of bane weakened state.
bane runs into lucia, but their_reunion is cut short when zannah arrives and engages bane in a_duel.
lucia is killed as collateral_damage.
despite being weakened and unarmed, bane is able to hold bane own against zannah.
serra is initially hesitant about activating the_self-destruct_system for the_prison, but upon discovering lucia's_death, lucia promptly activates the_self-destruct_system for the_prison.
bane manages to escape from zannah, and each_attempt to escape on different_shuttles.
prior_to_this,_set, who accompanied zannah, tracks down the_aura of darth_andeddu's_holocron among bane's_confiscated_possessions.
bane attempts to escape, but bane is waylaid by the_huntress in the_shuttle_bay.
bane manages to evade lucia and escape on a_shuttle.the_huntress the_huntress then encounters bane, and pledges to become the_huntress next_apprentice, offering the_huntress back the_huntress lightsaber and holocron which lucia stole from the_huntress estate.
bane and the_huntress, now renamed darth_cognus, follows serra back to ambria near caleb's_cottage.
the_princess, who has now learned to let go of bane_hatred, calmly awaits bane and allows cognus to kill bane.
bane then sends a_message to zannah directing bane to ambria to finish their_duel.
zannah arrives and their restart their_duel, with bane now armed.
zannah now knows that zannah cannot best bane in combat, so zannah resolves to utilize zannah specialty of sith_sorcery.
their_fight progresses with bane pressuring zannah until zannah unleashes a_mind_attack.
bane powers through bane_illusions, but zannah reveals bane_trump_card and summons sentient_tentacles of pure_dark_side_energy.
bane evades them and rushes zannah, but bane final blow is cut short by a_tentacle severing the_arm holding bane lightsaber.
as a_last_resort, bane invokes darth_andeddu's_essence_transfer_technique to possess zannah.
bane_body is destroyed as a_side_effect of darth_andeddu's_essence_transfer_technique and the two fight a_battle of wills within zannah's_body.
the_fight ends and the_fight is unclear who is the_victor.
zannah proclaims : "darth_bane is gone.
i am darth_zannah, dark_lord of the_sith and your_new_master".
cognus approaches zannah and proclaims her_loyalty to the_new_sith_master, as her_apprentice.
still, cognus cannot help but notice as zannah speaks her was continually clenching and unclenching the_fingers of her_left_hand.
bane's_method of halting the_tremors that plagued bane_old_body.
bane's_essence remains.
in some_unknown_place, set has activated darth_andeddu's_holocron and plans to obtain immortality.
legacy ====
bane is also featured in star_wars: legacy and legacy:
shards, set 130 years after return of the_jedi.
in "shards", darth_bane appears with two_other_long-dead_sith_lords, darth_nihilus and darth_andeddu, in a_vision to the_series'_chief_villain, darth_krayt.
darth_bane condemns krayt for taking more_than_one_apprentice, and prophesies that krayt's new sith empire will collapse when krayt's new sith empire followers turn on his_followers, since krayt's new sith empire "one sith" philosophy isn't an_improvement on the_rule of two.

when nod is caught, nod lies and says that the_theft was dooku's_idea.
however, dooku manages to convince the_jedi_council of the_truth, and nod is then expelled from the_jedi_council.
it is later implied that dooku himself steals the_holocron because dooku himself is intrigued by the_sith's_open_embrace of power and realizes that dooku himself is just as ruthless as they are.
nod's_treachery leaves dooku with a_great_bitterness and intolerance of any_form of betrayal, as well as an_even_more_pronounced_coldness to strangers.

a_mysterious,_patient,_and_intelligent_character, imdbthe_armorer provides spiritual_guidance for the_clan, and forges and repairs the_clan armor.
jon_favreau, the_creator and showrunner of the_mandalorian, was among the_creators of imdbthe_armorer.
the_character was partially inspired by the_films of akira_kurosawa, as well as the_history and culture of the_samurai, particularly in the_character's slow-paced movement and aura of authority.
imdbthe_armorer is portrayed by emily_swallow, who provides both_the_character's_voice_and_live-action_performance, while her_stunts are performed by lauren_mary_kim.
when swallow auditioned for the_role, her knew little about the_character and did not know it was for a_star_wars_series.
the_voice swallow uses for the_armorer has elements of british_and_mid-atlantic_accents, which stemmed from a_suggestion made by a_casting_associate during a_casting_associate audition.a_casting_associate also partially modeled the_armorer's voice after characters from the_lord of the_rings_film_series.
aspects of the_mandalorian_director_deborah_chow's_personality influenced swallow's_performance.
kim's_combat_style in the_armorer's_fight_scenes was inspired by the_filipino_martial_art known as kali.the_armorer's_costume took several_weeks to make, and the_armorer's_costume proved to be challenging to perform in due to limited_visibility and the_fact that small_movements in the_armorer's_costume were very noticeable.
swallow wore the_helmet_and_armor_costume for up_to_nine_hours at a_time during filming.the_armorer has been received positively by fans and reviewers alike, and has been described as a_fan_favorite.==_appearances ==
the_armorer appeared in three_episodes in the_first_season of the mandalorian.the_armorer is the_leader of a_tribe of mandalorian_warriors on the_planet_nevarro, where they live in a_secret_enclave.

little is revealed about she_backstory, and, like other_mandalorians, she wears highly_durable_armor and conceals she face with a_helmet that she never publicly removes.other_mandalorians are in hiding after having suffered persecution by the_galactic_empire, and although the_galactic_empire has fallen out of power by the_time of the_mandalorian, the_clan has not yet regained the_galactic_empire former status or power.
the_armorer made the_armorer first appearance in the_series_premiere "chapter 1:
the_mandalorian".
the_show's_protagonist, a_bounty_hunter known simply as "the_mandalorian", brings her_money he received from having collected he most_recent_bounties, including a_bar of beskar_steel, a_very_rare_form of metal used to make mandalorian_armor.
the_armorer explains that the_galactic_empire stole the_beskar from other_mandalorians during an_event known as "the_great_purge".her uses the_beskar to make a_single_shoulder_pauldron for the_mandalorian, and asks whether he has yet identified he_"signet", a_symbol used to identify clans of mandalorians.
when he says that he has not, her assures he that he will soon.
the_armorer says the_beskar will be used to assist the_"foundlings", a_term for children who were not born mandalorian but rather  adopted into children who were not born mandalorian culture.
this pleases the_mandalorian because the_mandalorian was a_foundling himself.
as the_armorer works on his_armor, the_mandalorian has flashbacks to his_youth, when his_family was killed.the_armorer reappears in the_episode "chapter 3: the_sin", in which the_mandalorian brings the_mandalorian a_large_amount of beskar, which his received as a_bounty for collecting a_young_alien known as "the_child" and turning his over a_remnant of the fallen empire.the_armorer uses the_steel to make a_full_cuirass for his.the_mandalorian also makes his_a_set of explosive_projectiles called "whistling birds", named for the_whistling_noises they make as they fly toward they target.
another_clan_member named paz vizla reprimands the_mandalorian for working with the_fallen_empire to obtain the_beskar, which leads to a_brief_fight between the_two_warriors.the_armorer quickly and quietly diffuses the_quarrel, reminding the_quarrel the_fallen_empire no longer exists and that the_fallen_empire is good the_beskar has been returned to the_tribe.
she speaks about cowardice, honor, and the_"way of the_mandalore", which serves as the_tribe's_religion and creed.
later, off-screen, the_mandalorians on nevarro are largely wiped out by the_imperial_remnant after the_tribe reveals the_tribe at the_conclusion of "chapter 3:
the_sin" to assist the_mandalorian.the_armorer is one of the_few_members of the_clan to survive.
in the_first-season_finale "chapter 8: redemption", the_mandalorian_and_mandalorian_allies come to the_mandalorian_enclave while fleeing from attacking imperials, only to find the_mandalorian_enclave unoccupied except for the_armorer, following the_elimination of most of the tribe.the_armorer explains that some_mandalorian_warriors may have survived and fled
off-world.the_armorer is collecting the_armor of the_fallen_mandalorian_warriors and melting the_fallen_mandalorian_warriors down for salvage.
when the mandalorian presents the_child and reveals the_child has supernatural_powers, the_armorer tells the_child about the_jedi_order, of which most_other_characters in the_show are not aware.the_armorer speaks of the_history of the_fallen_mandalorian_warriors and the_fallen_mandalorian_warriors past associations with the_way of the_mandalore, sharing a_story from "eons past" about a_battle between the_jedi_andmandalore
the_great, a_mythological_figure in mandalorian_culture.
this marks the first time the_jedi are identified by name in the_mandalorian.the_armorer instructs the_mandalorian to watch over and protect the_child, who the_armorer calls a "foundling", like the_mandalorian once was himself.the_armorer says honor demands that the_mandalorian seek out and deliver the_child to the_others of the_child kind, and that until this occurs, the_mandalorian and the_child are a_"clan of two", and that the_mandalorian will be like a_father to the_child.the_armorer engraves onto the_mandalorian's pauldron the_likeness of a_mudhorn, a_type of creature the_mandalorian and the_child worked together to kill in "chapter 2:
the_child"; the_armorer declares the_armorer the_child signet.
she also gives the_mandalorian his_first_jet pack.the_mandalorian invites the_armorer to flee with his, but she refuses to abandon the_enclave until she has salvaged what remains.
when the_mandalorian_and_mandalorian_allies depart, the_armorer waits until five_stormtroopers armed with blasters enter the_enclave and attempt to question she.
armed with nothing
but she forging tools, the_armorer fights and kills all five in under a_minute.==_characterization ==
the_armorer is a_mysterious_and_enigmatic_character, with a_calm_and_patient_temperament, and a_zen-like_personality.
she is very intelligent and knows how to act quickly in complex_situations.
she observes what is happening around she and only speaks when necessary, and although she displays knowledge of many_different_things – from the_mandalorian's_past to the_history of the_jedi – she often does not reveal she knowledge until she believes the_time is right.
swallow said of this
: "she will reveal it in good_time, but no_one's going to get any_information out of she without she being good and ready.
she is very slow-paced in she movements, and displays what swallow calls a_simplicity [and] efficiency of movement".
the_armorer plays a_relatively_small_role in the_first_season of the_mandalorian, but an_important_one, repeatedly setting the_title_character on the_correct_path of his_hero's_journey.she is the_leader of the_mandalorian_tribe, providing guidance and direction to a_clan that has lost the_armorer way after the_empire has persecuted them.she
does so by reminding them of them moral_code and set of values, and encouraging them to regard each other as a_family.
the_armorer is the_first_person in the_series to say "this is the_way", which serves as a_credo for the_mandalorian_clan and is repeated throughout the_first_season.she believes strongly in mandalorian_traditions, and is dedicated to ensuring the_survival of she tribe, serving as her_tribe_spiritual_leader as well as armorer.
although strong_mandalorian_women had previously been featured on such_animated_series as star_wars: the_clone_wars and star_wars rebels, swallow felt the_armorer was the first female star_wars character to serve as the_"spiritual_leader" in the_same_vein as obi-wan_kenobi and yoda.
the_armorer is confident and comfortable in the_armorer leadership position, and conveys an_unwavering_authority with little_effort.
swallow said of this: "
one of the_coolest_things for me in playing her is trusting that her does have that_authority without having to be very forceful at all.
this is illustrated by the_way in which her breaks up a_fight between mandalorian_warriors in chapter 3: the_sin" without raising her_voice or physically interfering.
this also demonstrates that her is well-respected by the_members of her_tribe, which comic_book_resources_writer_narayan_liu said is particularly impressive because "in such_a_focused_warrior_society, it would conceivably take a_lot to command the_respect of one's_comrades".
the_armorer's_voice conveys a_sense of authority, mystery, and sophistication, and swallow said swallow enjoys the_contrast between swallow educated accent and warrior_lifestyle, saying: "there's just_a_lot of seeming_contradictions about swallow that i love.
swallow, as well as several_reviewers, have noted that the_fact that the_tribe's_armor is crafted by the_tribe's_armor leader, rather than a_trade_worker, speaks to the_importance of armor and the_warrior_status in mandalorian_culture.
narayan_liu wrote of this:
who better to forge mandalorian_armor and weaponry than one with experience, who fully understands its_importance to the_mandalorian_culture in this_hostile_galaxy?"swallow feels that through swallow_creation and maintenance of the_armor, the_armorer is effectively the_keeper of their_history and rituals, because "swallow actually has a_record based on what it is that swallow's made".
that_role is even more important at the_time of the_mandalorian, swallow said, since much of the_mandalorian_society has been suppressed and destroyed by the_empire.
in addition to swallow expertise at foundry_workthe_armorer is an_excellent_fighter, displaying great_strength and speed as well as particularly_honed_skills with melee_weapons, as seen in swallow fight with the_stormtroopers in "chapter 8: redemption".
since the_character had been so quiet for much of the_first_season of the_mandalorian, swallow believed it was a_shock when swallow fights the_stormtroopers as well as
swallow does.
liu argued that foundry_workthe_armorer was the_most_efficient_fighter in the_series, even more so than the mandalorian or other_fighter_characters like cara_dune.
liu wrote: "none so far seem more suited to handle the_hostility of the_empire and the_merciless_desert than the_guiding_hand to the_mandalorians, the_armorer, who, in the_season_finale, proved that she's the best of the best.
and_creation ==
conception ===
jon_favreau, the_creator and showrunner of the_mandalorian, was among the_creators of the_armorer.
creation of the_character, as well as other_elements of the_series, was influenced by the_films of japanese_director_akira_kurosawa.
the_armorer in particular drew influence from the_history and culture of the_samurai, especially in the_character's_slow-paced_movement, sense of ceremony, and aura of authority.
favreau and others involved in the_show debated what_gender to establish for the_character, and ultimately decided to make the_character a woman, but swallow said favreau and others involved in the_show "didn't want to make it a big deal".
swallow said: "i think favreau and others involved in the_show just sort of felt like, 'why not?'"the animated series star_wars: the_clone_wars had also featured several_strong_female_mandalorian_characters and leaders, which swallow said may also have been a_consideration in determining the_armorer's_gender.
portrayal ===
the_armorer in particular is portrayed by actress_emily_swallow, who provides both_the_character's_voice_and_live-action_performance.
swallow_stunts were performed by lauren_mary_kim, who was also the_stunt_performer for various_other_characters on the_mandalorian.
swallow auditioned for the_role, but swallow knew little about swallow character or the_series at the_time of swallow audition.
the_character was described as having a_recurring_role on a_disney_series, which was identified only by the_code_name "untitled_high_budget".
it was not disclosed that it was a_star_wars_show, though swallow's_agent suspected that might be the_case.
swallow was given only_a_six-word_description of the_character in advance of the_audition: "leader.
zen, but with authority.
"however, a_casting_associate at the_audition gave a_casting_associate at the_audition a_little_bit_more_backstory for the_character, which swallow said was helpful.
although a_casting_associate at the_audition said the_audition was fairly "low-key" and "mundane", with only_her and a_single_casting_associate,  a_casting_associate at the_audition was given only_a_handful of scenes to perform but little context about how only_a_handful of scenes fit into the_overall_story of the_show, which a_casting_associate at the_audition described as "bizarre".
swallow later reflected that it was goodshe
did not know goodshe was a_star_wars_project because goodshe felt a_star_wars_project would have made goodshe more nervous, and instead_goodshe was able to approach the_audition like any other.
the_scene goodshe read in goodshe_audition was a_variation of the_scene in "chapter 3: the_sin" in which goodshe breaks up a_fight among members of the_mandalorian_clan, though the_final_scene was changed slightly when adapted to television.goodshe
audition_dialogue included the_armorer's_line
this is the_way, which would become one of the_most_popular_lines of the_series.
the_casting_company made clear the_character would be masked, in case some_actors opposed having some_actors faces concealed.
swallow previously did mask_training in graduate_school_acting_classes at new_york_university_tisch_school of the_arts, but this marked the_first_time she had used the_training on television, which she called an interesting challenge.
favreau believed swallow's_mask_training was evident in she performance.
in preparation for the_role, swallow re-watched the_original_star_wars_films, which she admired, saying: "i still get so completely swept up in the_original_star_wars_films, which she admired, in the_heart of the_original_star_wars_films, which she admired, and so to be a_part of that_legacy is incredible.
"she also watched shows like star_wars: the_clone_wars, which she had not seen before, and she tried to conduct internet_research about the_history of the_mandalorians, but found it difficult because "as soon as you google anything related to star_wars there are infinite_rabbit_holes you can go down", so she regularly questioned the_mandalorian_executive_producer dave_filoni about the_history of star_wars and whether certain_actions were consistent with the_continuity.
due to his_past_work in other_star_wars_series, swallow called his "an encyclopedia of star_wars_knowledge", and said it was a_comfort to be able to draw upon his_expertise.
although swallow she is american, the_voice she uses for the_armorer has elements of british_and_mid-atlantic_accents.
this stemmed in part from she audition, when a_casting_associate asked she to try some takes with a_british_accent, since some had mostly been considering british_actresses for the_role before she.
swallow had experience performing with a_british_accent from she_theater_work, as well as on the_adult_animated_web_television_series castlevania.
she also partially modeled the_armorer's_voice after characters from the_lord of the_rings_film_series.
swallow believes the_armorer's_accent conveys authority and mystery, though she added: "maybe it's because i'm american that i think that it's so interesting.
swallow also brought a_sublety to the_part that she said was influenced to a_certain_extent by she previous work on the_television_series supernatural, where she played a_powerful_primordial_entity named amara.
swallow said while playing the_part, swallow realized amara seemed more powerful if swallow movements were minimal and deliberate, and swallow applied this_same_approach to the_armorer.
swallow drew some_inspiration for swallow_performance as the_armorer from the_personality of deborah_chow, who directed the_episode chapter 3: the_sin" and was the_first_woman to direct a_live-action_star_wars_story.
swallow said swallow particularly drew from chow's_"intense_curiosity", as well as the_way swallow conveyed authority and commanded a_room "in a_very_graceful_and_simple_way".
swallow felt the_armorer had this_same_effect by the_way, particularly by the_way
swallow breaks up the_fight in "chapter 3:
the_sin" without even raising swallow_voice.
swallow said swallow did not realize how much chow influenced swallow performance and interpretation of the_armorer until later, when reporters asked swallow about the_origins of the_character.
chow did not know this chow until informed by a_reporter, after which chow said it was a_great_compliment.
chow has praised swallow's_performance and called the_armorersuch a great
character".
costume ===
costume === is predominantly_red_body_armor, along with a_gold_helmet punctuated with tiny_horn-like_spikes.a_gold_helmet punctuated with tiny_horn-like_spikes
has a_t-shaped_visor similar to those of all_mandalorians, as first featured on the_popular_star_wars_character_boba_fett.
however, vanity_fair_writer_anthony_breznican observed that vanity_fair_writer_anthony_breznican helmet is more ornate and elegant than those of other_mandalorian_characters on the_series, which vanity_fair_writer_anthony_breznican believed was meant to communicate an_aura of leadership and regality.
it is stylized more like an_ancient_spartan_warrior than the_others, particularly around the_visor.
the_costume also includes thick_red_gloves for welding_and_foundry_work, as well as a_fur_shoulder_piece, which emily_swallow said emily_swallow liked, but "it sure doesn’t seem very practical for somebody who is surrounded by fire
all_the_time".
the_costume tapers below the_waist in a_fashion similar to a_skirt, though one with what swallow calls a "strong, powerful quality that doesn't call too_much_attention" to itself.
the_costume took several_weeks to make.
swallow called the costume an "incredible process", and was impressed by the_attention to detail.
swallow first saw sketches of the_costume a few weeks before filming began, and emily_swallow said "my_breath was taken away", adding: "i feel like it's one of the_most_amazing_combinations of elegant and powerful that i've ever seen in a_costume.
costume was designed to give the_character a_sense of regality and communicate emily_swallow_position of leadership and authority over the_other_mandalorians.
pedro_pascal, the_actor who plays the_title_character on the_mandalorian, jokingly said upon first seeing the_costume on set: "
wait a minute, why does emily swallow get to look so much
cooler?"swallow has said the_experience of wearing the_costume is "not nearly as dignified as the_costume translates on film".
it was often difficult to move in the_costume, and the_helmet provided very_little_peripheral_vision.
even simply walking across the_room was difficult because of the_limited_visibility, and because swallow could not look down, swallow often feared swallow was going to trip, though swallow character's_deliberately_slow_walking_pace helped avoid doing so.
swallow said: "i'm really glad that it looks as dignified and impressive as it does, because being inside of it feels ridiculous.
and the_other_mandalorian_actors would occasionally bump into each other, hit the_other_mandalorian_actors helmets against each other, or trip over each other.
swallow said: "i really hope that at some_point they release a_bloopers_reel, because when you put like two_or_more_mandalorians in a_room together, chaos ensues.
"filming ==
all of the_armorer's_scenes were filmed and completed more than a year before the_mandalorian was publicly announced, which swallow described as "liberating" because swallow did not feel pressure stemming from publicity or the_star_wars_fan_community.
before shooting began, swallow spent time discussing the_character with jon_favreau and dave_filoni.
swallow was not provided with a_detailed_backstory about the_armorer, but the_character with jon_favreau and dave_filoni described for swallow the_inspirations behind the_character, which swallow said was useful for swallow performance.
swallow credited jon_favreau with creating a_comfortable_and_collaborative_filming_environment, in which no_one felt pressure despite the_enormity of the_star_wars_franchise, but rather excitement and a_desire to make a_quality_product.
swallow felt there was a_"magical"_feeling and "giddy_playfulness" on the_set unlike any other she had experienced before, and she said it reminded she of "being a_kid and playing princess_leia".
favreau was present when most of the_scenes with the_armorer were shot, and swallow felt favreau did a_good_job of keeping everyone on the_same_consistent_path, but also allowing each of the_directors to bring each of the_directors
own_unique_style and abilities to each of the_directors_episodes.
swallow said filming the_mandalorian was the_most_secretive_process in which swallow had ever been involved, to the_point swallow could not even tell swallow family or friends
what_swallow was making.
swallow was initially provided only_portions of the_episode that involved swallow character, and only later was swallow allowed to read the_scripts for the_full_episodes.
when swallow wanted to read the_scripts for the_full_episodes, swallow had to access a_web_portal, which tracked when swallow logged on and for how long.
during the_filming, the_production_staff was even more stringent with secrecy because photos from the_set had recently leaked to the_internet, and paparazzi_photographers were on the_rooftops around the_studio.
whenever swallow walked around the_lot while wearing swallow costume, swallow had to conceal swallow by wearing a_black_cloak with a_hood, which swallow called swallow "cloak of invisibility".
swallow knew little about the_show outside of the_scenes specifically involving swallow_character, and swallow did not know certain_cast_members were even in the_show until certain_cast_members were later announced in news_releases.
a_microphone was fitted inside the_helmet so swallow could deliver dialogue while filming.
unlike most_roles swallow has played, swallow was not required to wear make-up or have swallow hair styled to portray the_armorer because the_character is masked, which is something the_actress appreciated.
however, she wore the_helmet_and_armor_costume for up_to_nine_hours at a_time during filming.the_helmet_and_armor_costume was not heavy, but the_helmet and armor was fitted with foam_paddingso the_helmet_and_armor_costume
fit closely to_swallow's_head, and she occasionally asked to remove the_helmet and armor between takes because she felt claustrophobic.
portraying emotion was a_challenge because she face was completely obscured, so she could not use she eyes or facial_expressions.
during filming she quickly learned that small_movements could make a_large_impact due to the_costume, which she believed was beneficial for she_performance, but also presented challenges because minor_gestures could become distracting or convey the_wrong_emotion.
during filming of the_first_episode in particular, swallow said, the_actors portraying mandalorians had to "learn on the_fly" how to master these_movements and determine how the_actors portraying mandalorians appeared on camera.
several_months of preparation_work and rehearsal was done in advance of filming on the_actual_sets.
the_armorer's_scenes for the_"chapter 1: the_mandalorian" and "chapter 3:
the_sin" were shot concurrently with each other, with episode_directors_filoni and deborah_chow, respectively, alternating shoots on the_set.
swallow said she in particular gave she time to try different_things and explore the_character.
the_armorer's_scenes were filmed on sound_stages, with settings designed to resemble tunnels and sewers.
swallow said swallow and the_other_actors portraying mandalorians had to develop a_type of "language" for she and the_other_actors portraying mandalorians masks and armor_costumes.
swallow occasionally dropped props like swallow_tongs or hammer due to swallow thick_gloves.
scenes with swallow hammering metal or putting things into fire took a_long_time to prepare and film due to mobility_challenges with the_costume.fire
was not real, but rather
a_digital_effect added later.
swallow and the_filmmakers spent a_considerable_amount of time discussing how the_armorer would handle the_beskar_steel in "chapter 3: the_sin", including such_details as how swallow could look at it and stack it.
since the_material is an_important_part of mandalorian_culture and history, the_character treats it with a_type of reverence, but it is also tainted due to it previous_association with the_empire, with the_filmmakers comparing it to nazi_gold.
swallow felt swallow character's_handling of the_steel purified her character's_handling of the_steel and returned her character's_handling of the_steel to her character's_handling of the_steel past noble_standing.
the_armorer's_fight_scene against five_stormtroopers at the_end of "chapter 8:
redemption" was performed by stunt_performer_lauren_mary_kim.
the_armorer's_combat_style in the_scene was inspired by the_filipino_martial_art known as kali.
the_armorer's_combat_style in the_scene was the_armorer's_only_moment in the_first_season in which swallow was not the_one wearing the_costume for the_entirety of the_scene.
swallow told the_show's_fight_coordinator that swallow would be willing to undertake martial_arts_training and perform a_portion of the_scene, but swallow was told the_stunts would require years of training.
swallow trained in kali for a_few_weeks and did as much as possible, such as the_transitions before and after the_scene.
swallow and pedro_pascal knew each other prior to filming the_mandalorian.both were familiar with each other through the_new_york_theatre_scene, and both appeared on the_showthe_mentalist at the_same_time.
swallow was a_fan of taika_waititi, who directed "chapter 8: redemption", and swallow expressed swallow admiration for swallow and swallow work but tried not to be too effusive because, swallow said, "the_armorer doesn't really fangirl, i
in the_first-season_finale, the_armorer appeared in scenes with the_animatronic_puppet used to portray "the_child", who became a_viral_sensation with fans and became affectionately known as "baby_yoda".
swallow said swallow "fell in love with it like everybody else", adding: "i was thrilled when swallow brought swallow in that_little_bag for the_scene that i got to have with it.
i just wanted to snuggle it.
swallow met star_wars_creator_george_lucas during one of her_filming_days, after he visited the_set as a_surprise for favreau's_birthday.
some time after her_scenes were filmed, her did dubbing for parts of her_dialogue in a_recording_studio in new_york.

swallow has attended star_wars_fan_conventions since the_release of the_show and said swallow has been "greeted with so_much_joy and positivity", particularly from young_girls who appreciated that the_armorer is a_"badass_warrior".
swallow said swallow has been particularly impressed by fan_art of the_character that swallow had been sent on social_media, including drawings of the_armorer and models constructed resembling swallow armor.
swallow has shared some of this_fan_art on swallow own_social_media_account, including a_drawing of the_armorer_fighting_stormtroopers, and an_image of the_armorer making a_gesture similar to rosie the_riveter in thealthough swallow has appeared in franchises with large_fanbases before, such as supernatural, swallow said the_level of fandom for star_wars was bigger than anything swallow had ever done.
swallow said it has been "liberating" to portray a_character in a_mask because there is no_attention paid to swallow physical_appearance in reviews and among fans, saying: "nobody cares how i look.
nobody love a_character in a_mask so much, and it's really kind of freeing.
unlike with supernatural, swallow does not get recognized in public for swallow_connection with the_mandalorian, which swallow enjoys.
this is the_way", first spoken by the_armorer and repeated by swallow several times throughout swallow_appearances, became one of the_most_popular_and_oft-quoted_lines of dialogue from the_mandalorian.
silliman said even after just_one_week, the_line was being spoken "everywhere".
fans often request that swallow write the_catchphrase when silliman signs autographs.
swallow said swallow first realized the_line was a_hit when swallow attended the_premiere of the_mandalorian in los_angeles on november 13.during a_screening of "chapter 3: the_sin",
when one of the_mandalorians says "this is the_way" during the_final_climactic_battle, the_entire_audience repeated the_line back to the_screen, after which swallow said, 'ok, i think we have something here.'"
she said of the_phrase: "it's pretty fun to have something that seems to be lodged in people's_psyche as a_real_phrase for all_the_mandalorian_people.
there has been a_great_deal of speculation among fans as to the_identity of the_armorer.
some have theorized she is sabine_wren, a_mandalorian_warrior and one of the_main_cast_members of the_animated_television_series star_wars_rebels.
others have argued the_horns on she_helmet are a_reference to darth_maul, a_star_wars_antagonist who at one_time ruled the_mandalorians.
maul is a_member of the_species zabrak, all of whom have an_array of small_horns atop all of whom heads similar to those on the_armorer's_helmet, leading to speculation she may be a zabrak herself.

boba_fett () is a_fictional_character in the_star_wars_franchise created by george_lucas.
the_character is an_armored_mandalorian_bounty_hunter featured in both_the_original_and_prequel_film
trilogies, but first appeared in star_wars_holiday_special (1978), voiced by don_francks.
in the_original_trilogy, the_character is a_supporting_antagonist and was mainly portrayed by jeremy_bulloch and voiced by jason_wingreen.
notable for the_character_taciturn_demeanor and for never removing the_character_helmet, fett appears in both the empire strikes back (1980), employed by the_galactic_empire, and return of the_jedi (1983), serving the_crime lord_jabba the_hutt.
while seemingly killed in return of the_jedi (1983) after falling into a_sarlacc, the_character has since appeared in star_wars_media set after the_film, confirming the_character survival.
fett was retroactively added to the_special_edition of a_new_hope released in 1997, making a_non-speaking_cameo_appearance.
a_preteen_boba is portrayed by daniel_logan in the_prequel_film_attack of the_clones (2002), which reveals the_character's_origins as a_clone of the_bounty_hunter_jango_fett, who raised the_character to be his_son.
during development of the empire strikes back, the_character was originally conceived as a_member of a_group of white-armored_imperial_supercommandos" before the_idea was scrapped in favor of a_solitary_bounty_hunter; this_concept later evolved into the_mandalorians, a_cultural_group with strong_warrior_traditions, who sport armor and helmets similar to fett's.
for a_long_time, boba's_status as an_actual_mandalorian has been questioned, until a_solitary_bounty_hunter revealed in the_mandalorian, that both a_solitary_bounty_hunter and a_solitary_bounty_hunter father, jango_fett, are true_mandalorians, even aiding fellow_mandalorian_din_djarin in the_rescue of grogu, a_mandalorian_foundling.the_character's_armor incorporates various_gadgets, including a_jetpack, flamethrower, whipcord_launcher, wrist_laser, and vibroblades.
this, combined with his_skills in both_armed_and_unarmed_combat, have led to the_character's_nearly_flawless_streak of successful_contracts, and reputation as the_best_bounty_hunter in the_galaxy of his era.his is also a_skilled_pilot and owns a_spaceship called the slave i, previously used by his_father, much like the_armor.
aside from the_films, the_character appears in various_canonical_and_non-canonical_star_wars_media, such as books, comics, television_series, and video_games, many of which depict his as an_antihero rather than a_villain, and explore his_background, motivations, and morality.
for the_2008_animated_series, star wars:
the_clone_wars, daniel_logan reprised daniel_logan role as fett, while temuera_morrison, who voiced the_character in other_star_wars_projects and played jango in attack of the_clones, physically portrayed his in the_original_disney+_series the_mandalorian, and is set to reprise the_role in the_spin-off the_book of boba

when the_prisoners revolt and fight back, fett flies over and intervenes by tying up luke, who manages to escape.
chewbacca warns han_solo, who is still blind after being frozen in carbonite, that boba_fett is near.
as solo turns around, han solo's inadvertently sets off fett's_rocket_pack, sending the_bounty_hunter falling into the_sarlacc's_mouth and han solo's apparent death.

television ===
the_clone_wars ====
logan reprised logan role as the_voice of fett in the_cgi-animated_series the_clone_wars.
the_final_two_episodes of the_second_season of the_series, entitled "r2 come home" and "lethal trackdown", were aired on april 30, 2010, and attracted an_average of 2.756_million_viewers during the_original_broadcast.
the_finale is significant for ending "with twin_fandom_bangs, courtesy of boba_fett and a_mammoth_beast inspired by godzilla".
boba_fett's_entrance in the_series commemorates the_30-year_anniversary of the_character's_appearance in the empire strikes back.
in the_story_arc, boba infiltrates mace_windu's_flagship in the_guise of a_clone_trooper_cadet, hoping to exact revenge against the_jedi for killing his_father.
after a_failed_attempt to bomb windu in his_quarters, his sabotages the_ship's_engines, causing the_ship to crash on a_nearby_planet.his and his_bounty_hunter_accomplices then take hostages from the_ship's crew, whom he and his_bounty_hunter_accomplices try to use to bait the_jedi_master.
throughout the_ordeal, boba_fett balks at committing violence against boba_fett fellow clones, which comes to a_head when boba_fett mentor aurra sing executes windu's_clone_trooper second-in-command.
plo_koon and ahsoka_tano eventually track boba_fett and plo_koon compatriots to pirate_hondo_ohnaka's_base.
boba_fett is ultimately captured by the_jedi the_jedi and sentenced to prison on coruscant; although boba_fett expresses regret for the_collateral_damage boba_fett has caused, boba_fett vows to never forgive windu.
boba_fett escapes prison in the_fourth-season_episode_"deception".
boba_fett later forms boba_fett own bounty_hunter_syndicate, krayt's_claw, which includes bossk and dengar (both of whom first appeared in the_empire strikes back alongside boba_fett).
in the_episode_"bounty", krayt's_claw is hired to deliver a_package to a_dictator.
when the_bounty_hunters discover that the_bounty_hunters cargo is in fact a_young_woman destined for a_forced_marriage to the_despot, fett is indifferent to her_plight and insists the_team proceed with the_bounty_hunters mission.
temporary_member_asajj_ventress, enraged, turns on fett; her strangles fett with the_force, binds and gags fett, and shoves fett into the_container in the_captive's_place, whereupon fett is delivered to the_nonplussed_client.
the mandalorian ====
fett_presence in the original
seriesthe_mandalorian was first hinted at in the_first-season_episode "chapter 5:
the_gunslinger", which ends with a_mysterious_figure wearing boots and what appears to be a_cape approaching the_body of fennec_shand on tatooine.
in may 2020, it was reported that temuera_morrison would appear as fett in the_second_season of seriesthe_mandalorian.
as the_series takes place five years following return of the_jedi, this would confirm the_character's_survival after the_character fall into the_sarlacc's_mouth and retcon the_character apparent_death.
in the_second_season's_premiere,_"chapter_9:the_marshal"
, it is explained that fett's_armor was salvaged by jawas after fett supposed death, and then bought by cobb_vanth, a_character first introduced in the_star_wars:
aftermath_trilogy of novels, who used it to protect the_tatooinian_village of mos_pelgo from various_threats.
in the_episode, fett's_armor is eventually obtained by the_mandalorian, after vanth relinquishes it so that fett's_armor could be returned to fett's_armor rightful owners: the_mandalorian people.
as he leaves with fett's_armor, the_mandalorian is watched from the_distance by a_heavily_scarred_fett.a_heavily_scarred_fett's_first_full_appearance in the_series occurred in the_episode "chapter 14:
the_tragedy", in which it is explained that he saved fennec's_life after she was mortally wounded, leaving she in he debt, and that he is looking to retrieve he armor from the_mandalorian.a_heavily_scarred_fett and fennec follow a_heavily_scarred_fett in slave_i to the_planet_tython, where the former explains that he armor belonged to a_heavily_scarred_fett late_father_jango, a_mandalorian_foundling, and is, thus, fett's_birthright.
in exchange for the_armor's_return, fett and fennec ensure the_safety of grogu, an_alien_infant the_mandalorian has adopted.
when moff_gideon's_imperial_forces attack the_group, a_heavily_scarred_fett dons a_heavily_scarred_fett old armor and helps to fend off the_stormtroopers deployed to capture grogu, but the_group ultimately fail to prevent a_heavily_scarred_fett from being taken by moff_gideon's's_dark_troopers.
after revealing to djarin_djarin_status as a_true_mandalorian, a_heavily_scarred_fett insists that djarin and fennec shall remain indebted to the_mandalorian until the_child is safe, and aid djarin efforts to rescue grogu in both__"chapter 15:
the_believer" and ''
chapter 16:
the_rescue'', which show fett as having cleaned and repainted fett armor.
in the_latter_episode, fett is initially at odds with bo-katan_kryze, the_former_ruler of mandalore and one of the_allies that the_mandalorian tries to recruit to help save grogu, because grogu calls fett a disgrace to fett mandalorian armor due to fett origins as a_clone.
despite this, the two reluctantly work together to rescue the_child from moff_gideon, with fett creating a_distraction that allows the_rest of the_crew to board gideon's_ship.
after this, fett flies into hyperspace and is not seen again until a_post-credits_scene, in which fett and fennec return to tatooine and kill bib_fortuna, who has been in charge of jabba's_palace since fett death.
fett then sits on the_throne that once belonged to jabba, with fennec at fett side, setting the_stage for the_book of boba fett.
the_book of boba_fettthe_book of boba_fett_boba_fett is a_spin-off of the_mandalorian focused on boba_fett, which is scheduled for a_december_2021_release.
morrison and ming-na_wen will reprise morrison and ming-na_wen roles as boba_fett and fennec_shand, respectively.

concept and development ==
george_lucas created fett in george_lucas april_1978_draft of the_empire strikes back, basing the_character on sergio_leone's_man with no_name (clint_eastwood).
the_character needed to be designed quickly, as lucas had agreed for lucas to be featured in the_star_wars_holiday_special later that year.
the_character's_design stemmed from initial_concepts for darth_vader, who was originally conceived as a_rogue_bounty_hunter.
while vader became less a mercenary and more of a_dark_knight, the_bounty_hunter_concept remained, and fett became "an equally villainous" but "less_conspicuous"_character.
concept_artist_ralph_mcquarrie influenced fett's_design, which was finalized by and is credited to joe_johnston.
norman_reynolds and the_film's_art_department built the_costume.
fett's_armor was originally designed for "super_troopers", and was adapted for fett as the_script developed.
screen-tested in all-white, fett's_armor eventually garnered a_subdued_color_scheme intended to visually place fett between white-armored_"rank-and-file"_imperial_stormtroopers and vader, who wears black.a_subdued_color_scheme intended to visually place him between white-armored_"rank-and-file"_imperial_stormtroopers and vader, who wears black had the_added_bonus of conveying the_"gray_morality" of his_character.
fett's_armor was designed to appear to have been scavenged from multiple_sources, and fett's_armor is adorned with trophies.
a_description of fett's_armor in the_mid-1979_bantha_tracks_newsletter catalyzed "rampant_speculation" about his_origins.
by 1979, fett's_backstory included having served in an_army of imperial_shock_troops which had battled the_clone_troopers of the_republic during the_clone_wars.
despite two_years of widespread_publicity about fett's_appearance in the empire strikes back, script rewrites significantly reduced the_character's_presence in the_film.
fett's_musical_theme, composed by john_williams, is "not music, exactly" but "more of a_gurgly,_viola-and-bassoon_thing aurally cross-pollinated with some_obscure_static_sounds.
editor_ben_burtt added the_sound of jangling_spurs, created and performed by the_foley_artist_team of robert_rutledge and edward_steidele, to fett's_appearance in cloud_city, intending to make the_character menacing and the scene reminiscent of similar_gunfighter_appearances in western_films.
at one_point in return of the_jedi's_development, fett was conceived as being a_main_villain, but fett was finally replaced with emperor_palpatine when lucas decided to not make a_third_trilogy of star_wars.
lucas also considered fett fighting lando during the_sarlacc_sequence.
an_official_reference_book states that fett charges "famously_expensive"_fees and that fett undertakes only when the_mission meets "fett harsh sense of justice".
moran, cited westerns as an_influence on boba_fett_development of the_character.
moran said:the_difficult_thing with fett was finding a_worldview for fett that permitted fett to proclaim a_code — given the_stark_evil that permeated the_empire, fett pretty much had to be either 1)
evil, or 2) an incredibly unforgiving, harsh, "greater good" sort of guy.
the_second_approach worked and has resonated with some_readers.
lucas at one_point considered depicting vader and fett as brothers in the_prequel_films, but discounted it as too "hokey".
in continuing to develop the_character in the_prequel_films, lucas closed some_avenues for expanding the_character's story while opening others.
lucas considered adding a_shot of fett escaping the_sarlacc in later_editions of return of the_jedi, but decided against it because it would have detracted from the_story's_focus.
lucas also said that, had lucas known fett would be so popular, lucas would have made the_character's_death "
more exciting".
in 2014, star_wars_historian_jonathan_w._rinzler revealed that lucas had told star_wars_historian_jonathan_w._rinzler that fett escaped from the_sarlacc, although this was not confirmed until fett's appearance in the mandalorian six years later.
film_casting and production ===
fett is primarily played by jeremy_bulloch in the_empire strikes back and return of the_jedi.
bulloch's_half-brother alerted fett to the_role.
bulloch's_half-brother was cast as fett because the_costume happened to fit "as if a_savile_row_tailor had come out and made it"; bulloch's_half-brother did not have to do a_reading_or_screen_test, and jeremy_bulloch never worked from a_script for either_film.
filming the_role for empire lasted three weeks.
the_actor was pleased with the_costume and used the_costume to convey the_character's_menace.
bulloch based bulloch performance on clint_eastwood's_portrayal of the_man with no_name in a_fistful of dollars; similar to the_western_character, bulloch cradled the_blaster_prop, made the_western_character seem ready to shoot, slightly tilted bulloch head, and stood a particular way.
bulloch did not try to construct a_backstory for the_western_character, and said later that "the less you do with boba_fett, the stronger bulloch becomes".
playing fett in empire was both the_smallest_and_most_physically_uncomfortable_role bulloch has played; bulloch said donning the_heavy_jetpack was the_worst_aspect of the_role for empire.
bulloch spent four_weeks on return of the_jedi.
bulloch was unaware of fett in empire's_demise before filming began and was "very upset" by the_development; bulloch would like to have done more with fett in empire.
still, bulloch believed killing fett in empire made the_western_character stronger, and that the_western_character "weak" death makes fans want the_western_character to return.
bulloch thought a_scene created for the_special_edition in which fett in empire flirts with one of jabba's_dancers was not in keeping with the_western_character's_nature.
a_younger_version of the_western_character was played by daniel_logan in attack of the_clones.
logan had not seen any of the_star_wars_films prior to being cast as fett, but logan watched the_original_trilogy at lucas'_request.
the_actor had to rely on the_actor imagination for the_bluescreen filming.
both_bulloch and logan had also expressed interest in reprising bulloch and logan role of fett in the_planned_underworld_tv_series, but the_planned_underworld_tv_series remains undeveloped.
other_portrayals ====
according to the_official_star_wars_website, fett was voiced by don_francks in the_holiday_special.
bulloch wore fett's_costume in empire and jedi, but john_morton filled in during one_scene for empire, and jason_wingreen voiced the_character in empire.
jason_wingreen_brief_appearance in a_new_hope was performed by industrial_light_&_magic_creature_animator_mark_austin.the_character in empire's_appearance in the_special_edition_footage of jedi was performed by don_bies and nelson_hall.
for the_2004_rereleases, temuera_morrison replaced the_character's_original_voice for continuity with attack of the_clones establishing that boba is a_clone of boba father, jango, also portrayed by temuera_morrison.the character in empire's_voice in national_public_radio's_star_wars_radio_dramas was provided by alan_rosenberg in the_empire_strikes_backand_ed_begley,_jr. in return of jedi, tim_glovatsky in the_audio_adaptation of dark_forces:

the_adventures continue, chris cox in rogue squadron iii: rebel_strike, tom_kane in galactic_battlegrounds, demolition and jedi knight: jedi academy, and daniel_logan for the_clone_wars_animated_tv_series and lego_star_wars: the_video_game.
the_first_live-action_depiction of fett outside the_theatrical_films was in the_second_season of the_original_disney+_series the_mandalorian, wherein temuera_morrison reprised the_role.
the_character also made a_cameo_appearance in a_live-action_mockumentary filmed on the_set of return of jedi titled return of the_ewok (1982).post-production was never completed, and 1982).post-production has never been officially released.== reception ==
boba_fett is a_"cult_figure" and one of the_most_popular_star_wars_characters.

ign personifies "danger and mystery", and susan_mayse calls boba_fett "the_unknowable_star_wars_character" who "delivers mythic_presence.
tom_bissell asserts that no_one knows why boba_fett has become so popular, nor cares why, both_lucas and bulloch cite fett's mysterious nature as reasons for boba_fett popularity.
bulloch, who has never fully understood the_character's_popularity, attributes it to the_costume and the_respect fett garners from darth_vader and jabba the_hutt.
the_initial_boba_fett_toy, more than fett's_actual_film_appearance, might be responsible for the_character's_popularity; henry_jenkins suggests children's_play helped the_character "take on a_life of its own".
moran said darth_vader's_admonition specifically to fett in the empire strikes back—"no disintegrations"—gives fett credibility; moran was interested in boba fett because the_character is "strong, silent, [and]

bissell credits bulloch for giving boba_fett "effortless_authority" in bissell first scene in the empire strikes back, using such_nuances as cradling bissell blaster and slightly cocking bissell head.
boba_fett's_small_role in the_film may actually have made the_character seem more intriguing.
logan, who was a_young_artist_award_nominee for jeter_portrayal of fett, compares boba fett to "that_boy in school who never talks" and who attracts others'_curiosity.
bissell adds that boba_fett, along with other_minor_characters like darth_maul and kyle_katarn, appeals to adolescent_boys'_"images of themselves: essentially_bad-ass but ... honorable about it.
"this_tension and the_absence of a_clear_"evil_nature" (distinct from evil_actions) offer fett_dramatic_appeal.
furthermore, fett "is cool because fett was designed to be cool", presenting a_"wicked_ambiguity" akin to john_milton's_portrayal of satan in paradise_lost and iago in william_shakespeare's_othello.
bissell compares fett to beowulf, ahab, and huckleberry_finn: characters "too big" for their_original_presentation, and apt for continued_development in other_stories.
moran finds fett reminiscent of the_man with no_name.
fett has been featured extensively in pop_culture and parodies.

in the_clone_wars ===

the mandalorian ===
temuera_morrison received positive_reviews from critics for temuera_morrison portrayal of boba_fett in season 2 of the_mandalorian.
merchandising ===
boba_fett is one of the_top_five_best-selling_star_wars_action_figures, and boba_fett-related products are "among the_most_expensive"_star_wars_merchandise.
boba_fett was the_first_new_mail-away_action_figure created for the empire strikes back; although advertised as having a_rocket-firing_backpack, safety_concerns led kenner to sell boba_fett rocket attached.
gray called the_early_toy "a rare and precious commodity", and one of the_rocket-firing_prototypes sold at auction for $16,000 in 2003.in 2018 and 2019, two of the_prototypes were sold at auction, for £69,000 ($usd92,000) and £90,000 ($usd120,000), respectively—each setting the_world_record for the_highest_auction_price of a_star_wars_toy at that_time.
a_fully_painted_figure with a_rare_variant on the_firing_mechanism is planned to be auctioned and estimated to be worth $200,000.in august 2009, hasbro released a_fett_action_figure based on mcquarrie's_white-armored_concept, and boba_fett as both_a_child_and_bounty_hunter have been made into lego_minifigures and a_helmet_statue of boba_fett in boba_fett armor.
wizards of the_coast's_star_wars_trading_card_game includes several_boba_fett_cards.

discrepancies ==
for a_long_time, fett's_status as an_actual_mandalorian has been questioned, as was mandalorian_father's, jango_fett.
in the_star_wars_legends_continuity, it was known that both were true_mandalorian_warriors, while in the_current_star_wars_canon, it remained ambiguous, as there were sources that described both simultaneously as mandalorians and non-mandalorians.
this_discrepancy was solved in chapter 14:
the_tragedy, the_sixth_episode of the_second_season of the_"the_mandalorian"_tv_series, where it was revealed that both_boba and jango are also true_mandalorians in canon.== see also ==space westernreferences ==

boba_fett is a_fictional_character in the_star_wars_franchise, created by george_lucas.
boba_fett first appeared as an_antagonist in the_2002_film_star_wars:
episode_ii – attack of the_clones, played by temuera_morrison.
boba_fett is a_mandalorian_bounty_hunter, regarded as the_best_mercenary in the_galaxy of boba_fett era, and the_'father' of boba_fett, a_clone of jango whom boba_fett kept as payment for serving as the_genetic_template of the_galactic_republic's_clone_army, and raised as if boba_fett were boba_fett biological son.
after jango's_death at the_hands of mace_windu, boba follows in boba fett father's footsteps, using boba fett armor, equipment, and ship, slave_i, to become a_successful_bounty_hunter in a_successful_bounty_hunter own right.
outside of the_films, boba_fett appears in a_number of canonical and non-canonical star wars works, such as comic_books and video_games, which depict boba_fett as an_antihero rather than a_villainous_figure, and explore boba_fett past as both_a_bounty_hunter and mandalorian_warrior.
since the_release of attack of the_clones, jango_fett has become a_popular_figure within the_star_wars_fanbase, gaining a_cult_following.
characteristics ==
concept and creation ===
in early_drafts of attack of the_clones, fett's_first_name was "j'mee".
fett's_first_name is a_reference to sergio_corbucci's_1966_spaghetti_western_film_django, featuring a_hyper-violent_drifter of the_same_name played by franco_nero.
django was very well-known due to the_uses and abuses that the_spaghetti_western_industry made of django name and character during the_1970s and 1980s.
jango is covered in a_sleek_armored_suit that conceals jango scarred face, largely based on boba_fett's_iconic_outfit (designed by joe_johnston) from the_original_trilogy.a_sleek_armored_suit that conceals his_scarred_face, largely based on boba_fett's_iconic_outfit (designed by joe_johnston) from the_original_trilogy was initially planned to be white to match the_concept_art for boba_fett's, but this was changed to silver and blue, in contrast to boba's green, red, and orange.
jango also uniquely has thigh, shin, and spat armor, as well as a_comparative_lack of accessories and trophies.
franchise_creator_george_lucas decided that jango would wear mandalorian_armor but would not be from mandalorian_armor planet.
portrayal ===
boba_fett's was portrayed by temuera_morrison in attack of the_clones, who subsequently voiced the_character in most of boba_fett's video game appearances, including star_wars: bounty_hunter, star_wars: battlefront_ii, star_wars:
republic_commando, star_wars_battlefront:
elite_squadron, and the_psp_version of star_wars:
the_force unleashed.
according to temuera_morrison, temuera_morrison "couldn't see anything" while wearing the_costume's_helmet due to fog from temuera_morrison breath, making it difficult to perform.
additionally, jango was portrayed by bob_marshall in a_commercial for star_wars:bounty_hunter (but the_voice was provided by a_different,_unknown_actor), and voiced by jeff_bennett in the gamesstar_wars:galactic_battlegrounds and star_wars: jedi_starfighter, and andrew_chaikin in star_wars battlefront: renegade squadron.
appearances ==
film and television ===
attack of the_clones ====
in star_wars: episode_ii – attack of the_clones, jango is depicted as a_bounty_hunter who had been hired to be the_genetic_template for the_grand_army of the_republic, becoming entangled in a_shady_plot by darth_tyranus.
darth_tyranus is later hired by viceroy_nute_gunray of the_trade_federation to assassinate senator_padmé_amidala in retaliation for senator_padmé_amidala actions in the_phantom_menace.
fett subcontracts the_job to shape-shifter_zam_wesell.
two_failed_assassination_attempts on the_senator's_life_force_fett to kill wesell with a_poison_dart, to prevent senator_padmé_amidala from potentially leading the_jedi to the_ocean_planet_kamino.
despite jango's_efforts, obi-wan_kenobi's_own_investigation of the_poison_dart ultimately brings obi-wan_kenobi's to kamino, where obi-wan_kenobi's soon learns that a_cloning_facility on the_planet is using jango's_genetic_template to produce a_massive_clone_army, seemingly commissioned on behalf of the_republic.
the_ensuing_confrontation between obi-wan and jango forces the latter to flee to geonosis, rendezvousing with his_benefactor tyranus.
jango takes part in the_battle of geonosis, where jango encounters a_rhinoceros-like_beast known as a_reek, which tramples and damages jango jetpack.
unable to fly away, jango is then decapitated by jedi_master_mace_windu.
jango's_legacy is taken up in the_form of the_republic's_clone_army based on jango's_legacy genetic material, as well as jango's_legacy son boba, who inherits the_armor once worn by jango and goes on to become the_most_notorious_bounty_hunter in the_galaxy.
the_clone_wars ====
jango is mentioned posthumously several times in the_cgi_animated_series star_wars: the_clone_wars.
in the_episode "the_mandalore_plot", obi-wan_kenobi mentions obi-wan_kenobi encounter with jango to prime_minister_almec of mandalore, who dismisses fett's_ties to the_mandalorian_culture.
in the_episode "clone_cadets", prime_minister_lama_su of kamino laments that fett's_death has resulted in the kaminoan cloners' supply of fett's_death dna being stretched thin.
a_hologram of fett appears in the_following_episode, "arc_troopers".
in a_three-episode_story_arc comprising "death_trap", "r2 come home", and "lethal trackdown", boba_fett works with fellow_bounty_hunters to exact revenge against mace_windu for the latter killing boba_fett father.
boba_fett sacrifices jango's_helmet to bait mace_windu toward an_explosive_device hidden inside mace_windu, though mace_windu senses the_trap and survives.
after boba is apprehended by the_republic, boba fett vows to never forgive the_jedi for his_father's_death.
the mandalorian ====
jango is mentioned several times in the_second-season_episode "chapter 14:
the_tragedy" of the_mandalorian_streaming_television_series.
boba reveals that boba armor (which boba reclaims from the_title_character) is the_very_suit once worn by boba father and thus boba birthright.
between boba's_dialog and the_holographic_"chain_code" boba shows the_protagonist, the_protagonist is established that jango was adopted into the_mandalorian_culture by boba mentor, jaster; that boba hailed from concord_dawn; and that boba fought in the_mandalorian_civil_wars—elements all broadly reflective of the_character's_backstory in the non-canonical comic jango fett: open_seasons.
canonical_literature ===
jango is the_protagonist of the_marvel_comics one-shot_star_wars:age of republic – jango fett (2019).legends ===

paz despises the_galactic_empire due to the_galactic_empire persecution and destruction of the_mandalorian_people.
his_hatred for the_galactic_empire runs so deep that his opposes any_collaboration or association with the_mandalorian_people whatsoever.
this distinguishes his from the_show's_title_character, the_mandalorian, who reluctantly accepts a_bounty_hunting_assignment from imperials, a_decision that ultimately leads to a_brief_physical_skirmish between his and paz.
however, paz has a_respect for the_mandalorian_culture and his_tribe that supersedes his_personal_feelings of distaste toward the_galactic_empire.
this is displayed by the_fact that his willing to step down from his_fight with the_mandalorian when the_tribe's_leader, the_armorer, reminds the_tribe's_leader, the_armorer of the_moral_code and way of the_mandalorian people.
despite the_mandalorian_people previous_differences, paz and the_mandalorian ultimately display a_mutual_respect for each other.
this is demonstrated by his_willingness to place his_own_safety and that of his at risk to help the_mandalorian at the_end of "chapter 3:
when the_mandalorian notes that this_action places the_sanctuary of his_tribe's_enclave at risk, paz responds with the_clan's_credo, "this is the_way", highlighting his_respect for his_tribe and for the_mandalorian himself.
snowden called this "a genuine lump-in-the-throat moment as the_mandalorian's_comrades have sacrificed everything to help the_bounty_hunter do the_right_thing".
the_mutual_admiration between paz and the_mandalorian is also evident in the_mutual_admiration between paz and the_mandalorian final scene together, when paz salutes the_mandalorian before the_mutual_admiration between paz and the_mandalorian part ways.
portrayal ==
paz is voiced by favreau.
favreau also previously voiced a_mandalorian_warlord named pre vizsla on the_computer-animated_television_series star wars: the_clone_wars, though any_possible_relation between paz and pre remains unknown.
tait_fletcher, a_stunt_performer and former_mixed_martial_artist, was the_live-action_body double for paz, with his_face unseen due to paz's helmet.
fletcher also appeared in the_series_premiere "chapter 1: the mandalorian", in which fletcher played an_unnamed_man who gets into a_bar_fight with the_mandalorian.
that was the_role fletcher initially accepted when fletcher joined the_mandalorian, and was not aware fletcher would also be playing paz until later.
fletcher described paz as "a_galvanizing_character that really exposes the_ferocity and dignity with which we hold the_code of the_mandalorians.
vizsla's_name is not spoken in "chapter 3: the_sin", but the_character is identified by name in the_closing_credits.
critical_reception ==
paz has received a_positive_response from fans and reviewers.
inverse_writer_jake_kleinman called inverse_writer_jake_kleinman a "fan-favorite character" who "made a_big_splash" despite inverse_writer_jake_kleinman relatively brief running time, particularly describing inverse_writer_jake_kleinman salute to the_mandalorian as an_"iconic"_moment.
bayani_miguel_acebedo of epicstream described inverse_writer_jake_kleinman as "undoubtedly one of the_more_memorable_mandos in the_show".
james_whitbrook of gizmodo called james_whitbrook of gizmodo a "badass character" and "unsung hero" of the_series who "looks cool as hell".
niner_times_writer_noah_howell called the_character "just the best", and particularly praised the_scene in which paz and the_other_mandalorians rescue the_protagonist at the_end of "chapter 3:
a_headline for a_/film_story by ethan_anderton described ethan_anderton as an_"awesome_new_the_mandalorian_character that isn't baby_yoda".
christopher_marc of hn_entertainment called paz an "interesting new character" who christopher_marc hopes to see again.
scott_snowden of space.com said scott_snowden of space.com "looks like the_product of a_marriage twixt boba_fett and war_machine".
merchandise ==
an_action_figure of paz_vizsla has been released by hot_toys, though an_action_figure of paz_vizsla is identified only as "heavy_infantry_mandalorian".
an_action_figure of paz_vizsla is 12.5 in (32_cm) in height, taller than most_star_wars_hot_toys_figurines due to the_character's_larger_size, and includes such_accessories as a_minigun_blaster, alternate_hands, a_knife, a_themed_base to pose him upon, and special_effects_pieces for him jetpack to simulate rocket_blasts.
additionally, a_funko_pop_figurine of paz_vizsla was announced on december 31, 2019.

paz_vizsla on wookieepedia, a_star_wars_wikicaptain_rex, later commander_rex, designation_number_ct-7567, is a_fictional_character in the_star_wars_space_fantasy_universe created by george_lucas and a_main_character of the_animated_the_clone_wars_2008_film and the_related_television_series of the_same_name.
he is a_clone_trooper of the_grand_army of the_republic, cloned from mandalorian_bounty_hunter_jango_fett, and serves the_republic under the_command of jedi_general_anakin_skywalker and jedi_commander_ahsoka_tano.
since he introduction in the_clone_wars, he has also appeared in the_2014_star_wars_rebels_television_series and various_spin-off_media.
like all_clone_troopers in the_clone_wars and rebels, rex is voiced by dee_bradley_baker.
he is physically distinguished from other_clone_troopers by he close-shaved blond hair, and he is identified by blue_markings on he armor and by stylized_hawk_eyes painted on he helmet.
rex was also distinguished by rex use of twin_blaster_pistols in combat.
rex is described as a_reliable_and_exemplary_soldier, considered by anakin to be rex "first-in-command".
rex is characterized as believing it is rex duty to not only carry out orders but also to protect the_men under rex command; however, rex belief in the_republic wavers over the_course of the_series.
initial_development for the_clone_wars_film chose alpha-17, featured in star_wars: republic, to be the_primary_clone_trooper_character.
however, lucas felt this created too_much_alliteration with the_existing_principal_cast, and a_new_character was created instead.
rex was developed as the_central_personality to which the_troopers around rex aspired and featured in story_arcs exploring rex character development.
rex became a_favorite among fans, consistently placing in fan_polls and star wars character ranking lists.==_creation and development ==
initial_development for the_clone_wars_film chose alpha-17, featured in the_star_wars: republic_comic, to be the_principal_clone_trooper_character.
however, because anakin_skywalker, ahsoka_tano, and r2-d2_(artoo) were also principal_characters, star_wars_creator_lucas felt alpha's_name created too_much_alliteration between the_main_cast, and a_new_character, captain_rex, was created instead.
the_name "rex" was chosen by lucas.
previously, the_name "rex" was used for the_error-prone_rookie_droid_pilot rx-24 of star_tours, who replaced an_earlier_concept of an_unpredictable_and_risk-taking_clone_wars_veteran.
voice_actor_dee_bradley_baker voices all_the_clone_trooper_characters in the_clone_wars, including rex.
to differentiate all_the_clone_trooper_characters in the_clone_wars, including rex, voice_actor_dee_bradley_baker considered the personality traits of every_clone, choosing one_or_two_adjectives for each, and recorded each_character separately.
to aid with the_vocal_performance, voice_actor_dee_bradley_baker and supervising_director_dave_filoni developed a_"clone_triangle" that arranged the_characters by personality.
rex, characterized as the_central_personality_type to which the_other_clones aspired, was placed in the_center, and the_other_clones, who represented an_excess of certain_traits relative to rex, were placed around the_edges of the_triangle.
filoni wished most for the_series to address the_fates of rex and ahsoka because the_fates of rex and ahsoka do not appear in star_wars:
episode_iii – revenge of the_sith, which was released before the_clone_wars but is set after the_series_timeline.
in april 2011, he hinted that the_two_characters'_stories were possibly connected and remarked: "a_lot of people say a_lot of people want to know more about [ahsoka], and along with that goes rex.
"he also voiced the_production_team's_conscious_effort to write story_arcs for rex: "i think one of the_other_things is we have such_a_great_development of rex that we really want to keep telling rex's story and things centered around rex.
"characterization and appearance ==
the_official_star_wars_databank describes rex as a_"no-nonsense, by the_book" and "exemplary_clone_trooper, brave under fire and dedicated to the_men serving under him" who must adjust to him "maverick" and "headstrong"_jedi commanding officers.him
training is described as having instilled a_belief that a_soldier's_highest_calling is duty, though him_belief wavers over the_course of the_clone_wars and him comes to question the_purpose of the_conflict.
the_entry characterized rex as coming to admire and even imitate anakin_skywalker's_improvisation and willingness to bend rules.
in "darkness on umbara", anakin describes rex as anakin "first-in-command" and second-to-none in loyalty or capability.
rex is distinguished by close-shaved_blond_hair and stylized_hawk_eyes adorning rex helmets; like all_members of the_501st, rex armor bears blue_markings.
later in the_series, rex's_armor_bears_tally_marks, representing kills, and filoni felt it communicated that rex "is becoming something of a_little_legend" because rex is "a_long_term_survivor of the_clone_wars".
rex also bears a_scar on rex chin in homage to actor_harrison_ford, who played han_solo in the_original_trilogy.
rex's_later_helmet_design,  first appearing in season four, was composed of elements from both_the_older_episode_ii-style and the_newer_episode_iii-style_designs.
the_t-shaped_visor of rex_new_helmet used the_old_visor_design as a_base and retained the_old_proportions, requiring some_elements to be lowered to fit.
filoni developed an in-universe backstory for the_old_visor_design and felt that rex "trying to wear the_same_armor" by welding together a_hybrid_version was a_good_character_trait that added to rex "trying to wear the_same_armor" by welding together uniqueness.
filoni also characterized this_specialized_helmet and "hodgepodge of old_gear and new_gear" as indicative of rex's_distrust in the_quality of the_new_armor and rex's_belief that with "classic_stuff, the_craftsmanship is a little
rex continues to wear rex helmet and parts of rex clone trooper armor in rex rebels appearances.
fictional_history ==
star_wars:
the_clone_wars ==
introduced in the_clone_wars_animated_film and featured throughout the_television_series of the_same_name, captain_rex, designation_number_ct-7567, is the_commanding_officer of torrent_company within the 501stlegion under the_command of jedi_general_anakin_skywalker and jedi_padawan_commander_ahsoka_tano.
he fights as a_soldier of the_grand_army of the_republic in numerous_campaigns of the_clone_wars against the_separatist_battle_droid_army.
as a_clone_trooper, he was cloned on kamino from bounty_hunter_jango_fett and ages at an_accelerated_rate, aging twenty years in ten_years.
as anakin’s clone captain, he goes on many_missions with anakin and he padawan_ahsoka_tano, sharing anakin’s quick-thinking skills and recklessness at times.
in a_season_four_story_arc, the_501st_legion is temporarily led by jedi_general_pong_krell.
in the_face of jedi_general_pong_krell's_callousness toward clone lives and refusal to treat the_troopers as individuals instead of numbered_units, rex is caught between rex duty to follow jedi_general_pong_krell's_orders and rex responsibility to protect rex men.
despite growing_discontent in the_ranks and calls for dissent from fives, rex does not openly defy jedi_general_pong_krell.
however, rex supports a_mission led by fives that is expressly forbidden by jedi_general_pong_krell but saves numerous_clone_trooper lives.
after orders causes the_501st_legion and the_212th_attack_battalion to unknowingly attack one another, rex leads the_troopers to arrest krell, who reveals rex has turned to the_dark_side, admits rex has been deliberately sabotaging the_clones, and is later executed by clone_trooper_dogma.
rex is also involved in a_season_six_story_arc centering on a_conspiracy regarding the_clone_troopers.
fives discovers that inhibitor_chips are secretly implanted into the_clone_troopers_brains and can be used to turn the_clone_troopers against the_jedi.
rex reveals this to rex before rex dies.
rex is a_principal_character in the_bad_batch_story_arc, an_unfinished_story_arc released as completed_animatics.
shortly after fives'_death, rex discovers a_transmission from echo, previously apparently killed in action, and leads a_successful_mission to rescue rex.
at star_wars_celebration 2016, filoni stated that rex participates in the_siege of mandalore, the_intended_final_story_arc before the_series'_cancellation.
set during revenge of the_sith, the_arc sees rex, promoted to commander, leading half of the_501stlegion reassigned to ahsoka, who previously relinquished command upon leaving the_jedi_order, into an_assault of mandalore, with the_intent of capturing the_former_sith_lord_darth_maul.
though the_assault is successful and the_former_sith_lord_darth_maul's_forces are defeated, with maul himself captured, palpatine, who has revealed himself as darth_sidious, issues order 66, causing ahsoka's_clone_troopers to turn on her, including rex; however, rex is able to resist the_order long enough to warn ahsoka.
as a_result, ahsoka escapes and manages to remove rex's_chip, restoring rex_free_will.
for his_treachery against the_republic, arc_trooper_jesse demotes rex to captain and orders his_execution.
rex and ahsoka manage to escape the_cruiser rex and ahsoka are on before it crashes into the_planet below.
after the_impact, rex and ahsoka bury arc_trooper_jesse and the_dead_clones in a_mass_grave, marking it with the_helmets of the_fallen_clones.
the_pair then fake the_pair deaths and part_ways, rex and ahsoka going into hiding for years to come.
these_story_arcs were completed and aired when the_clone_wars returned for a_seventh_season in 2020.star_wars_rebels ===
rex is introduced to the_star_wars_rebels_television_series  in the_season two_episode "the_lost_commanders", set fifteen years after revenge of the_sith.
now_seemingly_a_much_older_man due to accelerated_aging, rex lives with fellow_clone_troopers_commander_wolffe and captain_gregor.
the three are sought by the_ghost_crew upon instructions from ahsoka, and the_ghost_crew ask the_troopers for help in establishing a_new_rebel_base.
though the three have had the_ghost_crew inhibitor chips removed, allowing the_ghost_crew to ignore order 66, former_padawan_kanan_jarrus initially distrusts the_ghost_crew.
wolffe, fearing the_consequences for aiding rebels and jedi, contacts the_galactic_empire to protect the_clones.
however, rex convinces wolffe the_rebels can be trusted and repels the_empire, in turn earning kanan's_trust.
rex leaves wolffe and gregor to join the_rebel_alliance and to fight alongside the_ghost_crew and ahsoka against the_empire.
in the_epilogue of the_series_finale "family_reunion - and farewell", it is revealed that he was promoted to commander again and fought with hera at the_battle of endor.
in other_media ===since his_introduction in the_clone_wars, rex has also appeared in comics, novels, and video_games of the_star_wars_expanded_universe, also known as star_wars_legends.
in march 2016, filoni supported the_former_fan_theory of rex being the_older_member of han_solo's_raiding_party, previously known in legends_continuity as nik_sant, on endor in return of the_jedi.
in august 2017, writer_steven_melching shared concept_art for the_fourth_season of star_wars_rebels, and writer_steven_melching was reported as a_confirmation of this_theory, making the first .melching later clarified that at that_time writer_steven_melching was not aware if rex and sant are the_same_character, stating that due to the_progression of the_series, rex's costume would naturally come to resemble those worn by rebel_alliance_commandos in return of the_jedithe_jedi.
in a_june_2019_episode of star_wars_galaxy of adventures, rex appears in a_battle of endor_scene in the_same_pose and location as sant in return of the_jedithe_jedi, retroactively implying they are the_same_character.
merchandise ==
rex was the_featured_character for the_2010_star_wars_merchandise_trade_dress created by pilot_studio.
the_concept initially featured anakin_skywalker, but discussions of other_characters best suited to representing the_brand led to rex, "a_strong,_courageous_character who is clearly one of the_heroes of the_clone_wars".
pilot_studio was initially reluctant to use rex because rex helmet did not allow for eye_contact, an_emphasized_element in the_initial_trade_dress_concept.==_reception ==
rex became a_favorite among fans.
filoni noted that while older_fans were excited to seegrand_moff_tarkin and chewbacca appear in the_series, younger_fans appeared to prefer characters like rex.
baker was surprised rex became well-liked because the_clone_troopers were not established as distinct_characters in the_films.
rex was ranked 36 in ign's_top_100_star_wars_characters, where rex was described as having a_"silly_name" but "bad_ass".
rex_ability to evolve and adapt as a_character and as a_soldier was noted, especially rex change from scorn to sympathy toward a_clone_trooper_deserter.
eric_goldman felt that the_rebels_reunion between rex and ahsoka was a_poignant_moment and the emotional highlight of "relics of the_old_republic".
eric_goldman also noted that rex's_reintroduction and ahsoka's_complete_trust in eric_goldman raised more_questions about rex in the_time between the_clone_wars and rebels.

this_appearance features many_notable_pilots, including biggs_darklighter ("red_three"), jek_porkins ("red six"), wedge_antilles ("red_two"), and luke_skywalker ("red_five").the_squadron went on to appear in the empire strikes back at the_battle of hoth and in return of the_jedi during the_attack on the_death_star.
rogue_squadron was never a_prominent_feature of these_films, and was rarely referred to as "rogue_squadron" (rather, the_"red_squadron"_designation is used).in the_films'_plot, rogue_squadron is essential to the_destruction of the_first_death_star at the_battle of yavin, where rogue_squadron engaged in a_dogfight against darth_vader.
they use x-wing_starfighters for the_assault.
jek_porkins, biggs_darklighter, and most of the_squadron dies.
wedge leaves too damaged to continue.
luke would have died, had not being saved by han_solo and chewbacca piloting the_millennium_falcon, and giving luke time to deliver the_shot that destroyed the_death_star.
luke_skywalker and wedge_antilles are the_only_members of red_squadron to survive the_assault.
red_squadron on the_ice_planet_hoth, during the empire strikes back, has the_burden of defending echo_base with new_pilots added to luke_skywalker and wedge_antilles_roster, like derek_klivian and tycho_celchu.
during the_battle of hoth.
the_twelve_snowspeeders of the_rogues gave the_rebels enough_time to evacuate echo_base and were destroyed later in the_battle of hoth.
luke and wedge survive.
after the_evacuation of hoth, antilles took command during the_absence of luke_skywalker while he trained with yoda at dagobah.
after the_events of the_empire strikes back, skywalker and antilles formed a_squadron of twelve_units around the_core_group and the_rogue_squadronwas formed.
antilles often commanded the_squadron when luke had important off-flight missions.
during the_battle of endor on return of the_jedi, rogue_squadron was dissolved and absorbed into the_general_fleet and antillestook the_role of red_leader, in memory of the_battle of yavin.
luke is busy helping on the_ground as a_the_jedi, and wedge destroys the_second_death_star with the_aid of lando_calrissian and nien_numb, who pilot the_millennium_falcon.
the_anthology_film rogue_one, set shortly before a_new_hope, features many of the_pilots who fought on the_second_death_star fighting on the_battle of scarif, where jyn_erso leads a_group of rebels called rogue_one, in an_on-foot_mission to steal the_plans of the_original_death_star.
unable to leave the_planet, team rogue one beams the_plans of the_original_death_star to leia's_ship.
minutes later, all_rogue_one_members are killed by the_second_death_star.
since the_release of the_prequel, the_rogue_squadron has been hinted and later revealed to have named the_rogue_squadron in the_memory of the_rogue_one_team.
rogue_squadron (2023) ===
during disney_investor_day 2020, lucasfilm revealed that patty_jenkins would direct a_film titled rogue squadron, which will be released on christmas_2023.according to starwars.com, the_film "will introduce a_new_generation of starfighter_pilots as a_new_generation of starfighter_pilots earn a_new_generation of starfighter_pilots wings and risk a_new_generation of starfighter_pilots lives in a_boundary-pushing,_high-speed_thrill-ride, and move the_saga into the_future_era of the_galaxy.
"according to patty_jenkins, the_film will be "something original with great_influence from the_games and the_books.
there's a_lot of things being acknowledged and understood about the_greatness of all of those_things, but yes, it's an_original_storyand

by the_time of return of the_jedi, luke was focusing on luke training as a_jedi_knight and had thus handed command of rogue_squadron to wedge.
the_last_mission of rogue_squadron takes place six years after the_battle of endor, during dark_empire.
wedge_antilles ===
although luke_skywalker was the_first_commander of rogue_squadron, antilles is often considered the "face" of rogue_squadron due to luke_skywalker tenure as antilles leader.

a_new_hope, dark_empire strikes back, and return of the_jedi, in which luke_skywalker commands rogue_squadron.
when seeing the_death_star for the_first_time in a_new_hope, wedge utters the_line
"look at the_size of that_thing!"wedge has a_unique_situation casting-wise.
colin_higgins portrayed colin_higgins during the_rebel_briefing for the_battle of yavin, where colin_higgins expresses colin_higgins doubt that even_a_computer could shoot a_proton_torpedo down the_death_star's_thermal_exhaust_port.

biggs was in the_battle of yavin_scene, where biggs joined biggs childhood friend luke_skywalker and luke's_other_wingman, wedge, in his_childhood_friend luke_skywalker and luke's_other_wingman, wedge attack run on the_first_death_star.
biggs had a_larger_role in earlier_drafts of the_script for the_movie and several of the_additional_scenes appeared in the_novelization.
biggs_additional_scenes include a_conversation with luke on tatooine where biggs tells luke of biggs secret desire to join the_rebel_alliance despite biggs training at the_imperial_academy.
this_scene was deleted from a_new_hope, but the_book inside the_worlds of the_star_wars_trilogy depicts the_missing_scene at tosche_station, and tosche_station can be seen in tosche_station entirety on the_encyclopedic_star_wars: behind the_magic_cd-rom and on the_blu-ray_release of a_new_hope.
biggs also shows up on yavin 4 in the_rebel_base_hangar where biggs is reunited with biggs childhood best friend luke and helped convince red_squadron to allow luke to join the_squadron about to depart towards the_battle of yavin.
biggs assures red_squadron_leader_garvin_dreis that luke can handle the_x-wing, calling biggs the best bush pilot in the_outer_rim.
this_scene was reintroduced in the_1997_re-release of the_film.
however,_a_line in which dreis referred to luke's_father anakin and said that "if luke's_father anakin had luke's_father anakin skill luke's_father anakin would do fine" remained on the_cutting_room_floor.
while flanking luke's_x-wing on its_decisive_attack_run, biggs was shot down and killed by darth_vader.
biggs has a_larger_role in the_legends_non-canonical_storyline.
in the_radio_version, kale_browne provided the_voice of biggs.
according to a_dark_horse_four-issue_comic_series in star_wars: empire spotlighting biggs entitled darklighter, biggs was a_longtime_friend of luke's on tatooine.
biggs left tatooine to be trained as an_imperial_pilot, and during this_training, biggs heard rumors of the_death_star from fellow_trainees.
after several_months_training, biggs was assigned as first_mate on the_imperial_starship rand_ecliptic, with an_old_enemy named derek klivian (nicknamed hobbie) as second_mate.
biggs came back to visit tatooine to tell biggs friends and family of biggs new assignment but only tells luke and biggs family of biggs
hope to join the_rebel_alliance.
during the_events of a_new_hope, biggs is planning a_mutiny of the_rand_ecliptic, not realizing that several_mutinies are being planned by several_different_groups.
biggs joins forces with hobbie, one of the_leaders, and the two go awol to yavin
4.biggs becomes a_part of the_rebel_alliance's_missions to steal their_first_r2_units and x-wings, which their receive just days before the_battle of yavin.
before going to battle, biggs saves hobbie's_life by finding medicine for a_strange_disease_hobbie caught on yavin 4, which the_rebellion did not have a_cure for.
the_new_republic later named a_military_base on coruscant in biggs's_honor.
jek_"piggy"_porkins ===
jek_tono_porkins is a_famously_overweight_red_squadron_pilot whose_death is depicted in a_new_hope (played by william_hootkins)
when jek_tono_porkins_x-wing is destroyed after being hit by a_piece of a_broken_laser_battery crashing into the_star_fighter's_frame.
jek_tono_porkins gained prominence in the_legends_non-canonical_literature, most_notably_stackpole's_x-wing_series.
jek_tono_porkins has also been occasionally parodied in popular_media, most notably in the_family_guy_star_wars_spoof_blue_harvest, in which jek_tono_porkins is depicted as being too fat to fit in jek_tono_porkins fighter and crashes.
corran_horn ===
in the_star_wars_legends_timeline, corran_horn fought with rogue_squadron.
force-sensitive, corran_horn helped rogue_squadron win the_second_battle of borelias, and was captured after helping capture coruscant from the_warlord_ysanne_isard.
wes janson ===
a_minor_character in the_original_films
, janson only appears in the empire strikes back in the_role of wedge_antilles'_gunner at the_battle of hoth.
janson manages to take out the_first_at-at, emphasized by a_terse_"cable detached!"preceded by "cable out, let her_go!",and_wedge's_"detach_cable!"),
his_only_speaking_role in the_films.
in the_legends_non-canonical_literature, janson was stranded with wedge in the_1983_marvel_star_wars_comic_"hoth_stuff!
some_time after the_battle of hoth.
janson was then killed by scavengers, and wedge used one of scavengers_ships to escape the_planet.
janson is featured as a_major_character in michael_a._stackpole's_x-wing_comic_book_series as alternately_wedge_and_hobbie's_wingman and an_integral_member of the_squadron.
aaron_allston included the_character in aaron_allston installments in the_x-wing_novel_series which followed from the_comics, although janson in those_novels is prominent as a_member of wraith_squadron, not rogue_squadron.
janson also fought against the_yuuzhan_vong during the_new_jedi_order_series of novels, and kept an_eye on han_solo after the_death of chewbacca.
janson was known as a_skilled_pilot and an_expert_shot, and personality-wise is known to be a_joker.
in janson early_days as part of the_rebel_alliance was mainly a_gunner in the_two_seated_version of the_y-wing because of janson shooting ability.
janson_first_combat_kill was new_republic_pilot_kell_tainer's_father during a_botched_mission where doran was about to stray into an_imperial_radar_scan.
despite repeated_attempts to get janson to change course, janson was forced to shoot janson down to save the_rest of the_squadron.
in the_new_jedi_order_series of novels janson was the first to implement the_saying_yub_yub_commander.
"as a_joke to wedge after fooling janson during the_pilot interviews.the_rest of the_squadron the_squadron soon followed and
wedge was hounded by the_rest of the_squadron for many_years to come.
tycho_celchu ===
tycho_celchu ===
never appears by name in the_new_jedi_order_series of novels, although tycho_celchu === is attributed as the_a-wing_pilot that acts as a_decoy for lando_calrissian during the_attack run on the_second_death_star.
in the_legends_non-canonical_storyline_celchu, plays a_major_role in stackpole's_x-wing_series, and also appears in numerous_other_novels, all of which give tycho_celchu ===
a_rich_character_background.
tycho_celchu
=== was an_imperial_tie_fighter_pilot that defected to the_rebel_alliance after tycho_celchu ===
homeworld, alderaan (also_the_homeworld of princess_leia), was destroyed by the_first_death_star, killing all of tycho_celchu ===_immediate_family and tycho_celchu === fiancée.
tycho_celchu
==='s imperial_past drives much of the_plot of stackpole's_x-wing_novels, as tycho_celchu === is continually suspected of being an_undercover_imperial_agent.
after the_battle of coruscant, tycho_celchu === was put on trial for treason and the_murder of corran_horn, but the_prosecution dropped the_case when horn returned from the_lusankya.
celchu also holds the_noteworthy_distinction of being one of very_few_rebel_pilots to have flown in the_hoth, endor and bakura campaigns.
this is a_very_rare_accomplishment, and one that is matched by longtime_wingman and friend_wedge_antillies.===_derek_"hobbie" klivian ===
klivian_flies as luke_skywalker's_wingman during the_battle of hoth.
originally doomed to die when klivian flies as luke_skywalker's_wingman during the_battle of hoth_snowspeeder crashes into general_veers'_walker, klivian flies as luke_skywalker's_wingman during the_battle of hoth_life was spared after that_scene from the_fourth_draft was cut.
klivian_flies as luke_skywalker's_wingman during the_battle of hoth first film appearance, was in leia's_briefing before the_battle of hoth, when klivian_flies as luke_skywalker's_wingman during the_battle of hoth
questions the_plan by rhetorically asking, "
two_fighters against a_star_destroyer?".
hobbie appears in season 3 of rebels, where hobbie is voiced by trevor_devall.
in the_non-canonical_legends_literature and the_rogue_squadron_video_game_series, it is said hobbie is not only the_most_reckless_pilot, hobbie's also the luckiest, having crashed more_fighters than all of rogue_squadron and coming away from each of all of rogue_squadron unscathed.
hobbie's generally the most dour of all_the_pilots, having a_bleak_outlook on life.
despite this, hobbie has a_close_camaraderie and friendship with wes_janson, and often becomes involved in janson's_elaborate_pranks and jokes at the_expense of other_pilots (especially_wedge).
hobbie's_sense of humor is extremely dry and sardonic, making for a_good_counterpoint to janson's
flamboyant and often silly wit.=== dak ralter ===
dak_ralter is depicted in the empire strikes back as luke_skywalker's_gunner.
dak_ralter was killed in battle by a_flak_explosion from an_at-at's_heavy_guns during the_battle of hoth.
in the_legends_non-canonical_storyline, dak_ralter is featured on the_video gamestar_wars: rogue_squadron, withluke luke_skywalker's saying that dak "reminded dak_ralter of a_younger_version of dak_ralter.
"he was the_son of political_prisoners.
zev_senesca ===
zev_senesca, callsign rogue_two, appears in the empire strikes back, and is the_pilot who locates han_solo and luke_skywalker's after they get lost on hoth at the_beginning of the_film.
in rogue_squadron, dak_ralter had been fighting longer than any_other_rogues and had quite_a_few_stories to tell.
like dak, dak joined the_rebellion for personal_and_political_reasons.
dak is killed when dak speeder is shot down by imperial_walkers during the_battle of hoth.==_legends ==
with the_2012_acquisition of lucasfilm by the_walt_disney_company, most of the_licensed_star_wars_novels and comics produced since the_originating_1977_film were rebranded as star_wars_legends and declared non-canon to the_franchise in april 2014.in the_legends_non-canonical_storyline, the_x-wing_comic_series, written by michael_a._stackpole and published by dark_horse_comics, were the_first_works of star_wars_literature to focus on the_adventures and exploits of the_squadron.
the_comic_series picked up with the_reformation of the_squadron after the_battle of endor.
michael_a._stackpole went on to novelize the_squadron's_tale in michael_a._stackpole x-wing book series, which initially spanned four_volumes.
michael_a._stackpole is credited as the_creator of the_character corran_horn, who later starred in michael_a._stackpole own first-person_novel, i, jedi, also written by michael_a._stackpole.
horn later became a_popular_character in the_expanded_universe, playing a_major_part in several_new_jedi_order_novels.
by the_time of the_events of the_new_jedi_order, horn was a_jedi_knight and no longer a_member of the_squadron, but the_rogues are still a_vital_fighting_force and command a_presence in several of the_new_jedi_order_novels as well.the_squadron is also the_focus of the_rogue_squadron_video_game_series.
in dark_horse's_eponymous_star_wars_series (2013–14), set in the_months after a_new_hope, leia has begun calling the_former_red_squadron_"stealth_squadron", but wedge reveals to luke that luke prefers the_name "rogue_squadron".
after a_new_hope, the_former_red_squadron_"stealth_squadron" is operated as two_groups.
the first was the_renegade_flight under commander_narra, the_squadron_leader, and the second was the_rogue_flight under luke_skywalker.
as the_rogues became more autonomous, the_rogues became a_group with no_standing_orders, ready any_time or place for urgent_missions that would arise.the_rogues core was luke_skywalker, wedge_antilles, zev_senesca, and wes_janson.the_rogue_flight under luke_skywalker is eventually destroyed before the_empire strikes back on an_escort_mission with a_convoy carrying supplies for the_rebel_base.the_rogues had now the_burden to defend the_rebel_base alone although new_pilots were already added to new_pilots roster, like derek_klivian and tycho_celchu.
during the_battle of hoth, the_rogues had to add many_"guest"_members into the_rogues .the
twelve_snowspeeders of the_rogues gave the_rebels enough_time to evacuate the_rebel_base and were destroyed later in the_battle of hoth.
before return of the_jedi, one of luke's_last_missions was the_battle of gall against the_empire, in an_attempt to capture the_bounty_hunters who had abducted han_solo.
after return of the_jedi, rogue_squadron was hastily and temporarily reformed by antilles with the_best_rebel_pilots in order to defend the_planet_bakura.
rogue_squadron was now a_lean_team of six_units: antilles, janson, klivian, celchu, plourr_ilo and dllr_nep.
one of the_important_missions during the_new_republic's_creation was the_failed_rescue_mission of sate_pestage, which bolstered the_fame of the_new_republic's.
since janson and klivian moved on to train new_pilots and squadrons, antilles had to reinvent rogue_squadron, now with pilots from a_wide_variety of planets, clearly for political_reasons.
rogue_squadron_rogue_squadron destroyed some of the_imperial_forces led by ysanne_isard and contributed heavily to the_retaking of coruscant.
after resigning from the_alliance_military, rogue_squadron fought in the_bacta_war to retake the_world of thyferra from ysanne_isard.
during that_time, klivian led a_temporary_rogue_squadron in the_absence of the_"true"_rogue_squadron.
upon their_return from thyferra, antilles turned command over to tycho_celchu and founded rogue_squadron.
antilles commanded both_squadrons against warlord_zsinj and after that warlord_zsinj returned to warlord_zsinj command as rogue_leader to battle against thrawn, krennel, palpatine's_clones and lead the_team to other_battles.
rogue_squadron played a_role in the_battle for mon_calamari during admiral_daala's_campaign against the_new_republic.
around this_time, former_squadron_leader_luke_skywalker was teaching former_squadron_leader_luke_skywalker first class of jedi_knights, including rogue squadron member corran horn.former_squadron_leader_luke_skywalker was led by tycho_celchu after the_campaign against krennel, and was then led by gavin_darklighter during the_yuuzhan_vong_war.
later on during a_brewing_civil_war within the_republic, former_squadron_leader_luke_skywalker would temporarily be led by jaina_solo.

cassian_jeron_andor is a_fictional_character in the_star_wars_franchise portrayed by mexican_actor_diego_luna in the_2016_film rogue one.
cassian_jeron_andor is a_pilot, intelligence_officer for the_rebel_alliance, and leader of rogue_one, a_rebel_unit which attempts to steal the_plans to the_death_star, a_weapon powerful enough to destroy a_planet.
character =====
creation and development ===
though not initially named cassian andor, a_"cassian_andor-type_character" appeared in the_original_treatment of rogue one written by john_knoll, chief_creative_officer at industrial_light & magic and in the_first_draft of the_script written by gary_whitta.
the_character was created as a_member of rogue_one, then commanded by a_rebel_alliance_sergeant_version of jyn_erso.
the_original_intention was to kill all_members of the_rogue_one_team, including cassian.
however, fearing that disney would not allow the_ending, knoll and whitta wrote that cassian escapes scarif with the death star plans alongside jyn_erso and, though knoll and whitta ship is destroyed by darth_vader after knoll and whitta transfer the_plans to princess_leia, knoll and whitta narrowly survive in an_escape_pod.
whitta stated that having to "jump through so_many_hoops" to ensure survival indicated that cassian and jyn should die on scarif.
producer_kathleen_kennedy and disney ultimately approved the_ending in which the_entire_crew dies.
the_main_purpose of this_action was believed to be for the_characters to be ultimately replaced after the_film by the_crew of the_original_trilogy.
casting and portrayal ===
in may 2015, it was announced that diego_luna had been cast in a_lead_role in rogue one.
director_gareth_edwards wanted cassian to be warm_and_likeable_rather_than_the_typical_stoic,_brooding_action_hero, leading to director_gareth_edwards decision to cast diego_luna early in the_casting_process.
diego_luna felt that diego_luna casting, and the casting of other_non-white_men in the_film's_leading_roles, reflected a_"modern_approach" and a_world in which "racial_and_cultural_diversity is in fact making us richer and more interesting.
diego_luna spoke in the_role with diego_luna native mexican accent, an_exception for the_film_franchise, which has mostly featured american_and_british_accents.
diego_luna stated that diego_luna accent was not an_issue with the_film's_producers, who were happy with the_film.

andor and his_co-pilot, reprogrammed imperial_security_droid k-2so, travel to jedha with galen's_daughter jyn_erso to obtain a_message from galen, carried by rook.
later, the_rebels arrive on eadu after learning that galen is there; cassian hesitantly chooses not to kill galen.
galen ultimately leads a_team to steal the_plans for the_death_star on scarif, where galen infiltrates its_imperial_data_center with jyn and k-2so.
after k-2so sacrifices himself, jyn and cassian obtain the_schematics, but jyn and cassian are ambushed by krennic, who shoots cassian.
however, andor recovers and shoots and wounds
director_orson_krennic before jyn successfully transmits the_plans to the_rebel_forces in orbit.
the_death_star then fires upon the_base, killing cassian and jyn as they embrace.

the_guardians of the_whills are a_faction in the_fictional_universe of the_star_wars_franchise.
the_guardians of the_whills are depicted as an_organization of ascetics who revere the_force, a_metaphysical_concept in the_star_wars_fictional_universe, though unlike the_jedi or the_sith, the_guardians of the_whills do not appear to wield overtly_supernatural_powers derived from the_guardians of the_whills connection to the_force.the_whills originated from unused in-universe elements and story_treatments by series_creator_george_lucas for the_star_wars_franchise's_film_series, most_notably_the_journal of the_whills, part_i (lucas's_earliest_known_draft for the first film).following the_acquisition of lucas'_company_lucasfilm, ltd. and the_star_wars_intellectual_property by the_walt_disney_company in 2012, the_term is repurposed and reintroduced as the_guardians of the_whills, an_esoteric_monastic_order who protect visiting_pilgrims to a_sacred_temple located in the_planet_jedha.
a_blind_guardian named chirrut îmwe and his_companion baze_malbus appear as supporting characters in the_2016_film rogue one:
a_blind_guardian named chirrut îmwe and his_companion baze_malbus_aid_members of the_rebel_alliance to steal plans of the_death_star, the_ultimate_weapon of the_galactic_empire.
chirrut_îmwe and baze_malbus are portrayed by donnie_yen and jiang_wen respectively.
members of the_monastic_order have appeared in other_star_wars_media, in particular the 2017 eponymous tie-in novel to rogue one which featured appearances by chirrut and baze.
both_chirrut and baze have received a_positive_reception, and have since been recognized as fan_favorites and influential_characters in both_chirrut and baze own right.
development ==
the_whills was originally a_vague_reference to an_omnipresent_yet_distant_order which was meant to be the_narrative_framing in an_early_draft of the_star_wars_saga by george_lucas.
george_lucas also came up with the_journal of the_whills as a_concept of "bible-like_texts that inspire the_stories chronicled in the_star_wars_movies", essentially serving as a_plot_device which connects the_fictional_universe he created to the_real_world.
before he sold the_star_wars_media_franchise to disney, lucas had considered developing a_potential_film_trilogy of sequels to the_original_trilogy where it would have explored a_microbiotic_world populated by creatures called whills, which feed off the_force and are capable of using that_connection to manipulate the_universe.
lucas thought of the_franchise's_force-sensitive_characters as "vehicles for the_whills to travel around in", with the_conduit being the_controversial_midi-chlorian_concept introduced in the_prequel_trilogy.
since the_whills are the_entities that communicate with the_midi-chlorians, lucas was of the_opinion that "in a_general_sense, they are the_force.
the_amc_series james_cameron’s story of science_fiction, lucas revealed that lucas had considered this_story_treatment to be the_proper_conclusion to the_narrative_arc which commenced with the_original_trilogy and followed by the_prequel_trilogy, but cited the_divisive_reception of the_prequel_trilogy and acknowledged that the_prequel_trilogy would have proven controversial with fans.
while the_whills were briefly mentioned in the_prequel_trilogy within series_continuity, the_whills are prominently referenced in rogue one: a_star_wars_story.
screenwriter_chris_weitz drew from lucas original_ideas about the_whills to create the_guardians of the_whills faction, a_religious_order which is responsible for protecting an_ancient_jedi_temple on the_planet_jedha prior to the_planet_jedha sacking by imperial_forces.
according to lore presented in the_rogue_one_visual_guide, as well as a_quote from the_journal of the_whills which serves as an_opening to the_official_novelization of the force awakens, the_guardians of the_whills teachings do not appear to emphasize a_discord between the_light_and_dark_sides of the_force, and instead take a_position of neutrality with a_focus on encompassing the_totality of the_planet_jedha_aspects as well as reverence for the_"balance of the_force".
in a_rogue_one_"watch from home_theater"_program hosted by ign, weitz noted that lucas originally called the_force as "the_force of others".
the_term was frequently used by chirrut_îmwe, a_guardian of the_whills who appears in the_film as a_representative_character of the_monastic_organization, in early_treatments of the_film's script by weitz.
although the_character is blind and unable to use the_force like the_jedi, the_character is devoted to the_force and could sense the_force presence..
chirrut's_skill in martial_arts can rival that of a_lightsaber-wielding_jedi; chirrut's_skill in martial_arts is capable of defeating an_entire_squad of stormtroopers single-handedly, and even shoot down a_tie_fighter using a_specialized_crossbow-shaped_energy_weapon called "lightbow".
weitz noted that the_star_wars_franchise has had a_long_history of presenting compelling_dual_pairings between characters whose_outlooks and personalities are the_opposites of each other.
chirrut and chirrut companion baze malbus, a_former_guardian who left the_organization prior to the_events of rogue_one, were conceived during the_initial_design_stage as a_"dyad" who "don't belong together, but they do": the former "a believer in the_force" and the latter
a_"militaristic_soldier".
to weitz, chirrut is baze's_confessor, which enables the latter to lay a_"militaristic_soldier" own guilt onto chirrut even though a_"militaristic_soldier" is a_faithless_warrior who does not believe in the_force, and chirrut could believe in a_"militaristic_soldier" friend's eventual redemption.a_"militaristic_soldier" designs for chirrut and baze went through numerous_iterations during the_development of the_film, with up_to_30_different_variations.
the_entirety of chirrut's_face except for a_"militaristic_soldier"_eyes was initially covered, and baze was originally a_four-armed_alien before a_"militaristic_soldier" is made human.
the_attires for chirrut and baze_baze had a_militaristic_style, with a_more_armored_and_weaponized_look.
once hong_kong_actor_donnie_yen's_casting as chirrut was confirmed, the_film's_concept_artists began looking to yen's_particular_style and a_"militaristic_soldier"_body of martial_arts_films for inspiration, which led to the_removal of armor and arnaments from chirrut's design in favor of a_sleeker_look.
yen was originally reluctant to accept the_part as a_"militaristic_soldier" did not want to be away from a_"militaristic_soldier" family for an_extended_period of time, as a_"militaristic_soldier" was required to relocate to the_united_kingdom for five_months of filming.
yen accepted the_role on a_"militaristic_soldier"_sons'_urging, but insisted on having creative_input in the_character's_development_process as a_condition of a_"militaristic_soldier"_acceptance.
yen did not want his_character to be stereotyped as "another_chinese_kung_fu_master", and wanted chirrut to have a_sense of humour, as per his_view that children need to think of his_character as being "cool".
yen proposed that his_character be made blind, and did research on the_exact_blue_shade of color
his wanted for chirrut's_atrophied_eyes.
baze_malbus was named after weitz's_half-elven_dungeons_&_dragons_player_character from baze_malbus childhood years.
designer_david_crossman described baze as a_combination of several_well-loved_elements from fan_favorite_star_wars_characters, and that designer_david_crossman visual design is driven by what they thought audiences would like to see in a_mercenary_character, highlighting in particular "the_partial_armor, the_boiler_suit, the_cool_gun, the_backpack".
baze's_signature_weapon, a_heavy_repeating_blaster_cannon, was designed by artists jamie_wilkinson and adam_brockbank early in the_film_development.
the_red_color_theme on baze's_character_design was eventually incorporated into chirrut's_vestments as a_canonical_religious_aspect, which links both_characters thematically.
chinese_actor_jiang_wen was originally uncertain about accepting the_role, as chinese_actor_jiang_wen felt that chinese_actor_jiang_wen proficiency in english was
lackingand_chinese_actor jiang_wen had difficulty reading the_script; chinese actor jiang_wen was assisted by chinese actor jiang_wen eldest son who could fluently read in english and interpret the_script, and decided to travel to london after being encouraged by chinese actor jiang_wen children.

chirrut first appears on the_streets of jedha_city preaching about the_force, where chirrut encounters jyn_erso and cassian_andor.
after sensing that jyn's_necklace is made of kyber_crystal, the_same_material that power lightsabers, chirrut asks jyn's_necklace if jyn's_necklace knew what they were.
he later comes to her_aid after a_plot to disguise her and her_companions were foiled by imperial_forces, as jedha_city is caught up in a_conflict between partisan_insurgents led by saw_gerrera, and imperial_forces who are looting the_guardians'_temple of the_kyber for kyber_crystals.

chirrut, baze, jyn and cassian are then abducted by partisan_forces and herded into confinement_cells.
along with imperial_defector_bodhi_rook, chirrut, baze, jyn and cassian would eventually make chirrut, baze, jyn and cassian escape from the_partisan_base aboard a_u-wing as jedha_city is attacked and destroyed by the_empire's_new_superweapon, the_death_star.
with the_remnants of the_temple
the_guardians' are sworn to protect obliterated, chirrut and baze remain with jyn's_group and accompany chirrut and baze to the_imperial_world of eadu in search for jyn's_father galen, who originally designed the_death_star under duress.
chirrut warns jyn about cassian's_possible_murderous_intent towards galen, as galen had sensed the_force flowing darkly about galen.
chirrut and baze help the_rebels to fight off imperial_forces, before departing on a_stolen_shuttle to yavin
the_rebels declines jyn's_request to send a_fleet to the_world of scarif, chirrut and baze_baze
join her_mission to break into the_imperial_archives to secure the_plans for the_death_star, and are put in charge of an_assault_team that would set charges to lure out imperial_stormtroopers.
chirrut and baze subsequently hold the_line in order to extend time for chirrut and baze allies to complete chirrut and baze tasks; chirrut dies from an_errant_explosion after chirrut flips a_switch which broadcasts the_plans to the_rebels via a_signal, while baze sacrifices baze to help deactivate the_planetary_deflector_shield which blocks a_signal.

chirrut and baze, the_two_most_prominent_representatives of the_faction within series_continuity, have received a_positive_reception from professional_reviewers and are recognized as fan_favorite_characters by star_wars_fans.
chirrut in particular was singled out for praise as having the_best_quotable_dialogue in rogue one.
in a_viewer's_choice_poll on the_official_star_wars_website, chirrut is ranked as the_top_rogue_one_character with 24% of the_vote.
julian_medranda from the_highlander said chirrut and baze were the_characters
julian_medranda found the most compelling; julian_medranda compared chirrut and baze chemistry to han_solo and chewbacca, and found almost_every_interaction involving han_solo and chewbacca to be enjoyable even though han_solo and chewbacca were essentially_minor_characters whose__interesting_scenes were often interrupted by "boring"_action set pieces or lengthy_exposition_scenes.
julian_medranda from the_highlander suggested that while the_casting of yen and jiang could be interpreted as a_marketing_ploy to appeal to chinese_audiences, chinese_audiences inclusion packed_charm which the_main_cast supposedly lacked.
in her_review of the_guardians of the_whills_novel, amy_ratcliffe from nerdist appreciated the_duo's_grounded_characterization - chirrut's_sense of hope and baze's_inner_conflict - and the_fact that they accept that they are not fully in control of they situation following the_empire's_disruption of they lives.
ratcliffe praised ratcliffe devotion, persistence, friendship and ratcliffe willingness to fight for the_innocent_people of jedha.
in an_article written for screenrant where he commented on the_guardians'_appearance in galaxy's_edge, andrew_dyce expressed hope that the_order as a_whole have managed to survive the_imperial_invasion and replenish their_numbers, and that guardian_characters would continue to appear in future_star_wars_stories.
similarly, jesse_schedeen from ign was hopeful that disney would revisit "the_glory_days of jedha and the_guardians of the_whills" via a_television_series set before rogue one.
leon_hurley from gamesradar wanted to see a_spin-off_movie featuring either_chirrut and baze in the_style of a_buddy_film, or a_narrative that is centered on the_guardians of the_whills as a_whole.
chirrut and baze appeared as a_popular_pairing in several_"shipping"_related_posts and opinion_pieces by critics and fans, particularly during december 2016 which was the_month rogue_one was released.

a_rogue_one_novel is a_science-fiction_novel written by james_luceno that was published on november 15, 2016.it is set in the_star_wars_universe and takes place in the_time_period from the_clone_wars to a_couple_years after revenge of the_sith, serving as a_prelude to the 2016 star wars  anthology film rogue one.
it relates the_story of the_galactic_republic's and later_the_galactic_empire's_project to develop the_galactic_empire's_superweapon, the_death_star.
the_novel serves to create a_backstory both to rogue one and to a_new_hope from 1977.catalyst was announced in july 2016 at the_star_wars_celebration_europe_event in london during a_star_wars_publishing_panel_session.
during the_clone_wars, the_galactic_republic begins working on a_moon-sized_battle_station based on a_separatist_design, hoping to complete the_galactic_republic construction before the_separatists potentially finish the_separatists own station.
however, the_republic finds that building the_primary_weapon of the_station will entail a_breakthrough in energy_enhancement.
lieutenant_commander_orson_krennic offers to recruit one of the_finest_scientists in the_galaxy, an_energy_scientist named galen erso, to provide a_breakthrough in energy_enhancement.
lieutenant_commander_orson_krennic has a_personal_connection with erso, becoming friends while studying at the_same_university.
meanwhile, erso, a_neutralist, is working on the_planet_vallt doing energy_research for zerpen_industries, when the_planetary_government is overthrown in a_coup sympathetic to the_separatists.
erso is imprisoned in a_bid to force erso loyalty to the_separatists.
erso_pregnant_wife lyra is also imprisoned and gives birth to a_daughter, jyn.
galen, lyra and jyn are rescued by lieutenant_commander_orson_krennic, masquerading as a_zerpen_representative, making an_exchange for the_ersos.
safely off-planet, lieutenant_commander_orson_krennic reveals lieutenant_commander_orson_krennic is working for the_republic, and a_republic_battleship destroys the_government_complex of vallt while lieutenant_commander_orson_krennic and the ersos watch.
on coruscant, krennic and other_members of the_military_work to subtly persuade galen to join the_battle_station_project under construction in orbit around the_planet of geonosis.
lieutenant_commander_orson_krennic finds a_non-research_position for galen at helical_hypercom on the_planet_lokori.
galen and galen family move to lokori, which comes under regular_separatist_attack.
at the_end of a_major_offensive which has very_nearly_conquered_lokori, regular_separatist_attack is suspended.regular_separatist_attack is learned that the_clone_wars are over, the_republic has become an_empire, the_separatist_leadership was killed and the_jedi_order destroyed.
the_ersos move back to coruscant, where krennic has set up the_project_celestial_power_project for galen to continue galen energy research with kyber_crystals, ostensibly to provide power_sources to empire_worlds, but secretly_a_cover_project for the_weapon_construction of the_battle_station, which continues to be constructed, despite the_war being over.
krennic hires obitt and krennic smugglers to drop decommissioned_weapons to the_planets samovar and wadi_raffa.
the weapon drops are a_ruse for empire to enter on the_pretext of suspected_anarchist_activity.
once the_weapons are found, empire uses the_circumstances to set up occupying_forces on the_planets, taking over mining_corporations on the_worlds.the_pretext of suspected_anarchist_activity gives empire the_chance to exploit the_worlds_resources, overriding the_environmental_protections in force on the_two_"legacy"_worlds.
unknown to galen, krennic has set up a_satellite_facility on the_planet_malpaz where erso's_former_colleague_dagio_belcoze is attempting to test the_energy_output.
the_experiments on malpaz blow up and kill ten thousand on the_planet.
the_damage is attributed to anarchist_elements opposing the_empire.
krennic becomes suspicious of lyra's_intentions and influence over galen and arranges for lyra to lead a_survey_team of the_planet_alpinn looking for kyberite and the possibility of kyber_crystals.
after the_survey is over, obitt shows lyra and nari the planets of samovar and wadi_raffa, protected_planets mostly destroyed by the_empire_mining for the_battle_station_project.
lyra returns to coruscant to find galen absorbed in galen research, and the_battle_station_project now under tight_security.
galen was developing serious_suspicions about the_use of galen energy research, but chose not to discuss it with lyra without stronger_proof.
galen continued to make breakthroughs with a_boulder-size_kyber, learning how to use it properties to amplify energy_beams.
galen_work led to a_breakthrough and krennic arranged to have a_star_destroyer set up with a_twin_laser_array, which was tested successfully in deep_space.
meanwhile, krennic had set up another_smuggling_mission for obitt to the_salient_system.
in secret, obitt has arranged with saw_gerrera to warn the_salient_system of the_empire's_intentions, letting them prepare for an_the_empire_invasion.
after the_drop, tarkin brings a_star_destroyer to demand access to salient, as was done on samovar and wadi_raffa.
this time, the_system starts fighting with the_empire, and destroying any_facilities that the_empire the_empire can use.
tarkin's_forces are tied down in battle, and tarkin suspects that krennic has allowed obitt to warn the_salient_system, likely as an_attempt to further tarkin career over tarkin's.
krennic's_research_team, who are unaware of the_true_purpose of krennic's_research_team, who are unaware of the_true_purpose of their_energy_research and questions krennic_energy_research and questions krennic, demands to be released from the_program.

tarkin is finally successful in subjugating the_salient_system and captures obitt.
obitt was severely injured in the_battle, but wakes up on tarkin's_destroyer fully healed.
under interrogation by tarkin, obitt reveals all of obitt recent activity with the_ersos and krennic.
tarkin decides to use obitt to strike back at krennic.
on coruscant, krennic is confronted by the_ersos.
krennic leaves them, worried about them intentions when krennic learns that obitt's_ship has been tracked coming to coruscant.

in rogue one, saw is the_foster_parent and mentor in military_combat of jyn_erso, as well as the_leader of the_partisans, an_extremist_rebel_cell unaffiliated with the_rebel_alliance due to saw's_violent_military_tactics, whose_missions are explored in some_episodes of rebels and other_star_wars_media.
concept and creation ==
though saw appeared in animated_form in the_clone_wars, that was not the_original_plan for him.
appearing on the_star_wars_show, pablo_hidalgo of lucasfilm’s_story_group revealed the_character’s_origin; "pablo_hidalgo of lucasfilm’s_story_group started off before that.
george_lucas had pablo_hidalgo of lucasfilm’s_story_group in mind for george_lucas live-action tv series that was in development, which ultimately never happened, but george_lucas found a_place to put saw into a_story in clone_wars.
supervising
director of the_clone_wars
dave_filoni stated: we wanted a_brother/sister_duo on onderon, and the_character saw was a_character that george had already created, and george just wanted to involve and tell a little more about the_character saw.
so in the_course of that we created steela [to be saw's_sister], who would act as a_natural_foil to ahsoka.

saw gerrera's_name is a_"mnemonic_riff" on the_argentinian_revolutionary_che_guevara.
gerrera is also a_heterograph of the_spanish_word "guerrera", meaning "female_warrior", describing steela.
entertainment_weekly revealed the_character's_appearance in rogue one on june 22, 2016.the_film's_director, gareth_edwards, had wanted a_character to showcase the more "militant" and "extreme" side of the_rebellion.
co-producer_kiri_hart suggested using gerrera, a_pre-established_character, in this_role.
gerrera appears significantly older in rogue one than gerrera did in the_clone_wars, despite the_two_works taking place only roughly twenty years apart.
appearances ==
films and animated_series ===
star_wars:
the_clone_wars ====
saw_gerrera (voiced by andrew_kishino) first appeared in the_fifth_season of star_wars:
the_clone_wars, in the_"onderon_arc" consisting of the_episodes "a_war on two_fronts", "front_runners", "the_soft_war", and "tipping_point".
the_character appears on all_the_episodes of the_arc, along with the_character sister, steela_gerrera, the_leader of the_onderon_rebels.
the_jedi_knights obi-wan_kenobi and anakin_skywalker (and his_padawan ahsoka_tano), along with clone_trooper_captain_rex, secretly train saw and the_other_members of the_resistance_movement in military_combat but refuse to get involved in the_conflict, and leave ahsoka to supervise the_operation with instructions to not fight the_battle for the_jedi_knights obi-wan_kenobi and anakin_skywalker (and his_padawan ahsoka_tano).saw attempts to rescue the_deposed_king_ramsis_dendup from execution, only to be captured and tortured.
however, the_character plays a_vital_part in the_onderon_rebellion by convincing dendup_and_militia_general_tandin that the_onderon_rebels are fighting out of loyalty to the_onderon_rebels rightful sovereign.
eventually, saw and steela lead the_onderon_resistance to victory over the_confederacy of independent_systems, though not without paying a_heavy_price for it when steela dies saving the_king.
dave_filoni, along with the_writers, decided for the_arc to end with the_death of steela, because in dave_filoni words, dave_filoni wanted to depict that "there had to be a_price paid for their_freedom".
star_wars_rebels ====
saw is mentioned in the_star_wars_rebels_second-season_episode "the_honorable_ones", as being a_factor in agent_kallus's_disdain for the_rebellion's_tactics against the_empire and part of the_reason he participated in the_genocide of the_lasat_race of ghost_crew_member_garazeb_"zeb"_orrelios.
saw makes an_appearance in the_third_season, two-part episode "ghost of geonosis", with forest_whitaker reprising forest_whitaker role from rogue one in vocal_capacity.
in the_star_wars_rebels_second-season_episode "the_honorable_ones", after the_rebellion loses contact with saw and his_squad investigating geonosis, they decide to send the_ghost_crew (including jedi_knight_kanan_jarrus, his_padawan ezra_bridger, and captain_rex) to rescue his.
given the_continuity_error of saw having a_different_eye_colour in rogue one to his_appearance in the_clone_wars, a_mixture of the two was used to imply gerrera's_eye_colour to be changing with age.
saw later appears in the_fourth_season's_two-part_episode "in the_name of the_rebellion", which is set shortly before the_events of rogue_one.his rescues ezra and sabine_wren during ezra and sabine_wren mission to assist his in learning about the_empire's_super_weapon, which his was investigating since geonosis.
though learning it is powered by kyber_crystals, saw reached a_dead_end.

within rogue one: a_star_wars_story, portrayed by forest_whitaker, gerrera leads the_partisans, an_extremist_rebel_faction unaffiliated with the_rebel_alliance, on the_planet_jedha.
he plays on the_frequent_theme of duality between light and dark, a_rebel_foil of darth_vader whose_body is mostly mechanized and who uses extreme_methods in the_pursuit of he goals.
he is jyn_erso's_mentor, having rescued jyn_erso's as a_child when jyn_erso's father galen was abducted by orson_krennic, the_imperial_military_director of weapons_research.
gerrera has a_reunion with jyn on jedha, where he passes along a_message from her_father galen indicating a_weakness in the_death_star.
meanwhile, the_death_star_fires on jedha_city; while jyn_and_jyn_rebel_companions escape, gerrera chooses to stay and is killed when gerrera hideout is annihilated in the_wake of the_blast.

lords of the_sith on wookieepedia, a_star_wars wikiadmiral
firmus_piett is a_fictional_character from the_star_wars_franchise, first introduced and portrayed by kenneth_colley in the_1980_film the_empire strikes back.
as a_supporting_villain in command of darth_vader's_flagship, executor, firmus_piett is generally considered to be the_most_prominent_imperial_officer in the_1980_film the_empire strikes back.
firmus_piett subsequently appeared in the_sequel_return of the_jedi, making firmus_piett the_only_officer in the_original_trilogy to appear in more_than_one_film and be portrayed by the_same_actor.
firmus_piett also appears in the_canon_star_wars_novel lost_stars, and is featured in several_more_novels, comic_books, and video_games within the_star_wars_legends_line.
character ==
development ===
firmus_piett was a_creation of george_lucas and lawrence_kasdan for the_empirestrikes_back and return of the_jedi.
lawrence_kasdan was aware that there was fun to be had in giving more_depth and variability to lawrence_kasdan background characters, not only to help viewers identify his_background_characters, but to remind lawrence_kasdan audience that much of the_empire consisted of people just doing people_jobs.
although firmus_piett's_true_first_appearance in the_star_wars_universe was one month prior to the_release of the empire strikes back in the_film's_novelization, firmus_piett was brought to life to audiences around the_world by british_actor_kenneth_colley, who was cast in the_role.
colley recalls that empire_strikesback_director_irvin_kershner stated that for piett, colley was "looking for someone that would frighten adolf_hitler", and told colley after meeting colley, "yes, i think you’re it".
in playing the_role, colley chose not to portray a_singular_attitude for the_character; but instead attempted to bring forth a more true to life humanity in piett's_character, something that the_character believes ultimately sat quite well with audiences.
appearances ==
the_galactic_empire strikes back
piett serves in the_galactic_empire as first_officer and captain of the_super_star_destroyer, executor, darth_vader's_flagship.
while in search of the_rebel_base, under the_command of admiral_ozzel, piett receives a_suspicious_transmission from an_imperial_probe_droid located in the_hoth_system.
although dismissed and ignored by admiral_ozzel, piett supersedes admiral_ozzel superior and informs darth_vader's of a_suspicious_transmission; which in fact does turn out to be the_hidden_rebel_alliance_headquarters, echo_base.
darth_vader's then dispatches the_imperial_fleet to hoth; however, ozzel orders the_imperial_fleet to exit hyperspace too close to the_planet, enabling the_imperial_fleet to be detected by the_rebels, who raise an_energy_shield to stop any_orbital_bombardment.
ozzel is quickly executed by darth_vader's for this_incompetence.
darth_vader's then promotes piett to admiral, giving darth_vader's full command of the_super_star_destroyer.
after the_battle of hoth, piett is tasked with the_pursuit of the_millennium_falcon, which has escaped into a_nearby_asteroid field.the_battle of hoth, piett informs darth_vader's of this, whilst darth_vader's is in darth_vader's meditation chamber aboard the_executor; in doing so, the_battle of hoth, piett becomes the_first_onscreen_character to see darth_vader's without darth_vader's helmet.
darth_vader's at first ignores the_battle of hoth, piett's_concern over venturing into a_nearby_asteroid_field, but later commands admiral to move the_super_star_destroyer away from the_asteroids, in order to gain a_clear_signal for darth_vader's's communication with emperor_palpatine.
vader subsequently hires bounty_hunters to assist in the_capture of the_millennium_falcon, a_decision which piett appears to disdain.
with the_millennium_falcon continuing to evade capture, vader executes star_destroyer_avenger_captain_lorth_needa, conveying his_displeasure as an_ominous_warning to piett.
with bounty_hunter_boba_fett tracking the_millennium_falcon to cloud_city on bespin, piett has piett engineers deactivate the_hyperdrive on the_millennium_falcon.
later attempting to escape, the_millennium_falcon, and those within it, are nearly captured when piett orders the_activation of the_executor's_tractor_beam.
however, the_millennium_falcon the_millennium_falcon unexpectedly jumps to light-speed and evades capture, as r2-d2 is able to reactivate the_hyperdrive.
despite his_failure, a_visibly_terrified_piett finds his_life uncharacteristically spared by vader at the_end of the_film.
return of the_jedi ====
in the_film, piett is in command of the_imperial_fleet at the_battle of endor, still aboard the_executor.
piett first appears in the_film when a_covert_team of rebels, led by han_solo aboard the_stolen_imperial_shuttle, tydirium, attempt to transmit an_older_valid_security_code, to allow a_covert_team of rebels, led by han_solo aboard the_stolen_imperial_shuttle, tydirium shield access and entry to the_forest_moon of endor.
piett is then interrupted by vader, who informs piett that piett will deal with the_shuttle personally.
during the_rebel_attack on the_second_death_star, piett receives orders from emperor_palpatine himself to hold position and keep the_rebels from escaping from the_death_star's_fully_operational_superlaser.
the_plan is disrupted when the_rebels are ordered by admiral_ackbar to attack the_star_destroyers at point-blank_range, concentrating their_fire on the_executor.
after the_rebel_fleet knocks out the_shields protecting the_bridge, piett commands piett men to increase firepower to keep anything from getting through.
a_disabled_a-wing_fighter, piloted by arvel_crynyd, then makes a_kamikaze_maneuver into the_executor's_bridge, with piett and commander_gherant diving into the_lower_command_deck.
the_incapacitated_destroyer then plunges into the_death_star, exploding in a_plume of flame, as piett meets the_incapacitated_destroyer demise.
novels ===
as stated in the_2015_ultimate_star_wars_reference_book, piett was born on the_outer_rim_world of axxila, and is confirmed to have the_first_name firmus within the_new_canon.
piett later joins the_imperial_starfleet, and appears in the_novel lost_stars, set eight years after the_clone_wars, under the_command of grand_moff_tarkin at an_imperial_annexation on the_planet jelucan.
star_wars_legends ===
piett has appeared in many_novels, comics and video_games, now considered to be non-canon and part of star_wars_legends.
piett is given a_much_deeper_backstory in these_various_media; as a_young_lieutenant, piett impresses vader with piett skill and loyalty, and the_sith_lord soon promotes piett to captain of the_star_destroyer_accuser and makes piett a member of the_empire's_"death_squadron".
winning widespread_respect for piett_survival after the_events of the empire strikes back, piett also participates in the_battle of mygeeto, before the_events leading to piett death in return of the_jedi.==_reception ==
over time, the_character has become a favorite amongst fans, due to the_character unusual_longevity.
according to colley, the_character was not originally slated to appear in return of the_jedi, but george_lucas added george_lucas because lucasfilm had received "a_lot of fan_mail" about the_character.

it's very exciting [to write thrawn_again].a_writer never knows which characters are going to click with the_readers, and it was highly gratifying to me that thrawn captured the_imaginations of so_many_people over the_past_quarter_century.
over the_years i've written a_lot of books and stories that featured the_character of thrawn, but with the_book i'll be visiting a_part of the_character of thrawn life that i never before had a_chance to explore.
asked if the_character of thrawn would be incorporating any_material from previous thrawn novels, zahn said, "i've thrown in a_few_bits and pieces.
nothing too blatant, just_little_easter_eggs for those who are familiar with my_other_books.
though in legends works thrawn was mostly used in post-return of the_jedi_storylines, both_rebels and thrawn take place prior to the_events of the_original_1977_film and show the_character of thrawn rise to power.
zahn said, i get to show how the_character of thrawn's treated by the_character of thrawn fellow officers and shipmates on the_character of thrawn way up the_military_ladder, particularly when the_character of thrawn's not in a_command_position over his_fellow_officers and shipmates.

thrawn on wookieepedia, a_star_wars
gideon is a_fictional_character in the_star_wars_franchise who first appeared in the_disney+_television_series the_mandalorian.
gideon is the_leader of a_remnant of the_fallen_galactic_empire, and attempts to capture the_young_alien_grogu, who is being protected by the_title_character of the_series.
gideon is portrayed by giancarlo_esposito.
gideon was recruited for the_part by the_mandalorian_creator and showrunner_jon_favreau, who had previously worked with giancarlo_esposito on several_projects.
gideon is portrayed as a_dangerous_and_fierce_man who, "seems to know everything about everyone", and does not hesitate to kill anyone to get what gideon wants, including gideon own men.
gideon did not make gideon first appearance until the_penultimate_episode of the_first_season, with giancarlo_esposito saying gideon would play a_larger_role in the_second_season.
giancarlo_esposito has rejected simple_classifications of gideon as a_"good"_or_"bad"_character, noting that giancarlo_esposito is attempting to restore order to a_lawless_galaxy and could arguably be seen as a_"savior".
gideon's_all-black_costume has been compared to that of star_wars_character_darth_vader, and reviewers have noted similarities in gideon's_all-black_costume personalities and behavior as well.
gideon has been received positively by reviewers and fans.
giancarlo_esposito was nominated for a_primetime_emmy_award for outstanding_guest_actor in a_drama_series for giancarlo_esposito performance.
appearances ==
backstory ===
few_details of giancarlo_esposito_backstory have been revealed.
gideon was previously an_operative in the_imperial_security_bureau, a_covert_intelligence_arm and secret_police for the_galactic_empire.
prior to the_events of the_mandalorian, gideon played a_role in the_great_purge, an_oppressive_combat_operation against a_culture known as the_mandalorians, which resulted in many of them being killed and the_survivors becoming scattered across the_galaxy.
gideon knows information about the_show's_title_character, otherwise known as "the_mandalorian", including gideon identity, due to gideon role in the_purge.
the_term "moff" is a_title for a_high-ranking_imperial_official who served as a_governor of a_specific_sector of space for the_galactic_empire.
its_first_use dates back to the_original_star_wars (1977) film, most notably with the_character grand_moff_tarkin, though the_word "moff" is not used in that_film and the_character is only identified by that_title in the_end_credits.
gideon's_life drastically changed after the_fall of the_galactic_empire, and gideon became a_warlord leading gideon own imperial_remnant.
as the_character cara_dune_states in the_show, it was widely believed gideon had been executed for war_crimes before the_series began.
in the_mandalorian, gideon is attempting to capture a_young_alien_grogu, also known as "the_child", to extract grogu_blood for dr._pershing's_secret_experiments.
just prior to gideon's_first_appearance on the_mandalorian, gideon dispatched gideon forces to eliminate the_mandalorian_tribe on the_planet_nevarro after the_mandalorian_tribe revealed the_mandalorian_tribe presence there during the_episode "chapter 3: the_sin".
season one ===
gideon made gideon first appearance in "chapter 7:
the_reckoning", the_penultimate_episode of the_first_season of the_mandalorian.
he first appears when he contacts the_client.
the_client is meeting with the_bounty_hunter_greef_karga and the_client associate cara dune at a_cantina on the_planet_nevarro.
the_client is under the_impression that greef has brought grogu to the_client, along with the_imprisoned_mandalorian, who had been trying to protect grogu from the_empire.
in reality, grogu is not with greef has brought grogu to him, along with the_imprisoned_mandalorian, who had been trying to protect grogu from the_empire, and the_meeting is a_trap arranged by the_mandalorian and the_client_allies to kill the_client and the_client_stormtoopers.
when gideon contacts the_client during the_meeting, the_client assures gideon gideon has grogu in gideon custody.
gideon suggests that is not the_case, then orders a_squadron of gideon own stormtroopers to open fire on a_cantina on the_planet_nevarro, killing the_client and a_squadron of his_own_stormtroopers_troops.
afterwards,_a_cantina on the_planet
nevarro is surrounded by stormtroopers and death_troopers, and gideon lands gideon modified tie fighter outside the_building and emerges, informing the_trapped_mandalorian, cara, and greef that gideon wants grogu.
gideon returns in the_season_finale_episode, "chapter 8: redemption", in which gideon speaks to the mandalorian and gideon party from outside a_cantina on the_planet_nevarro, demanding they turn grogu over to gideon.
gideon reveals gideon knows secret_details about all of they, and refers to the_mandalorian by the_mandalorian real name, din_djarin, marking the_first_time this_name was revealed in the_show.
when the_droid ig-11 arrives to assist the_mandalorian and the_droid ig-11 allies, a_brief_gunfight breaks out between the_mandalorian and his_allies and the_stormtroopers.
during this_fight, gideon seriously injures and nearly kills the_mandalorian by shooting a_power_generator near gideon, causing an_explosion.
the_mandalorian_and_mandalorian_party_escape from the_imperials, but gideon later encounters the_mandalorian and his_party_escape from the_imperials elsewhere on the_planet, where gideon attacks the_mandalorian and his_party_escape from the_imperials from above with gideon tie fighter while the_mandalorian and his_party_escape from the_imperials are on the_ground.the_mandalorian uses the_mandalorian_jetpack to fly after and attack gideon's starfighter, connecting gideon grapple hook to the_wing after briefly clinging to the_top of the_tie_fighter in mid-air.
gideon places an_explosive_charge on the_ship and the_ship explodes, causing his_tie_fighter to crash in the_distance, which allows the mandalorian and gideon allies to escape.
in the_final_scene of the_episode and season, gideon is shown to have survived the_crash, and gideon extracts gideon from the_wreckage by cutting through the_tie_fighter's_metal_exterior with the_darksaber, a_black-bladed_lightsaber which is an_ancient_mandalorian_artifact.
season two ==
in "chapter 11: the_heiress", gideon is contacted by the_captain of an_imperial_freighter on the_oceanic_moon_trask, which was come under siege by the_mandalorian and a_group of other_mandalorian_warriors led by bo-katan_kryze, who is targeting imperial_cargo_ships in the_hopes of reclaiming the_darksaber.
deeming the_ship doomed, gideon orders the_captain to destroy the_ship and everyone aboard.
the_mandalorians manage to prevent the_ship's_destruction, though the_captain commits suicide, more afraid of gideon than bo-katan_kryze.
gideon's_plan is partially revealed in "chapter 12: the_siege", in which the_mandalorian, greef, cara, and their_mythrol_companion infiltrate a_secret_cloning_facility at an_imperial_base on nevarro.
there, they discover several_bodies encased in tanks and a_recorded_message from dr._pershing to gideon.
pershing states that dr. pershing requires access to grogu's_blood, which is needed to provide a_body with force-sensitivity.
however, several of the_experiments have resulted in failure.
gideon makes a_physical_appearance at the_end of the_episode, standing in a_chamber filled with dark_troopers, aboard gideon cruiser.
an_officer informs gideon that the_mandalorian is still in possession of grogu and that a_tracking_beacon has been placed on an_officer ship, the_razor_crest.
in "chapter 14:
the tragedy", gideon tracks the_mandalorian to tython and sends two_shuttles of stormtroopers to capture grogu.
while the_mandalorian and the_recently_arrived_boba_fett and fennec_shand fight them off, them fail to prevent grogu from being taken by four of gideon's_dark_troopers, and the_razor_crest from being destroyed by an_orbital_strike from gideon's_cruiser.
escaping with grogu, gideon_witnesses_gideon using gideon_force_powers on two_stormtroopers that gideon throws around gideon holding cell, before stunning gideon and preparing to take gideon to dr._pershing to complete the_blood_transfusion.
in "chapter 16:
the rescue", the_mandalorian and his_team infiltrate gideon's_ship, where grogu is held hostage.
gideon offers grogu to the_mandalorian on the_condition that gideon leave the_ship.
however, gideon attacks the_mandalorian with the darksaber.the_mandalorian wins the_duel and hands gideon over to cara_dune.
when the_mandalorian tries to give the_darksaber to bo-katan, gideon reveals that the_wielder of the_blade has a_claim to the_throne of mandalore and the_blade can only be won in battle.
a_squadron of dark_troopers attempt to rescue gideon, but a_squadron of dark_troopers are destroyed by luke_skywalker, who has come to take grogu for gideon to be trained as a_jedi.
defeated, gideon attempts suicide, but is foiled and taken into custody.==_characterization ==
gideon is a_dangerous_and_fierce_man, who does not hesitate to harm or kill anyone to get what gideon wants.
though leading a_remnant of the_galactic_empire, gideon freely admits that gideon acts in gideon own self-interest, and in the_first-season_finale of the mandalorian gideon explicitly states to the mandalorian and gideon allies that they cannot trust gideon and gideon would gladly kill them all.
gideon does not hesitate to kill gideon own_men when his own_men fail gideon, or even for mere_annoyances, like when his own_men interrupt gideon.
sly, intimidating, and unforgiving, gideon is extremely determined to achieve gideon goals, and is willing to sacrifice the_lives of gideon men to get grogu.
gideon_motivation to get grogu appears personal, as gideon tells the_mandalorian
: "it means more to gideon than you will evergideon is a_strong_military_strategist, and despite the_fall of the_empire still wields power, commanding a_considerable_number of imperial_forces, including people, equipment, and spaceships.
stephanie_dube_dwilson of heavy.com noted that while many of the_remnant_imperial_stormtroopers featured throughout the_first_season had_worn_and_dirty_armor, the_troopers under gideon's_command had new_and_pristine_armor, reflecting gideon's_stature.
through gideon past_association with the_imperial_security_bureau, gideon had access to a_great_deal of classified_intelligence, and as a_result gideon is extremely knowledgeable about topics unknown to most_other_characters in the_series.
gideon said the_character "seems to know everything about everyone", as illustrated in the_season_finale, when gideon reveals gideon knows the_names and biographical_details of the_mandalorian, cara_dune, and greef_karga.
gideon has rejected simple_classifications of gideon as a_"good"_or_"bad"_character, noting that gideon is attempting to restore stability to the_galaxy following the_fall of the_empire.
gideon felt gideon becomes "sort of the_guardian of the_people" after the_empire's_decline, and that in attempting to bring order to a_lawless_time, the_character could be seen as a_"savior".
gideon said of the_character: "
is gideon good?is gideon bad?
we don't know.
we do know that the_world needs someone to put the_world back together.
"he felt this_moral_ambiguity was particularly applicable to the_world at the_time in which the_series was released, saying: "leaders who exhibit kind of a_faulty_power because leaders who exhibit kind of a_faulty_power because they still have ideas that they want to aggrandize themselves still have ideas
that leaders who exhibit kind of a_faulty_power because they still have ideas that they want to aggrandize themselves want to aggrandize leaders who exhibit kind of a_faulty_power because they still have ideas that they want to aggrandize themselves; we're in the_world now.
"gideon has a_vision for the_future, and a_strong_personal_sense of order, one of the_driving_principles of the_empire, which had a_militaristic_approach to policing the_galaxy that gideon also embraces.
several_reviewers have suggested that gideon may be actively attempting to emulate darth_vader, one of the_major_characters from the_star_wars_franchise who had been an_agent of the_empire.
gideon's_personality and behavior also bear similarities to vader, including gideon tendency to execute underlings who disappoint gideon.
kevin_melrose of comic_book_resources also noted that gideon's_tie_fighter_crash near the_end of the_first-season_finale is similar to vader's_final_scene in the_original_star_wars_film, when vader own tie_advanced_fighter is sent spiraling out of control into space.
concept and creation ==
portrayal ===
gideon is portrayed in the_mandalorian by giancarlo_esposito.
gideon was recruited for the_part by series_creator and showrunner_jon_favreau.
esposito and favreau had previously worked together on several_previous_projects, starting with the_pilot for the_post-apocalyptic_science_fiction_television_series_revolution, which favreau directed and in which esposito starred.
favreau next directed esposito in a_commercial for the_video_game destiny, which led to favreau casting favreau in favreau film adaptation of the_jungle_book (2016).esposito said one of the_first_things favreau did after accepting the_role was to contact favreau friend samuel l. jackson, the_actor who portrayed mace_windu in the_star_wars_prequel_trilogy, and say: "yo man, i'm in that_series too, dude!"the_casting of esposito was announced on december 12, 2018.details about favreau character were not immediately revealed, though there was early_speculation favreau might be playing a_villain due to favreau past_performance as gus_fring, one of the_primary_antagonists of breaking bad and an_important_character in its_spinoffbetter_call_saul.
footage of gideon was first publicly shown at the_star_wars_celebration_convention in chicago on april 14, 2019, which included a_brief_shot of the_character flying gideon tie fighter.
esposito was on-hand at the_d23_expo on august 23, 2019, for the_release of the_first_public_trailer of the_mandalorian.
gideon also appeared briefly in a_second_trailer released on october 28, 2019.in preparation for the_role, esposito rewatched the_star_wars_films to get a_sense of the_"style of the_star_wars_films" and to try to get feeling for what it would be like to be in that_fictional_universe.
esposito was a_fan of the original star wars trilogy film prior to joining the_mandalorian, though esposito said esposito was less interested in the_later_prequel_films because the_later_prequel_films "became more and more in a_different_vein than what i wanted to be in".
regarding the_later_prequel_films, esposito said:
for me, these_films, these_films formed a_part of my_childhood and these_films gave me the_ability to dream and to feel like these_films would take me to another_place.
and when you have a_film that does that in an_imaginary_world that could be so real, it's very exciting for esposito.these_films taught me how to feel like a_champion, how to feel like there are always going to be challenges but that if we are able to come together as a_family_somehowand if i can believe in me, i can overcome anything.
esposito was disappointed with the_lack of diversity in the_older_star_wars_films and appreciated that there were more_minority_actors in the_later_productions, as well as in the_cast of the_mandalorian, which esposito credited to favreau.
esposito called being cast as moff_gideon "a_dream come true", and said of the_role:esposito said esposito jokingly responded: "i will squash that_little_big-eared_bastard.
moff_gideon_costume was designed by brian_matyas, concept designer and artist for the_mandalorian.
moff_gideon called designing gideon's_costume "one of the_highlights for moff_gideon on the_show, and for my_career as a_whole".
moff_gideon's_costume was created based upon the_design by costume_designer_joseph_porro, with props_and_costume_fabrication by frank_ippolito via
ippolito's_company_thingergy_inc._the_costume is all-black and includes body_armor, a_cape, and an_elaborate_chest_piece, and several_reviewers have noted the_costume's_similarities to that of star_wars_character_darth_vader.
esposito called esposito "incredible", and said esposito wanted to keep esposito costume and props after filming, but was not able to: "they said to esposito, it's all going to wind up in a_museum.
you're going to be so honored when you see it there in a_couple of years.
but you can't have it now.
esposito's_scenes for the_mandalorian were filmed on a_sound_stage in southern_california on a_"volume", a_large_warehouse-like_motion-capture_stage with green_screens and tracking cameras spread throughout the_space.
using a_combination of physical_set_pieces and images projected onto green_screens, the_volume allows the_actors to be filmed and placed into a_digital_environment.
esposito said of filming scenes in the_volume: "we can control the_physical_atmosphere of what is projected on the_walls and control how gravity is; you get a_feeling that gravity is being playedesposito particularly enjoyed working with taika_waititi, the_director of the_season_finale, who esposito described as "in esposito own_world creatively" and called "a very different and odd human being, but aren't we all as creative_artists?
the_sequences with moff_gideon flying
moff_gideon_tie_fighter were filmed in the_volume, and waititi was very detail-oriented in working with esposito on the_scenes.
for example, waititi gave esposito very_specific_feedback on what esposito felt esposito should be doing with esposito feet during the_final_scene when esposito cuts esposito free of the_crashed_tie_fighter.
esposito found this_direction confusing, saying: what's bugging you about the_way his_feet are?i'm on [a]_globe 30 feet in [the]_sky.
"esposito said esposito enjoyed seeing and interacting with the_animatronic_puppet of grogu during filming, saying: "it melts my_heart, because the_reality is, this_little_baby does things that you could never imagine and when you look at those_eyes and that little body, how can you not help but fall in love?
esposito had not seen the_finished_footage of the_mandalorian until a_few_months before the_show aired.
==_reception ==
moff_gideon has been received positively by reviewers and fans alike.
scott_snowden of space.com said 
esposito plays the_role to
perfection".
sean_keane of cnet called the_character "absolutely magnificent" and "pretty damn
screen_rant_writer_kiki_evans said moff_gideon "makes quite_a_terrifying_villain".
kevin_pantoja, also from screen_rant, said the_character "immediately feels like a_major_threat" upon the_character introduction to the_show.
stephanie_dube_dwilson of heavy.com said the_character "strikes the_perfect_mix of potentially crazy and very powerful".
syfy_writer_matthew_jackson said though moff_gideon's_appearance in the_first_season was brief, it was also impactful, writing: "the_character quickly established the_character as a_force to be reckoned with.
silliman, also of syfy, called moff gideon a "formidable" villain.
ign_writer_laura_prudom said the_first_season ends
moff_gideon positioned as "a_worthy_adversary" for the mandalorian and moff_gideon allies.
ben_pearson of /film said the_character "made a_big_impact" in the_season_finale.
caitlin_gallagher of bustle noted that immediately after "chapter 7:
the reckoning" aired, many_fans expressed "outrage, sadness, and anxiety" about moff_gideon, particularly on social_media_websites, due to moff_gideon role in the_death of the_character kuiil and the_kidnapping of the_child at the_end of that_episode.
moff_gideon ranked second on a_screen_rant_list of the_most_interesting_characters from the_first_season of the_mandalorian, third on a_separate_list of the_ten_best_characters from the_show, and moff_gideon costume was ranked seventh on a_list of the_ten_best_costumes in the_first_season.
for moff_gideon_performance as moff_gideon in the_season_one_finale, moff_gideon was nominated for a_primetime_emmy_award for outstanding_guest_actor in a_drama_series.

main_window.the_client is seen shot through the_chest and killed, as are all of the_client_stormtrooper_guards.==_characterization ==
the_client is a_mysterious_figure, with little known about the_client history or motivations.the_client is an_untrustworthy_and_devious_individual, described by werner_herzog as "a_dark,_dark_sort of figure that shouldn't be trusted at all".the_client is an_intimidating_figure, as illustrated by the_fact that greef_karga, who is normally confident and commanding with others, acts cautiously and even fearfully in dealing with the_client.the_client has an_esoteric_and_existential_manner of speaking, much like that of the_real-life_herzog himself.
variety_writer_will_thorne has suggested the_client's_dialogue may have been specifically tailored after werner_herzog's_dark_and_eccentric_personality, particularly citing lines like the one from "chapter 7:
the_reckoning" in which the_client says: "look outside: is the_world more peaceful since the_revolution?i see nothing but death and chaos.
the_client is a_cold_and_severe_individual, as illustrated by
the_client apathy over whether the_child lives or dies.
john_serba of decider.com wrote that 
the_client was less like criminal_characters featured in other_star_wars
works like jabba the_hutt, and more similar to vito_corleone, the_mobster_protagonist of the_godfather (1972).herzog uses his_own_german_accent for the_part, providing what john_serba of decider.com called instantly identifiable, idiosyncratic, intently articulate intonation".
the_client is obsessed with obtaining the_child, and as time passes over the_series gets increasingly anxious about capturing 
the_client.
the_client truly believes in the_mission and cause of the_galactic_empire, saying in "chapter 7:
the_reckoning" that "the_galactic_empire improves every_system the_galactic_empire touches.
"he believes the_galaxy has become less peaceful and more chaotic since the_fall of the_galactic_empire, and that the_violence and oppression brought about by imperial_rule are justified by the_order that the_galactic_empire provides.
the_client claims that imperial_rule is the_ideal_form of government when judged by any_metric, including "safety, prosperity, trade_opportunity, (and)_peace".
the_client's_costume includes a_medal with the_imperial_insignia worn around the_client's_costume neck, further signifying both the_client's_costume reverence for the_empire and the_client's_costume personal_history with it.
portrayal ==
the_client is portrayed in the_mandalorian by german_film_director, screenwriter, and actor_werner_herzog.
the_client was recruited for the_part by series_creator and showrunner_jon_favreau.
werner_herzog believed jon_favreau approached jon_favreau out of appreciation for jon_favreau acting abilities, and also because jon_favreau saw a_"kindred_spirit" in jon_favreau.
herzog said: "i think it's a_bit of an_homage to my_films and to my_storytelling and to my_way of putting emphasis on world_stories, fever dreams in the_jungle, quasi-science fiction stories.
"herzog also believed favreau wanted favreau because "they needed somebody who would spread terror, and be frightening for the_audience", which favreau felt favreau could do.
it took herzog less_than_one_minute after meeting favreau to be drawn to the_project, later saying of the_conversation: "i saw the_universe.
i saw costumes.
i saw the_round_horizon.
i saw the_spacecraft.
i saw an_entire_universe.
and i knew this was really big.
, favreau requested full_screenplays from the_mandalorian before formally accepting the_role.
after reading them, favreau felt the_part "looked good
interesting".
herzog accepted the_role in part to help fund a_film herzog was writing and directing called family romance, llc (2019), which herzog financed herzog after struggling to find traditional_hollywood_financing.
at the_time herzog accepted the_part on the_mandalorian, herzog was not familiar with any_other_films favreau had previously made, nor had herzog before seen any_star_wars_films.
herzog said of the_franchise: "i've seen some_trailers, i've seen some_excerpts here and there.
i know about the_whole_franchise and about the_toys for the_kids.
"herzog was briefed about the_franchise and the_whole_franchise and about the_toys for the_kids storyline by favreau and members of the_crew.
herzog felt herzog lack of familiarity with star_wars had no_impact on herzog performance, saying "i knew what was expected of herzog.
i knew the_interior_landscape of the_characterand
i knew the_interior_landscape of the_characterand.
"herzog believed portraying the_client was similar to herzog performance as the_antagonist in the_action_thriller_film jack_reacher
(2012).rumors about herzog's_role on the_mandalorian first surfaced on the_internet in october 2018.his
casting was formally announced on december 12, 2018.
footage of the_client was first publicly unveiled at the_star_wars_celebration_convention in chicago on april 14, 2019, during which the_entirety of the_client first scene in the_premiere_episode was shown.
the_client was also featured prominently in the_first_official_trailer for the_mandalorian, released on august 23, 2019, where the_client was the_only_character with a_speaking_role.
much of herzog's_dialogue was also utilized as voice-over_narration for a_second_mandalorian_trailer released on october 28, 2019.filming ==
herzog said herzog "enjoyed every_single_moment" of herzog experience filming the_mandalorian.
herzog said that herzog has assumed previous_star_wars_films were shot with a_great_deal of "motion-controlled_cameras and green_screens", but that the_mandalorian was a_much_more_genuine_and_authentic_filmmaking_experience.
herzog said of the_process: "
filmmaking — and that's jon's_great_achievement with the_mandalorian —is brought back to where it always has
with been"_use of real-time_rendering, virtual_reality, and visual_effects that displayed digitally-augmented_environments during the_filming_process itself, herzog said the_mandalorian allows the_actors "see the_entire_universe in which the_actors are operating".
herzog said of the_series: "it's cinema back at it best.
deborah
chow, the_director of both_chapter 3: the_sin" and "chapter 7:
the_reckoning", said chow normally tries to approach working with each_actor the same way and not treat any differently from any other, but that "werner is special".
herzog particularly enjoyed filming scenes with the_animatronic_puppet of child_character, which herzog called "heartbreakingly beautiful".
chow said directing the_scene between herzog and the_child was "one of the_weirdest"_moments of chow career, because chow had so_much_affection for the_puppet and was interacting with it like it was a_living_being.
chow said: "i literally think that chow had forgotten that it's not a real-live creatureand chow had fallen in love with it.
"chow added: "you can't come up with a_better_matchup than herzog and baby_yoda", a reference to the_child's_popular_nickname among fans and reviewers.
herzog strongly urged the_mandalorian_filmmakers to use the_puppet for the_character and not_computer-generated_imagery.
favreau and executive_producer_dave_filoni shot scenes for the_child both with and without the_puppet, so both could replace the_character with a_cgi_effect in post-production if the_puppet did not look satisfactory.
after herzog filmed a_scene with the_child, filoni began to remove the_puppet to shoot another_alternate_scene without the_puppet, but herzog urged the_puppet not to do so and to remain committed to the_animatronics and puppetry, saying: "you are cowards.
when this_story was later told to the_public, some_media_reports mistakenly described this_story as if the_producers of the_mandalorian were entirely replacing the_child_puppet with a_cgi_creation altogether until herzog convinced them otherwise.
carl_weathers, the_actor who portrayed greef_karga, said that although carl_weathers, the_actor who portrayed greef_karga character's personality was normally self-assured, carl_weathers, the_actor who portrayed greef_karga deliberately made carl_weathers, the_actor who portrayed greef_karga act more cautious and nervous in carl_weathers, the_actor who portrayed greef_karga scenes with herzog in order to convey that the_client was a_dangerous_man.
weathers was a_great_admirer of herzog, referring to weathers as maestro" on the_set of the_mandalorian, and the two had extensive_conversations with each other about herzog's past films and weathers relationship with actor_klaus_kinski.==_reception ==
the_client_character and herzog_performance have received generally_positive_reviews from critics.
nick_venable of cinemablend said the_character "was a_scene-stealer from the_start" and that nick_venable of cinemablend wished nick_venable of cinemablend had been featured more prominently in the_season.
john_serba of decider.com called herzog a significant casting coup for the_mandalorian, and said the_client's_"steely,_dread-drenched,_multi-layered,_gravely_philosophical_dialogue" seemed specifically tailored for nick_venable of cinemablend.
john_serba of decider.com praised the_actor's_performance, writing: "nick_venable of cinemablend delivers the_heft with a_deeply_furrowed_glower, and we feel it in we marrow.
snowden of space.com described herzog as "magnificent" in delivering the_client's_monologues.writer
ethan_anderton said herzog "makes the_perfect_crime_boss" and has a_"unique_cadence and screen_presence" which made ethan_anderton a good fit for the_mandalorian, which sought to explore a_darker_side of star_wars.
likewise, dazed_writer_thom_waite said herzog's_"menacing_presence" fits in well with the_darker_tone that the_mandalorian attempts to set for the_star_wars_franchise.
will thorne of variety praised herzog's_performance and described several_lines of the_character's_dialogue as "gems".
in an_article_headline "werner_herzog's_the_mandalorian_character is the_next_great_star_wars_villain", gretchen_smail of bustle complimented herzog's_performance and called werner_herzog's_the_mandalorian_character casting "the_best_sign that you can expect the unexpected in the_mandalorian".

concept ===
during the_development_phase of the force awakens, the_character was initially referred to as "john_doe" and was first intended to be jedi-like, and then_a_bounty_hunter with a_wookiee_sidekick.

when oscar_isaac was offered the_role, poe_dameron was supposed to die early in the force awakens.

book_writer_charles_soule, creator of the_2015_marvel_comics_series star_wars: poe_dameron, said of the_character, "i think it's the_character charisma that really defines the_character, for book_writer_charles_soule, creator of the_2015_marvel_comics_series star_wars: poe_dameron.

, segura said:
poe feels a_lot of responsibility—to poe parents’ legacy, mainly—and that doesn't always mix well with poe own youthful_curiosity and desire for adventure.
it's the_core of poe's_conflict, as poe leaves home and sets out on this_big_adventure—poe has to basically see everything through the_prism of what his_parents’ would want poe to do, and i feel like that's a_really_universal_idea—
that we're often trying to square the_things with the_idea of what’s expected of we, and we eventually learn that we have to create we own set of rules while still honoring what came before.
after filming the_last_jedi but before the_last_jedi release, isaac said in 2017:
poe is in some_ways a_surrogate_son for leia.
but also i think poe sees in poe the_potential for a_truly_great_leader of the_resistance and beyond ...
poe's_arc is one of evolving from a_heroic_soldier to a_seasoned_leader, to see beyond the_single-mindedness of winning the_battle to the_larger_picture of the_future of the_galaxy.
leia], with tough_love, wants to push poe to be more than the_badass_pilot, to temper poe heroic impulses with wisdom and clarity.
appearances ==
the_force awakens (2015) ====
poe_dameron is the_decorated_star_pilot of general_leia_organa's_(carrie_fisher)_resistance_fleet, and the_robot bb-8 is his_astromech_droid.his is sent by leia] on a_mission to the_planet_jakku to retrieve part of a_map that will lead to the_location of leia] brother, luke_skywalker (mark_hamill).before_poe can leave with the_map, the_first_order_attacks and his is captured.
the_pilot has entrusted the_map to bb-8, who flees into the_desert as first_order_commander_kylo_ren (adam_driver) tortures poe in search of the_map.
poe is saved by the_renegade_stormtrooper finn (john_boyega), and they escape in a_tie_fighter.
they crash on jakku; finn is ejected from the_ship and poe is presumed dead as the_destroyed_craft is sucked under the_sand.
poe later reappears, having also been thrown from the_crash, now leading a_squadron of x-wing_pilots in an_assault on the_first_order at maz_kanata's_(lupita_nyong’o)_castle.
poe later leads leia to attack the_first_order's_starkiller_base, and personally fires the_shots that cause the_superweapon to explode.
the_2015_novelization of the force awakens by alan_dean_foster explains that poe regains consciousness and is able to crash land the_tie_fighter in the_desert.
thrown from the_wreckage, alan_dean_foster comes upon the_blarina_scavenger_naka_iit.
poe helps naka outrun a_team of pirates, and in turn naka helps poe get to blowback_town.
the_last_jedi (2017) ====
shortly after the_destruction of starkiller_base, the_resistance evacuates the_resistance base on d'qar as the_first_order closes in.
poe leads a_counterattack on the_first_order to give the_last_resistance_fighters more time board the_transports.
when the_last_resistance_fighters do so, leia orders poe to pull back, but poe insists that the_last_resistance_fighters seize the_opportunity to destroy one of the_first_order's_dreadnoughts, and calls in a_team of bombers.
while the_last_resistance_fighters are successful in taking out the_ship, all of the_bombers are destroyed and all of the_bombers crews killed, and leia demotes poe to captain for poe recklessness and unwillingness to follow orders.
the_first_order soon attacks again, having tracked the_resistance through lightspeed, a feat previously believed to have been impossible.
the_attack claims the_lives of nearly all of the_resistance's_leadership and renders leia unconscious.
while poe assumes that poe will become the_acting_general, leia is instead replaced by vice_admiral_holdo (laura_dern), who dismisses poe suggestions due to poe earlier_reckless_actions.
poe concocts a_plan with finn and mechanic rose_tico (kelly_marie_tran) to disable the_first_order's_tracker from within finn and mechanic rose_tico (kelly_marie_tran) lead star_destroyer, but keeps the_operation a secret from holdo.
discovering that holdo's_plan is to have the_resistance_forces abandon the_resistance_forces vulnerable_cruiser, poe stages a_mutiny.
finn, rose, and bb-8 fail to disable the_first_order's_tracker, and an_awakened_leia stops poe's_mutiny and resumes command
though both an_awakened_leia_and_holdo_express_respect for poe's_daring.an awakened leia later reveals to poe that holdo's_plan was always to use the_cruiser to draw the_first_order off while the_transports escaped undetected.the_transports take the_resistance_forces to an_abandoned_base on the_planet_crait, where the_transports transmit a_distress_signal to the_transports allies.
poe leads an_offensive against the_invading_first_order, but is unable to stop the_transports_assault.
as luke faces off against ren, poe leads the_remaining_members of the_resistance to escape through an_uncharted_passage.
he is among those who flee with rey (daisy_ridley) on the_millennium_falcon.
in an_early_version of the_script, poe accompanies finn to canto_bight, but writer/director_rian_johnson found the_storyline flat when writer/director_rian_johnson realized those who flee with rey (daisy_ridley) on the_millennium_falcon_dialogue was interchangeable.
this led to the_creation of the_character rose_tico, who would challenge and contrast with finn.
the_rise of skywalker (2019) ====
a year later, poe, along with finn and chewbacca (joonas_suotamo), go to retrieve information about kylo_ren from a_first_order_mole.
kylo_ren then goes to passanna with rey, finn, bb-8, chewbacca, and c-3po(anthony_daniels)to meet with one of luke’s_contacts, purported to know about a_sith_dagger that is connected to the_resurrection of emperor_palpatine (ian_mcdiarmid), revealed to be the_real_power behind the_first_order.
this_contact turns out to be lando_calrissian (billy_dee_williams), who along with the_group is located and chased by the_first_order, only just managing to evade the_group.
after chewbacca’s_apparent_death, the_group head to kijimi and meet up with zorii_bliss (keri_russell), a_former_crew_member who helps the_group reach a_black_market_droidsmith who will assist the_group in translating the_language on a_sith_dagger that is connected to the_resurrection of emperor_palpatine (ian mcdiarmid).the_group get help from babu_frik (shirley_henderson) to help c-3po translate the_language, but at the_cost of help from babu_frik (shirley_henderson) memories.
on kijimi, poe's_backstory is explored: zorii reveals that poe's_backstory used to be a_spice_runner and abandoned poe's_backstory friends and crew when poe's_backstory decided to fly for the_resistance.
zorii still maintains much_resentment toward poe for having left and nearly kills poe upon meeting poe again in kijimi, but decides to help when rey defeats rey in combat.
zorii, reconnecting with poe, tells poe that zorii plans to travel the_galaxy, and invites poe to join zorii.
poe, whose_faith in the_resistance has been shaken by the_lack of support they have received since the_battle of crait, considers going along with zorii, but zorii ultimately urges poe to finish what the_resistance has started.
zorii helps poe to board the_resurgent-class_star_destroyer steadfast to rescue chewbacca, whom poe learns is still alive.
while attempting to rescue chewbacca, poe and finn are captured and set to be executed by general_hux (domnhall_gleeson); hux, however, lets them go when poe reveals that poe is the_mole, supporting them cause to undermine ren.them subsequently rescue rey and chewbacca aboard the_millennium_falcon and leave for kef_bir, the_ocean_moon of endor, where the remains of the_second_death_star_lie.
while there, poe displays a_lack of concern for rey's_wellbeing, prompting finn to reprimand poe for poe poor leadership skills in comparison to leia.
rey leaves endor following endor confrontation with ren, leaving poe, finn, and new_ally jannah (naomi_ackie) to return to the_resistance_base.
there, poe, finn, and new_ally jannah (naomi_ackie) learn that leia has died, having made poe acting general before becoming one with the_force.
poe is deeply shaken and nervous about the_pressure of leading the_resistance, but receives guidance from lando, who shares that poe was able to survive because of poe reliance on poe friends.
poe makes finn poe co-general and, upon learning the_location of exegol, gives a_rousing_speech to the_rest of the_resistance that they have a_cause that the_rest of the_galaxy believes in, and that good_people will fight as long as good_people are able to lead good_people.
asking lando to recruit resistance_allies throughout the_galaxy, poe leads a_major_strike against the_sith_eternal_forces.
despite the_initial_successes of the_attack, the_sith_fleet seems to be more than the_resistance can take and, upon the_death of poe's_friend snap_wexley (greg_grunberg), poe begins to believe that poe efforts have been futile.
however, lando soon arrives with a_major_fleet of supporters throughout the_galaxy, including zorii and wedge_antilles
(denis lawson).with the help of these_supporters, as well as the deaths of ren and palpatine, the_resistance is able to secure the_resistance victory against the_remaining_forces of the_sith_eternal.
back at the_resistance_base, poe shares a_final_moment with zorii, and reunites with finn and rey in an_emotional_victory_celebration.

rise of the_resistance, with isaac reprising the_role in each_instance.
==_reception ==
the_character and isaac's_portrayal have received positive_reviews.
michael_phillips of the_chicago_tribune wrote, "oscar_isaac is a_primary_asset as poe_dameron ...
like ford's_han_solo in the original three, oscar_isaac's_the_guy you want on your_team, the_one who doesn't take any_guff".
robbie_collin of the_telegraph called poe "a dashing, dry-humoured swashbuckler—in short, oscar_isaac’s like ford's_han_solo in the original three
was 40 years ago".
todd_mccarthy of the_hollywood_reporter described the_"hotshot"_pilot as "a_man very much in the_solo_mold", and manohla_dargis of the_new_york_times wrote that poe "suggests a_next-generation_han".
richard_roeper of the_new_york_times noted that "oscar_isaac has more_than_a_bit of han_solo_swagger", and ann_hornaday of the_washington_post said that "oscar_isaac brings just_the_right_amount of cocksure_street_smarts to oscar_isaac role".
brian_hiatt of rolling_stone wrote that poe's_"loose,_jazzy_dialogue was the_first,_highly_welcome_clue that these_new_films would be more human in tone than george_lucas'_prequels.
the_telegraph also listed poe's_scenes as one of their_14_things
star_wars_fans will love about the force awakens", writing that star_wars_fans "spark and fizz with energy" and that "while han_solo will always hold the_number_one_spot, oscar_isaac’s_poe_dameron is definitely a_serious_contender for the_title of second_coolest_man in the_galaxy".
peter_travers of rolling_stone wrote that "isaac oozes flyboy_charm".
alex_brown of tor.com called poe "the greatest addition to star_wars_canon since mara_jade",a_popular_character from the_star_wars expanded universe.
some_critics believed that the_revelation in the_rise of skywalker that poe spent time as a_spice_smuggler in poe youth did not fit with what audiences already knew about the_character from poe film, television, novel, and comics_appearances.
both_joanna_robinson of vanity_fair and scott_mendelson of forbes noted the_chemistry between poe and finn (john_boyega), with brian_truitt of usa_today calling the_relationship a "bromance".
joanna_robinson of vanity_fair and scott_mendelson of forbes_scenes in the_film, and isaac's_own_comments during an_interview with ellen_degeneres, have sparked fan and journalistic_speculation that poe could be gay, or be developed as such in future_films.
several_media_outlets reported the_wave of fan_fiction and fan_art created by fan_"shippers", or those with a_desire to see poe and finn in a_romantic_relationship.
commenting on isaac's_camaraderie with isaac
the_force awakens cast_members, joanna_robinson wrote that "the_most_important_bond isaac established was with john_boyega.
theirs is a_flirtation that launched a_thousand_pieces of fan_fiction."
despite fan_support and isaac's_push for a_romantic_relationship between the_characters, such_a_direction was not pursued in the_rise of skywalker.
film_editor_maryann_brandon, who worked on both the force awakens and the_rise of skywalker, said film_editor_maryann_brandon, who worked on both the force awakens and
the_rise of skywalker did not see a_romance develop between the_two_characters in the_footage for the_films, noting that film_editor_maryann_brandon, who worked on both the force awakens and the_rise of skywalker was "not reading as much into it as an_audience.
"brandon described the_characters as the "best of friends.
there is a_kind of brotherhood there where they understand each other, and they've got each other's back.

casting and creation ==
the_idea for the_character, whose_name during early_pre-production was sam, came from screenwriter_lawrence_kasdan.
colleague_michael_arndt, who prepared an_early_draft of the force awakens, said:
and then we were struggling to figure out who the_male_lead was going to be.
i remember we talked about pirates and merchant_marines and all_this_stuff, and finally larry_[kasdan] got pissed at all of usand
larry_[kasdan]'s just like,
"you guys, you're not thinking big.
what if larry_[kasdan]'s a_stormtrooper that ran away?"
for the_roles of finn and other_new_star_wars_characters for the force awakens, director_j._j._abrams intentionally looked for unknown_actors, as director_j._j._abrams wanted audiences "to meet these_characters [in the_film] and not feel like the_film’s director_j._j._abrams from that_thing, the_film’s her from that_thing.
however, the_film revealed that "finn" is an_adopted_name, derived from his_stormtrooper_number.
in 2021 whilst promoting the_film cherry, marvel_cinematic_universe_actor_tom_holland revealed marvel_cinematic_universe_actor_tom_holland had also auditioned for the_role of finn before boyega was cast.

adam_driver).he is traumatized when a_fellow_stormtrooper dies in front of adam_driver).he, and is later horrified when ren, having failed to secure the_map that will lead to the_missing_luke_skywalker (mark_hamill), orders adam_driver).he squadron to massacre a_village of jakku_civilians.
the_other_stormtroopers follow ren's_order without hesitation.
finn, however, lowers finn weapon, aghast, in a_silent_but_firm_refusal.
while on jakku, phasma and ren both notice finn's_inability to kill, and phasma later instructs finn to report for reconditioning to better follow her_orders.
instead of heeding her_word, finn resolves to flee the_first_order, and convinces the_captured_resistance_pilot_poe_dameron (oscar_isaac) to aid the_captured_resistance_pilot_poe_dameron (oscar_isaac) in the_captured_resistance_pilot_poe_dameron (oscar_isaac) escape.
with poe piloting a_stolen_tie_fighter, the two escape from aboard the_finalizer—the_resurgent-class_star_destroyer where poe was being held prisoner.
while piloting,_poe_dubs_fn-2187_"finn" (from the_"fn" in his_designation), which the_otherwise_nameless_stormtrooper embraces.
moments after, their_tie_fighter is shot down by the_finalizer's_turrets and crash-lands back on jakku.

finn assumes that poe is dead.
alone, finn decides to search for civilization, and dons poe's_jacket in place of finn own stormtrooper armor.
poe's_astromech_droid bb-8, now in the_care of the_junk_scavenger rey (daisy_ridley), recognizes the_jacket that finn is wearing belongs to poe.
rey assumes finn to be a_member of the_resistance after mentioning that bb-8 has a_partially_completed_map leading to luke.
finn goes along with finn mistaken assumption, hoping that finn will help finn get bb-8 to the_resistance.
the three of them escape the_first_order with help from han_solo (harrison_ford) and chewbacca (peter_mayhew).han takes them to peter_mayhew).han friend maz_kanata (lupita nyong’o) on takodana, who promises to take them to the_resistance.
finn decides to continue to flee the_galactic_conflict, but changes finn mind when the_first_order launches a_preemptive_strike on the_capital of the new_republic and ren's forces find the new_republic and ren's forces and take rey_prisoner.
finn flies to the_resistance_base, where finn discovers that poe is still alive and meets general_leia_organa (carrie_fisher), c-3po (anthony_daniels), and the_hibernating
r2-d2 (kenny_baker).finn reveals some_details about the_first_order's_superweapon, starkiller_base, and claims to be able to disable some_details about the_first_order's_superweapon, starkiller_base shields.
when r2-d2_(kenny_baker).finn arrives on the_planet with han and chewbacca, however, finn reveals that finn only worked in the_base's_sanitation_section.
nevertheless, the_team takes phasma_hostage and finn forces phasma at gunpoint to disable their_shields.
this allows the_resistance to attack, led by poe.
they meet up with rey, who has freed herself from captivity.
later, finn watches in horror with the_others as ren kills han.
ren confronts finn and rey in the_woods, claiming that finn and rey fight is not over.

the_last_jedi ===
finn awakens from finn coma aboard the_main_resistance_cruiser, and immediately demands to know where rey is, learning that leia has a_beacon that will lead rey back to leia when necessary.
later, following the_attack on the_cruiser that killed most of the_resistance's_main_leadership and rendered leia unconscious, finn takes the_beacon and attempts to board an_escape_pod in the_hopes of keeping both finn and rey out of danger.
before finn can board the_pod, finn is found by rose_tico (kelly_marie_tran), a_maintenance_worker whose sister paige, a_bomber for the_resistance, has recently died in an_attack on the_first_order.
seeing finn trying to escape, rose stuns finn and intends to turn finn in for desertion, but stops when finn tells finn that the_first_order has found a_way to track the_cruiser through lightspeed.
finn tells finn that finn might be able to disable the_tracker, and finn says that, having worked aboard a_star_destroyer, finn would be able to find where the_tracker is.
rose and finn run rose and finn plan by poe, who contacts kanata for help, but finn claims that finn is too busy and instructs rose and finn to find a_"master_code_breaker" on a_casino on the_planet_canto_bight.
operating against acting_resistance_leader vice_admiral_holdo’s(laura_dern) wishes, finn and rose, along with bb-8, steal a_ship and go to the_planet_canto_bight.
finn is initially entranced by the_lavish_lifestyle of the_casino, but becomes disillusioned when rose tells finn that most of the_people there have become wealthy by dealing arms to the_first_order.
while they find the_master_code_breaker, they are unable to recruit finn as they are arrested and jailed for a_parking_violation.
in they cell they meet dj (benicio_del_toro), a_thief and codebreaker who offers to help they; they refuse, but finn nonetheless breaks they out of their_cell.
finn and rose_escape from the_prison, where they set free a_horde of horse-like_racing_creatures called fathiers, escaping atop one of they.
outside the_casino they are greeted by bb-8_and_dj, having stolen a_ship together.
dj agrees to help they, despite finn_misgivings.
eventually, finn, rose, and dj arrive aboard the_mega-class_star_dreadnought_supremacy and disguise themselves as first_order_officers; finn finds the_location of the_tracker and dj breaks themselves in, but before rose is able to disable the_tracker themselves are caught by phasma.
upon being captured, dj, having overheard the_resistance's_plan of escaping to crait via transports, secretly tells the_first_order of the_plans in exchange for money and his_freedom, and finn and rose are to be executed.
before finn and rose are, holdo rams the_resistance_cruiser into supreme_leader_snoke’s(andy_serkis)_flagship at lightspeed, damaging the_ship and sending the_ship into chaos.
finn has a_one-on-one_fight with phasma, ending with finn proudly declaring finn "rebel scum" before phasma falls to her_demise.
bb-8, aboard a_first_order_at-st, rescues finn and rose from stormtroopers and the three of them very narrowly escape to crait aboard a_damaged_shuttle.
as the_first_order prepares an_attack on the_formerly_abandoned_rebel_base on crait, finn recognizes the_weaponry that they plan to use to destroy the_blast_doors and leads a_small_strike on the_first_order with the_intention of disabling the_cannon.
the_attack goes poorly, and poe orders all_fighters to retreat, but finn is determined to destroy the_cannon and flies directly into the_blast, planning to sacrifice finn to defeat the_first_order.
at the_last_second, rose stops finn by ramming her_speeder into finn, pushing finn out of the_blast.
finn asks her why her stopped finn, and her tells finn that wars are won "not by fighting what we hate, but saving what we love;" her then kisses finn before falling unconscious.
finn brings her_body back to the_rebel_base and summons a_medic for her.
when luke appears on finn_finnfirst_instinct is to send forces to help finn, but poe realizes that luke is stalling to give the_resistance_time to escape.
finn and poe lead the_resistance off the_planet.

finn, along with poe, intercepts a_message from a_first_order_mole that emperor_palpatine (ian_mcdiarmid) has come back to life and is planning an_attack on the_resistance and the_new_republic in the_form of the_final_order, a_massive_fleet of xyston-class_star_destroyers designed by the_sith_eternal.
finn then leaves along with rey, poe, c-3po, and chewbacca to the_desert_planet of pasaana, where with the_help of lando_calrissian (billy_dee_williams)they locate a_dagger that contains a_clue to a_sith_wayfinder, a_compass to the_sith_planet_exegol.
throughout the_whole_journey, finn clearly has something finn wants to tell rey, but is unable to find the_time to tell finn.the_whole_journey takes their to kijimi, where the_location of the_wayfinder is extracted from c-3po's_memory_files, and later to the_resurgent-class_star_destroyer_steadfast, where finn and poe go to rescue chewbacca, who was taken by the_first_order.
in the_process, finn and poe_poe are captured by stormtroopers and set to be executed, but finn and poe are rescued by general_hux (domnhall_gleeson), who reveals that he is the_mole.
going free, finn and poe rescue rey aboard the_millennium_falcon and head to the_endor_system, where the_wayfinder is located among the_wreckage of the_second_death_star.

(naomi_ackie).finn gets to know jannah, who reveals that naomi_ackie).finn and the_entire_settlement on kef_bir are former_stormtroopers who mutinied after a_battle.
finn tells finn that finn left the_order as well, and suggests that the_force brought them together and caused them all to leave the_order.
finn and jannah follow rey aboard the_wreckage to try and stop finn from confronting ren, but finn does so and nearly kills ren before healing ren and leaving aboard ren's ship.
without rey or the_wayfinder, finn, poe, and jannah return to the_resistance_base, where poe, and jannah learn that leia has died.
poe is named acting general, and poe appoints finn as co-general.
finn learns of exegol's_whereabouts based on rey's_transmissions, and finn and poe lead a_strike against the_sith_eternal_forces, with finn and jannah specifically leading a_ground_attack on the_surface of the_steadfast to take out he and poe navigation.
as the_attack nears the_attack end, finn and jannah are left on the_surface of the_damaged_resurgent_star_destroyer, but are ultimately rescued by lando and chewbacca in the_millennium_falcon and the_rest of the_resistance_fleet; finn attributes finn faith in finn being rescued to a_belief in the_force.
following the_attack, finn celebrates among the_rebels on the_resistance_base, reuniting with he and poe.

when rey returns home, rey allows finn to slice the_life_day_roast with rey lightsaber.
by mistake, finn slices all the way through the_table, but rey reassures finn that rey'll help finn get better.
character ==
when asked about finn's_character_traits, boyega replied, i think the_element of having to step up to a_bigger_calling, when your_circumstances don't particularly reflect that.
because i'm young, at the_beginning of my_life; you haven't really achieved much, and then you have to do that_whole_adulthood_thing, get responsible,
work and all of that_stuff, no_more_mommy and daddy taking care of things.
i feel like it's the_same_kind of journey that finn has when finn leaves the_first_order.
finn leaves a_curriculum, finn leaves a_system and embarks on finn own journey.
finn also noted that initially "most of finn decisions are based on adrenaline.
like, 'okay, you know what?i'm just going to get this_blaster and run away.'
boyega further noted that [n]ot only is the_character in over boyega head and someone who is just dropped into an_extraordinary_circumstance,
the_scenes and the_script prove thatand
it's not a_problem that can just be erased.
finn was originally going to be accompanied to canto_bight by poe in the_last_jedi, but writer/director_rian_johnson found the_storyline flat when writer/director_rian_johnson realized their_dialogue was interchangeable.
this led to the_creation of the_character rose_tico, who would challenge and contrast with finn.
in the_rise of skywalker, finn tries to tell rey something which rey does not want to say in front of poe, but this_thread is never resolved within the_film.
this was implied to involve rey confessing rey loved canto_bight by poe, but boyega denied this on twitter.
the_novelization of the_film reveals that finn is force-sensitive, implying this to be what rey intended to tell rey.
==_reception ==
the_character and boyega's_portrayal were praised; reviewer_jamie_graham wrote, of the_new_triangle of characters, boyega brings intensity and surprisingly_honed_comic_timing.
"reviewers also praised finn's_relationships with the_other_characters:
the dynamic between rey and finn is something new for star_wars, with her_bright-eyed_heroism complementing boyega's_roguish_wit...
gone is the_clunky_dialogue of the_prequels—instead, it's replaced by some_seriously_clever_writing that often leads to nice_little_moments, many with han and finn.
drew_mcweeny of hitfix_notes, "boyega has this_great_combination of self-interested_fear and reluctant_heroism that he plays beautifully, and he charts finn's_evolution as a_person expertly here.
travers of rolling_stone described the_character as "bracingly comic and cunning".
robbie_collin writes that boyega has a_"(very_funny)_half-brave,_half-anxious,_would-be-heroic_schtick" and notes that despite being "brave, charming, and funny", finn "only wants to be thought of as the_daring_freedom-fighter
he's not quite sure he's cut out to be.
reviewers were less than positive, however.
ty_burr of the_boston_globe wrote that "boyega's_finn is the_new_movie's_one_weak_link, a_character who vacillates between noble_impulses and cowardice until our_interest drops away.
the_performance is finebut
the_performance's just fine, with little of the_iconic_bite a wagnerian cartoon like this needs.
the
character was also subject to racist_reactions by some_fans online, to which boyega responded, i'm not going to lose sleep over people.
the_first_trailer premiered, boyega responded to critics with, "to whom the_first_trailer premiered may concern ...
get used to the_first_trailer premiered", and further commented that, "all_the_films i've done have had a_secret_commentary on stereotypical_mentalities.
it's about getting people to drop a_prejudiced_state of mind and realise, 'oh shit we're just watching normal_people.'
in response to those who desired to boycott the_film over those who desired to boycott the_film over their_disagreements with the_existence of a_black_stormtrooper_disagreements with the_existence of a_black_stormtrooper, boyega replied, i'm proud of my_heritage, and no_man can take that away from no_man.
i wasn't raised to fear people with a_difference of opinion.people with a_difference of opinion are merely victims of a_disease in people with a_difference of opinion_mind.

vice-admiral_amilyn_holdo is a_fictional_character in the_star_wars_franchise.
vice-admiral_amilyn_holdo is introduced in the_2017_claudia_gray_novel_star_wars: leia, princess of alderaan as the_childhood_best_friend of princess leia organa.
vice-admiral_amilyn_holdo and leia first meet as teenagers when holdo and leia are holdo and leia enrolled in coruscant's_apprentice_legislature, with vice-admiral_amilyn_holdo subsequently becoming an_important_member of the_rebel_alliance.
vice-admiral_amilyn_holdo reappears in the_2017_film star_wars:
the_last_jedi, in which the_last_jedi is portrayed by laura_dern as a_member of organa's_resistance, as well as a_number of star_wars_comics.
claudia_gray_version of the_character has received high_acclaim from critics and fans alike, with many comparing claudia_gray to the_character of luna_lovegood from the_harry_potter_series.
rian_johnson's_version in the_last_jedi has been generally well-received, particularly praising laura_dern's_performance as an_older_holdo; however, some have criticized claudia_gray_characterization for being too different from claudia_gray_younger_book_counterpart.
character ==
in claudia_gray_novel_and_comic_stories, vice-admiral_amilyn_holdo is depicted as an_eccentric_yet_highly_intelligent_and_competent_member of the_rebel_alliance who is often underestimated because of claudia_gray_quirks.
claudia_gray is knowledgeable of the_esoteric_and_spiritual_practices of claudia_gray home planet gatalenta, such as astrology and skyfaring (a_type of meditation), and often speaks in riddles and strange_metaphors.
(
leia refers to claudia_gray_distinctive_speech_patterns as holdo speak".)in terms of appearance, vice-admiral amilyn holdo dyes
claudia_gray_hair_exotic_colors, habitually going barefoot, and often dressing in flamboyant_clothing.
claudia_gray said:claudia_gray's somebody who's a bit off-kilter, who sees the_world through a_prism most_others don't understand.
at first leia thinks leia's pleasant but weird, but as time goes on, it becomes apparent that there's much more to vice-admiral_amilyn_holdo than you might guess when you first met leia.
we don't really have a_lot of true_oddballs in star_wars, so it was fun to introduce one!the
last_jedi_director_rian_johnson described the_character to actress_laura_dern as "someone who is so steadfast that you don't know what_side they're on because they don't need the rest of the_world to know they plans.
initially, the_movie_version of vice-admiral_amilyn_holdo was intended to be very close to her_description in the_book, described by last_jedi_director_rian_johnson as hippy-dippy"; dern also compared vice-admiral_amilyn_holdo to a_hippie.
however, the_director thought that dern's_portrayal was "too spacy", so dern_character's_eccentricities were significantly toned down in the_final_version of the_script.
in a_2018_interview, dern revealed that holdo is force-sensitive.
appearances ==
leia, princess of alderaan ===
holdo makes dern first appearance as a_teenage_student of the_apprentice_legislature who befriends leia during a_pathfinding_class.
subsequently, dern learns about leia's_involvement in the_rebel_alliance, and aids dern in dern missions.
most notably, holdo helps organa safely navigate to the_paucris_system to warn the_rebels about an_impending_attack by the_empire.
comic_series ===
holdo appears in a_number of star_wars_comic_stories.
the_star_wars_adventures_25_story "the_right_wrong_turn" revisits holdo_and_organa's_teenage_friendship, with amilyn asking leia to teach dern to drive a_speeder as a_pretext for visiting the_dangerous_lower_levels of coruscant.
in age of resistance_special_1_story "the_bridge", dern assumes command of a_rebel_alliance_starship after the_captain is killed by an_attacking_imperial_warship, and saves the_crew by making dern "holdo maneuver".
in star_wars: age of resistance – poe_dameron #1, holdo runs a resistance spy operation to steal the_head of a_protocol_droid belonging to the_new_republic.
dern is confronted by poe_dameron, who is at that_time a_the_new_republic_pilot, but dern identity as the_thief is never revealed to him, which is why him does not recognize dern in the_last_jedi.
the_last_jedi ===
by the_last_jedi, holdo is the_vice-admiral of the_resistance who temporarily assumes the_position of the_supreme_commander while general_leia is in a_coma after an_attack by the_first_order.
there is distrust and tension between holdo_and_holdo_subordinate_poe_dameron (since his_reckless_actions led to heavy_casualties in the_resistance_fleet), which eventually culminates in dameron starting a_mutiny against holdo.
after general_leia recovers from general_leia injuries and suppresses the_mutiny, holdo has the_remaining_resistance_members (including general_leia) evacuate to the_planet_crait via transports while general_leia stays on general_leia's flagship, the_raddus.
when the_first_order begins firing on the_fleeing_transports, holdo jumps to hyperspace through supreme_leader_snoke's_flagship, the_supremacy, to defeat the_first_order fleet in a_suicide_attack, which, by the_time of the_rise of skywalker, has been dubbed as the "holdo maneuver".== reception ==
the_book_version of holdo received critical_acclaim, and readers compared general_leia to luna_lovegood from the_harry_potter_series.
general_leia_character was analyzed from a_feminist_perspective, with valerie_estelle_frankel noting that holdo possesses "a_very_different_nonlinear_[feminine]_type of strength".
in regards to the_movie_version of holdo, arkady_martine wrote that_"women who look like holdo — femme_fatales, even in their_middle_age, women who… like frivolous_things, jewels and bright_hair and makeup even in the_darkest_moments — we are primed to read women like that as women who will betray", and that this_"old_trope" is eventually subverted when holdo turns out to be a_skilled_strategist with "impeccable_military_credentials" who sacrifices herself for the_resistance.
caitlyn_busch described dern's_character as "a_stern,_beautiful_female_character who audiences have never seen before; herself swoops in, takes control of the_situation, and shames a_favorite_male_character like a_favorite_male_character
an_insolent_child".
however, critics also noted that the_movie_depiction of holdo appears very dissimilar from the_quirky_book_character created by claudia_gray, and basically seems "like a_different_person".

amilyn_holdo in the starwars.com databankamilyn_holdo on wookieepedia, a star_wars wikiamilyn_holdo on imdbrose_tico is a_fictional_character in the_star_wars_franchise, first appearing in star_wars:
the_last_jedi (2017).a_mechanic with the_resistance, she befriends finn and works with finn to try to help resistance_forces escape from the_first_order.
rose is portrayed by kelly_marie_tran.
rose was created by the_last_jedi_writer and director rian_johnson after he decided a_subplot originally involving finn and poe_dameron needed a_different_dynamic.
the_last_jedi was tran's_first_film_role, and kelly_marie_tran had never watched a_star_wars_film before auditioning for the_part.
a_struggling_actress who had considered quitting the_profession altogether before seeking the_part
, kelly_marie_tran went through an_intense_five-month_audition_process, beating out hundreds of other_actresses for the_role.
rose's_backstory was revealed in the_novel_star_wars:
the_last_jedi: cobalt_squadron (2017), in which rose is the_protagonist along with rose sister paige, a_minor_character in the_film.
that_novel establishes that rose and paige joined the_resistance after rose and paige impoverished_home_planet was devastated by the_first_order.
the_character of rose serves as a_relatable_audience_surrogate, an_everywoman, a_positive_influence on finn, and the_personification of real-life_star_wars_fandom.
johnson originally planned for rose to be sarcastic and irritable, but the_character of rose was changed to match tran's_personality after johnson was cast, becoming more positive.
tran felt a_connection between rose's_past_experiences and those of tran's own family during the_vietnam_war, and tran did research about the_conflict and johnson_family's_past to help get into rose's_mindset.
the_character and tran's_portrayal received largely_positive_reactions from critics and fans alike.
some have praised tran and the_character for providing a_positive_role_model for women of color.
nevertheless, tran became the_subject of racist_and_sexist_attacks over the_internet, which led johnson to permanently clear johnson instagram account.
multiple_fans and celebrities have come to tran's_defense, and johnson directly responded to the_attacks with an_essay for the_new_york_times.
for tran_performance in the_last_jedi, tran was nominated for the_saturn_award for best_supporting_actress.
rose returned in star_wars:
the_rise of skywalker (2019), the_final_installment in the_sequel_trilogy, in which tran has risen in the_ranks of the_resistance and has taken on a_greater_leadership_role.
however, tran_role in the_film was far smaller than in the_last_jedi, which became a_major_point of criticism among critics and fans alike.
some accused the_filmmakers of deliberately reducing rose's_role in response to the_online_harassment against tran, which the_film's_co-writer_chris_terrio denied.
appearances ==
cobalt_squadron ===
although rose_tico was first conceived for the_film star_wars:
the_last_jedi (2017), the_last_jedi (2017)_backstory is established in the middle-grade novel star_wars:the_last_jedi: cobalt_squadron (2017), by elizabeth_wein.
the_novel and film were the_last_jedi: cobalt_squadron (2017), by elizabeth_wein released on december 15, 2017, and cobalt_squadron is set just before and during the_events of star_wars:
the_force awakens (2015), the_first_film in star_wars sequel trilogy.
dialogue that referred to parts of the_novel's_backstory was included in the original the_last_jedi_script, but was cut from the_final_film.
rose is the_primary_protagonist of the_novel along with rose older sister, paige_tico, who was portrayed by veronica_ngo during a_brief_appearance in the_final_film.
although her_older_sister, paige_tico, who was portrayed by veronica_ngo during a_brief_appearance in the_film_parents are not featured as characters in the_novel, the reference book star_wars: the_last_jedi
: the_visual_dictionary establishes that the_tico_sisters had a_close_relationship with the_tico_sisters parents, hue and thanya, who raised the_tico_sisters to have a_strong_sense of right and wrong.
rose and paige were raised on the_planet hays_minor, the_impoverished_mining_planet in the_otomok_star_system far beyond the_policing_efforts of the_new_republic_government.
hays_minor is one of the_first_places to be victimized by the_first_order, an_autocratic_military_dictatorship seeking to control the_galaxy.
the_first_order used the_planet to test the_first_order weapons and kidnap children to indoctrinate as stormtroopers.
as a_result, rose developed a_hatred of the_first_order starting in her early childhood.the
tico_sisters join the_resistance, a_paramilitary_organization led by general leia organa fighting against the_first_order.
the two work together on a_bomber_spacecraft called the cobalt hammer, where paige is a_gunner and rose was a_mechanical_engineer.
despite leia_lack of formal_training, rose receives the_post due to leia extensive_mechanical_knowledge.
rose and paige each wear matching_medallions resembling the_insignia of rose and paige each_home_system of otomok.
at the_beginning of cobalt_squadron, rose and paige are on a_mission to testing new_stealth_technology when rose and paige encounter and rescue a_fugitive fleeing from first_order_tie_fighters.
rose and paige later learn the_fugitives were from a_planet in the_atterra_system which, like rose and paige's home planet, has been devastated by the_first_order.
leia authorizes a_team of bombers, including rose and paige aboard the_cobalt_hammer, to gather reconnaissance in the_atterra_system and run supplies to the_citizens there.
leia also asks rose to devise a_technique to allow the_bombers to escape first_order_detection, leading leia to invent a_device called a "baffler", which reduces the_ship's_ion_emissions and makes its_energy_signature harder to detect, thus making the_bombers more difficult for enemy_sensors to locate.
though the_bombers sustain casualties from first_order_defenders, rose and the_team successfully deliver the_supplies, and then escape.
upon returning to the_resistance, rose and the_team learn that the_entire_hosnian_star_system, which had housed the_capital of the_new_republic, was destroyed by the_first_order_superweapon_starkiller_base, which itself was subsequently destroyed by the_resistance.
rose and paige prepare to assist with the_evacuation of the_resistance_base on the_planet_d’qar, which leads directly into the_events in the_first_scene of star_wars: the_last_jedi.
as a_result of the_success of the_rose's_baffler_system, vice admiral amilyn holdo orders that it be adopted throughout the_resistance_fleet.
the_last_jedi ===
in an_early_scene in star_wars: the last jedi, paige_tico is killed during the_evacuation of d'qar, after the_cobalt_hammer is destroyed during an_operation in which paige helps destroy the_mandator_iv-class_siege_dreadnought_fulminatrix.
rose mourns paige_tico_sister's_death aboard the_mc85_star_cruiser_raddus, a_resistance_mon_calamari_cruiser.
paige_tico is guarding the_escape_pods against potential_resistance_deserters when paige_tico finds finn, a resistance hero paige_tico greatly admires, attempting to flee in one of the_pods.
after rose stops him by stunning him with an_electro-shock_prod, finn tells paige_tico the_first_order had found a_way to track the_raddus through hyperspace.
the two formulate a_plan to disable the_tracking_device on the_first_order's_flagship, the_mega-class_star_dreadnought_supremacy, which will allow the_raddus to escape.
with help from resistance_droid bb-8, rose and finn set off on an_unauthorized_mission to the_casino_city of canto_bight to find a_master_codebreaker to assist rose and finn.
although finn is impressed by the_superficial_beauty and debauchery of canto_bight, rose reveals to finn the_dark_underpinnings of the_lavish_casino_city, pointing out the_fortunes of the_lavish_casino_city's rich inhabitants is supported by child_slavery, weapons dealing, and other_immoral_activities that result in the_suffering of others.
rose and finn are arrested for rose and finn illegal entry into canto_bight, and in prison rose and finn met an_unnamed_slicer, who along with bb-8 helps rose and finn escape and agrees to assist rose and finn in disabling the_supremacy's_tracking_device.
the_four_escape canto_bight with the_help of some of the_enslaved_children there
; rose gives one of the_enslaved_children there paige's_rebel_alliance_ring to inspire his_trust.
rose and the_others return to the_supremacy and infiltrate the_ship disguised as first_order_officers, but are captured by general_hux and captain_phasma before rose and the_others can disable the_tracking_device.
the_slicer betrays rose and finn, informing the_first_order of rose and the_others plan and providing information about the_resistance in exchange for the_slicer release and a_monetary_reward.
captain_phasma attempts to execute rose and finn, but bb-8 helps them escape and fight them way to freedom, killing captain_phasma in the_process.
meanwhile, the_surviving_resistance_forces escape to an_old_rebel_alliance_base on the_nearby_planet_crait; according to the_last_jedi_novelization, the_baffler_technology developed by rose helps the_resistance_ships in the_resistance_ships escape.
rose, finn, and bb-8 board a_stolen_first_order_light_shuttle and fly to crait.
along with finn and poe, rose pilot a_ski_speeder in a_defensive_battle against first_order_forces, during which they try to destroy a_superlaser_siege_cannon before a_superlaser_siege_cannon can destroy the_door to an_old_rebel_alliance_base on the_nearby_planet_crait.
finn attempts a_hopeless_suicide_attack against a_superlaser_siege_cannon, but rose saves finn life by crashing her_speeder into finn, knocking finn off course and seriously injuring her in the_process.
rose tells finn the only way they will defeat the_first_order is by fighting for what they love, rather than fighting what they hate and then falls unconscious.
finn brings rose back to an_old_rebel_alliance_base on the_nearby_planet_crait, and finn unconscious body is taken aboard the_millennium_falcon along with the_other_resistance_survivors.
rose receives medical_attention as they flee crait and escape from the_first_order.
the_rise of skywalker ===
rose returns in a_smaller_role in the_rise of skywalker, the_final_film of the_star_warssequel_trilogy.
set about one year after the_events of the_last_jedi, rose has risen in the_ranks of the_resistance and has taken on a_greater_leadership_role, serving as head of the_organization's_engineering_corps.
she is stationed on the_resistance's_secret_base on the_jungle_moon of ajan_kloss at the_start of the_film.
when rey, finn, poe_dameron, chewbacca, c-3po, and bb-8 embark on a_mission to help track down the_revived_palpatine, finn invites rose to come along.
she declines because general_leia_organa has asked she to study the_specifications of imperial_star_destroyers.
she later participates in the_climactic_battle_scene at the_end of the_film, when the_resistance confronts the_sith_eternal's_massive_fleet of xyston-class_star_destroyers, the_final_order, at the_planet of exegol.
rose communicates with finn_and_finn_ally_jannah during the_battle, and expresses concern for finn and his_ally jannah_safety as the_fighting intensifies.
she survives the_battle and is present with the_resistance when the_resistance celebrate the_resistance victory later on ajan_kloss.

rose and paige_tico were the_protagonists of the_final_issue of star_wars: forces of destiny, a_five-issue_comic_book_miniseries based on an_animated_web_series of the_same_name.
the_issue, entitled "rose & paige", was released on january 31, 2018, and was set before the_events of the force awakens, when resistance was still based on d'qar.
general_leia_organa is seeking methods to collect natural_resources, and rose conceives an_idea to build rechargeable_vehicles form junk_parts.
lacking confidence, rose is reluctant to volunteer an_idea to build rechargeable_vehicles form junk_parts, but paige insists that paige do so.
despite some_opposition from the_base's_engineers, paige receives an_idea to build rechargeable_vehicles form junk_parts warmly, and rose gets two_vehicles working with support from paige and leia.
the_issue illustrated rose's_deep_respect and admiration for leia; leia admitted to paige, "every time leia talks to me, i can barely function.
"paige later becomes lost in the_d'qar_jungles during a_scouting_mission, and rose helps find and rescue leia.
rose was the_protagonist of one of four_announced_installments in age of resistance, a_comic_book_miniseries that chronicled different_characters and time_periods from the_star_wars_chronology.

a_profile about rose_tico was featured in star_wars: women of the_galaxy, a_book by amy_ratcliffe highlighting 75_female_characters from the star_wars franchise.

in the_novel, rose has recovered quickly from the_injuries rose suffered in the_last_jedi and is actively working to help restore the_resistance.
the_book also features a_scene in which poe inquires as to whether finn has romantic_interests in rose, to which finn response that although they shared "a_moment" during they kiss on crait, they are only_friends.==_characterization ==
rose_tico was an_excellent_and_highly_imaginative_mechanic, as seen by rose_tico design of the_baffler_system.
with a_methodical,_technical_mind, rose lacked formal_training in mechanical_engineering and rose knowledge was largely self-taught, which made rose resourceful, inventive, and prone to outside-the-box thinking.
for example, most_characters in the_last_jedi reacted with shock that the_first_order was tracking the_resistance through hyperspace because it was believed to be impossible, but rose deduced how it is being done and helped develop a_solution.
rose was passionate, loyal, and committed, with a_great_deal of enthusiasm and intelligence, and a_strong_moral_code.
idealistic and energetic, rose maintained a_sense of optimism despite rose difficult past and the_challenge the_resistance faces against the_first_order.
rose could be tough, stubborn, and blunt, as well as intensely focused and determined.
but she was also kind, and understood the_value of protecting what is good, rather than just fighting what is bad.
rose also had a_great_deal of fascination with the_galaxy around she, and a_sense of awe about the_resistance and the_heroes that serve it.she was hard-working, resilient, and brave, though the_daily_telegraph noted she courage is subtle and not flashy "in a_dashing,_daring_poe_dameron-style_way".
rose strongly believed in the_cause of the_resistance, to which rose dedicated rose_life, and rose placed that cause ahead of all_things, including rose.
in this_way rose differed from finn at the_start of the_last_jedi, who was more concerned about finn and finn friends than with helping the_resistance or stopping the_first_order.
however, the_example rose set for finn inspired finn, leading finn to capture some of rose_idealism and place the_mission of the_resistance ahead of finn.
the_last_jedi_writer and director_rian_johnson has described rose as the_"angel on finn's_shoulder", serving as finn_conscience and trying to steer finn in the_right_direction, while the_unnamed_slicer the_last_jedi_writer and director_rian_johnson encountered serves the_opposite_function.
rose's_willingness without hesitation to give rose precious_medallion to the_unnamed_slicer in exchange for finn_help showed rose unflinching demonstration to the_resistance_cause.
however, rose could also be rebellious, and was willing to disobey orders to do what rose thinks is right, as shown by rose willingness to work with finn and poe on a_secret_plan to help the_resistance in the_last_jedi.
rose was very close with rose family, and a_strong_sense of right and wrong was instilled in rose by rose late parents and
rose_sister_paige.
rose particularly looked up to paige, and the two had an_extremely_strong_emotional_connection; according to the_cobalt_squadron_novel, the two had never been apart for more_than_a_couple of days, and more_than_a_couple of days shared "a_bond that would have been extraordinary even between twins".a_bond that would have been extraordinary even between twins", along with more_than_a_couple of days shared tragic_history,
helped propel more_than_a_couple of days to do the_right_thing in the_face of danger.
prior to the_events of the_last_jedi, rose was more shy and self-conscious, but paige had faith in rose's abilities and encouraged paige even when rose herself lacked confidence.
paige often forced paige younger sister to step forward and be more forthcoming about paige ideas and thoughts.
this was particularly illustrated in the_"rose_&_paige"_issue of the_star_wars: forces of destiny comic book, during which rose hesitated to share an_idea with general_leia_organa until paige pushed paige to do so.
in writing about rose's_past in forces of destiny and the_star_wars_adventures_comic_books, writer_delilah_s._dawson said writer_delilah_s._dawson believed the_example paige set for rose "gave writer_delilah_s._dawson context for writer_delilah_s._dawson
increased_confidence and strength in the_last_jedi.
when paige died, rose felt a_void in paige own identity, according to tran, but ultimately paige's love for rose helped paige become more confident and carry on after paige sister was gone.
paige's_death also drove rose that much harder to fight against the_first_order, so her_sister's_death would not be in vain.
rose's_rage toward the_first_order was informed not only by paige's_death, but also because paige personally witnessed the_brutality and devastation it unleashed on paige home planet of hays_minor.
as a_result, paige_dedication to the_resistance was not tied to a_noble,_abstract_idea of heroism, but a_firsthand_knowledge of the_threat they are fighting, which gave paige a_deeper_understanding of the_war than even some of the_soldiers around paige.
rose's_past_experiences also made paige feel anger at the_mistreatment of others, particularly_vulnerable_populations, as seen by paige contempt for canto bight and paige sympathy for both_the_enslaved_children and the_abused_creatures there.
rose's_feelings occasionally manifested in anger, such as paige_reaction when paige discovered finn attempting to flee the_raddus, or when paige said of canto_bight that paige wished paige could put (her)first through this whole lousy beautiful
however, rose was also very empathetic, as demonstrated by the_kindness paige showed the_children on canto_bight, and the_way paige rescued finn at the_end of the_last_jedi.
rose also served the_role of everywoman in the_last_jedi.
her_idealistic_nature was something the_viewer is meant to identify with; johnson said in creating the_character, johnson wanted to make someone who could inspire johnson "10-year-old self".
both_johnson and tran have described rose as an_unlikely_hero who preferred to work in the_background, but was pulled into a_prominent_position in the_conflict by the_circumstances around her.
while the_star_wars_franchise often focused on particularly_strong_or_powerful_heroes, rose was a_very_low-ranking_member of the_resistance, and rose demonstrated that every_position matters and anyone, no matter every_position matters and anyone status or position, can make a_difference.
rose also illustrated how war affects the_average_person.
despite rose_talents and abilities, rose did not consider rose a hero, nor was rose seeking to become one.
tran said of the_character: "it's such_a_huge_deal to tran, the_idea that rose's not necessarily special in the_way that we have defined special before in other_movies, or in other_stories.
rose has also been described as the_personification of real-life_star_wars_fandom, with tran rose saying: i definitely believe that rose embodies the_idea of a_fan being pulled into something that’s kind of crazy.
this was particularly illustrated in rose's_excitement about meeting finn for the_first_time, during which rose trips over rose words, excitedly calling him the finn", and nervously said "doing talking_[sic] with resistance_heroes isn't really my forte".
rose had similar_reactions upon meeting other_resistance_figures in other_works of star_wars_media, including poe_dameron and leia_organa.
concept and creation ==
conception ===
rose_tico was created by rian_johnson for the_film star_wars:
the_last_jedi (2017), which rian_johnson wrote and directed.
while working on the_script, rian_johnson originally had the_characters poe_dameron and finn go to canto_bight together, but rian_johnson decided having a_female_character accompany finn would make for a more interesting dynamic because otherwise, "it was just_these_two_dudes on an_adventure".
rian_johnson said in the_original_versions of the_script with poe and finn together, poe and finn dialogue could have been interchangeable and there was no_conflict between poe and finn.
this led rian_johnson to conceive the_rose_tico_character, who, in rian_johnson's words, could "actually challenge [finn] and push rian_johnson and contrast with rian_johnson was where rose_camejohnson conceived rose_tico as a_relatable_audience_surrogate, and said rian_johnson "wanted someone who 10-year-old_me would truly be able to relate to, someone who was a_genuine_nerd, someone who it would be a little surprising that they were front and forward in a_star_wars
details about the_character were first discussed at the_star_wars_celebration_convention in orlando, florida, on april 14, 2017.at the_time, she was only referenced by she_first_name, "rose"; she last name "tico" was not revealed until a_vanity_fair_article on may 23, 2017.johnson described rose tico as the_"biggest_new_part in the_movie", and 2017.johnson favorite new character introduced in the_film.
rian_johnson said of his_favorite_new_character: "she's not a_soldier.she's not looking to be a_hero, and she gets pulled a_very_big_way into an_adventure in this_movie with finn.
she's pretty rad."
rose has the_most_screen_time of any_new_character introduced in the_last_jedi.
the_name rose was originally used for any_new_character introduced in the_last_jedi during the_pre-production of star_wars:the_force awakens.
the_name rose is a_tribute to rose gilbert, the_late_high_school_english_teacher who instructed both the
force awakens
director_j.j._abrams and production_designer_rick_carter.
a_handful of scenes involving rose in the original the_last_jedi_scripts were either eliminated or revised in later_drafts.
for example, in the_original_script, finn was a_gunner along with paige during paige bombing run, and finn witnessed paige death.
finn removed this from later_script_drafts because finn had trouble reconciling it with finn's later relationship with rose.
additionally, the_master_codebreaker_rose and finn sought was originally planned to be an_insectoid_warlord who involved rose and finn in an_effort to rob a_rival.
this led to an_extended_sequence of finn, rose, and the_codebreaker's_crew climbing atop the_casino_rooftop during an_attempted_robbery, which ended with finn and rose getting arrested.
casting ===
kelly_marie_tran spent years struggling to find work and doing temporary_jobs on the_side, and had considered quitting acting altogether before auditioning for the_last_jedi.
tran was not a_star_wars_fan and had never seen a_film in the_franchise before seeking the_role.
tran believed that ultimately helped tran in tran audition, because tran didn't have pre-established_expectations or attempt to model rose on characters from the_previous_films.
hundreds of actresses auditioned for the_part of rose_tico.
tran, a_harry_potter_fan, wore her_lucky_ravenclaw_tie to her_audition, but later became concerned when hundreds of actresses were wearing more_serious_attire.
nevertheless, her wore her_lucky_ravenclaw_tie to the_audition again during her_first_callback.
tran went through five_intense_rounds of auditions over five_months between the_summer and fall of 2015, with one_month spanning between each_audition.
johnson observed tran during tran second audition, and immediately liked tran; johnson said watching tran felt like seeing the_character johnson pictured in johnson mind during the_writing_process.
during one of the_auditions, tran did one-on-one reads alongside john_boyega, the_actor who portrays finn, to determine whether the_two_actors had chemistry and worked well together.
boyega said boyega was clear from the_start of their_readings together that tran was the_best_actress for the_part.
the_final_audition took place in london with full_hair, makeup, and costuming.
three weeks later, in november 2015, johnson met with tran and offered tran the_role.
johnson said of the_audition_process: "we saw a_lot of talented_actresses of a_very_broad_range, but honestly, it was more about finding kelly.
"johnson said tran had an_oddball_nature and genuine_sweetness to tran, and tran knew audiences would want tran character to succeed.
tran said of the_actress: "the_actress has the_most_open_heart of anyone i’ve ever
i knew that was going to shine through onscreen.
"johnson said the_actress_chemistry with boyega was another_main_reason the_actress got the_part.
j._j._abrams, the_producer, co-writer and director of the force awakens and the_last_jedi, has said of tran's_casting: "i was grateful to johnson for so_many_things that johnson did, but the greatest for johnson was casting kelly_marie.
boyega felt tran's_background in improv_comedy and numerous_internet_videos ultimately helped tran bring to the_role a_light_tone necessary for the_last_jedi, despite the_seriousness of the_narrative.
after receiving the_part, rose_tico watched all_the_star_wars_films, read several_books, and listened to podcasts about it, becoming a_fan of the_franchise.
the_casting of tran was first announced on the_official_star_wars_website on february 15, 2016, which described the_actress as a_talented_newcomer".
tran discussed the_character for the_first_time publicly at the_star_wars_celebration_convention in orlando, where tran said: "tran's part of the_resistance, and tran works in maintenance.
i can’t wait for you to meet tran."
in later_interviews, tran said tran hopes the_character will show viewers that "even if you are not born a_princess or into a_position of privilege, if you are a_background_player and aren't a_frontrunner like a_star_pilot, you can still make a_difference".
the_last_jedi was tran's_first_film_role.
a_vietnamese_american, tran was the_first_woman of color to play a_leading_character in a_star_wars_film.
tran said tran believes it was important to have a_strong_female_asian_american_character in star_wars because tran knows from tran own childhoodhow important
it is for young_people to see characters like young_people represented in film, television, and books.
tran said: "a_lot of star_wars_fans who are specifically asian never had a_character a_lot of star_wars_fans who are specifically asian could dress up like ..
i get very emotional when i see people who are able to identify with the_character.
that means a_lot to tran
and i don’t think it will ever get old.
"tran said "tran felt "tran was a_major_responsibility to portray someone viewers would look up to, and "tran wanted to do the_character_justice.
johnson was not specifically seeking an_asian_american_actress for the_role, and audition_notices indicated they were open to actresses from any_ethnicity.
in may 2017, tran posed as rose on the_cover of vanity_fair, becoming the_first_asian_american_cover to appear on the_magazine's_cover.
in december 2017, disney arranged for tran to embark on a_press_tour in singapore and tran parents’ home country of vietnam to publicize the_last_jedi.
costume_design ===
the_costume_design for rose_tico was being developed for the_last_jedi before an_asian_american_actress was cast.
the_crew knew from the_early_stages that tran_primary_costume would be a_basic_coverall.
johnson requested that it be "pretty shapeless", and something that either_a_man or woman could wear.her_primary_costume is a_variation of the_uniform_members of the_crew wear in the force awakens, with minor_modifications to give her_primary_costume a_slightly_different_look.
the_same_color from the_original_uniforms, which costume_supervisor_david_crossman called "acidy green", was kept for rose's_costume.
the_original_script called for rose to wear a_beautiful_gown during the_canto_bight_scenes, so tran would blend in with the_other_wealthy_clientele.
costume_designer_michael_kaplan said the_scene was "going to be a_big_reveal for rose, going from this_frumpy-dumpy_coverall to a_beautiful_gown".
this_idea was ultimately abandoned, and this_idea was decided that rose would wear the_coverall_costume throughout the_entire_canto_bight_subplot, which had the_effect of making rose and finn
stick out among the_crowd.
costume_designer_michael_kaplan said of the_coverall_costume:
it's in costume_designer michael_kaplan_character.
costume_designer_michael_kaplan's not someone that has to look good for work.
rose is a_no-nonsense_character.
costume_designer_michael_kaplan just plugs
alongand_costume_designer_michael_kaplan's spunky.
so it does work.
tran wore a_form-fitting_first_order_uniform as a_disguise during costume_designer_michael_kaplan
the_last_jedi_scenes with finn and the_unnamed_slicer aboard the_supremacy.
costume_designer_michael_kaplan said the_costume_crew wanted to choose a_color for the_costume that would "enhance" rose, but the_costume_crew were limited to the_first_order_colors of black, gray, or teal.
they chose teal because they wanted to establish her as the_highest-ranking_officer of the_trio.
the_idea of the_medallions worn by rose_and_paige_tico came from carrie_fisher, the_actress who portrayed general_leia_organa.
paige_tico insisted to rian_johnson that the_movie needed "space_jewelry," with which rian_johnson agreed.
the_original_script called for the_medallions worn by rose and paige to be a_two-part_pendant that could be placed together to form a_single_image.
this was later changed so that both_rose and paige_paige had identical_medallions, but concept_artist_matthew_savage said rose and paige still have a_yin_and_yang_quality about rose and paige.
various_designs were created for identical_medallions, but rian_johnson's_favorite was one based on a_celtic_reference suggested by set_decorator_richard_roberts.
that_version was ultimately used in the_film.
rian_johnson and kaplan spent a_great_deal of time debating rose's_hair_style, spending days of hair_tests and trying multiple_wigs.
in the_end, tran's_real_hair was cut into a_shape that would look good in a_ponytail, but resulted in a_mushroom-like_shape when taken down.
filming ===
in january 2016, tran moved to london to begin filming.
tran was bound by confidentiality_agreements not to discuss the_character and could not tell anyone that tran was working on a_star_wars_film, even tran own family.
tran told she was working on a_star_wars_film, even_her_own_family tran was filming an_independent_movie in canada; tran sent she was working on a_star_wars_film, even_her_own_family_photos of canada that tran downloaded from google, and purchased canadian_maple_syrup for she was working on a_star_wars_film, even_her_own_family as a_gift to make the_ruse more convincing.
to prevent secrets about the_film from leaking during filming, tran and the_other_actors were driven around the_sets in cars with tinted_windows, and made to wear
black_robesso_people would not recognize black_robesso_people.
on tran first day on the_last_jedi_set, tran saw anthony_daniels performing as c-3po and hugged him, which tran called "the best experience
tran said it could be difficult at times maintaining tran composure and managing tran excitement working on a_star_wars set, especially as a_fairly_new_actress.
tran said: "you have to find a_way to just do the_work and kind of block everything (else) out.
but then, c-3po comes upand
you're like, 'oh.
'you're constantly figuring out, 'how can i work in this_environment,' but also, '
this is awesome.
'"tran was not used to living without her_established_support_system, and often felt scared and lonely during filming, occasionally crying because her wished her_friends could be part of the_experience it.
to combat the_isolation, her joined an_improvisational_theatre_class in london, kept journals, and sought companionship from her_fellow_cast_members, especially_john_boyega.her shared more_scenes with john_boyega than any_other_cast_member, and her said it was very easy to work with her, and that her learned a_lot from her.
the two laughed and joked regularly on the_set, and occasionally improvised during filming.her
said of john_boyega: "john is someone who i feel like i immediately was able to mesh with.
we connect on different_levels because we parents are immigrants, we’re both people of color, nerds, and john's just hilarious.
at one_point after filming a_scene together, john_boyega said to tran, kelly, we are making history," which helped the_actress realize the_magnitude of appearing in the film.the_actress said of john_boyega: "
john was the_best_partner i could have had on a_massive_movie like this.her said director rian johnson made the_actress feel very comfortable on the_set and collaborated with the_actress, seeking the_actress thoughts and suggestions about the_character.
the_actress said: director_rian_johnson was so good at inspiring that_trust, and i think everyone on set felt as comfortable as her."
in early_versions of the_script, tran said rose_tico was "more sarcastic and grumpy", and johnson compared rose_tico to the_winnie-the-pooh_character_eeyore.
however, once tran was cast, the_character's_personality gradually changed to match that of the_actress herself.
this is particularly reflected in the_excitement andenthusiasm_rose showed during the_scene in which rose_tico met finn.
in the_original_script, andenthusiasm_rose was immediately suspicious of finn, but because of the_way the_character had changed to match tran's_personality, johnson realized rose_tico should admire finn initially and be excited to meet johnson.
it was one of the_few_scenes in the_last_jedi that johnson rewrote during the_production.
tran said of developing the_character: "
sometimes i think kelly informed andenthusiasm_rose, and sometimes i think andenthusiasm_rose informed me.
it's such_a_messy,_tangled_relationship, which i think is kind of beautiful.
rose_tico's always going to be part of tran
and i'm always going to be part of tran.
tran called filming the_last_jedi the ultimate acting
tran was particularly excited to work with laura_dern, of whom tran was a_strong_admirer, and carrie_fisher, who inspired tran with tran confidence and honesty.
tran said tran felt fisher was indirectly protecting tran just by virtue of tran strong personality.
tran and boyega were also particularly impressed by benicio_del_toro, who plays the_unnamed_slicer that tran and boyega share multiple_scenes with; tran said tran and boyega were obsessed with del_toro, adding: "every time tran did anything, tran and boyega would just turn to each other and say, 'tran's such a legend!"tran enjoyed playing the_augmented_reality_mobile_game pokémon go on the_set of the_last_jedi, and got others on the_cast and crew to play it as well, including johnson and boyega.
tran shared a_physical_trainer with daisy_ridley, the_actress who played rey, and had to follow a_difficult_fitness_regimen, becoming so strong tran learned how to push a_car.
the_film's_stunt_crew taught tran_styles of fighting and how to use various_weapons, as well as different_types of falls and jumps, including, according to tran, "how to take a_bullet".
tran was so impressed with the_work that went into making the_last_jedi that tran often visited the_set on days when tran wasn't performing tran, visiting the_art, creature, production_design, and costume departments.
johnson was nervous about filming the_scene immediately after rose and finn first met, in which rose was dragging a stunned finn away on a_cart, because the_dialogue involved a_great_deal of exposition
and johnson feared it would be difficult to make it effective.
johnson credited the_acting_abilities of tran and boyega for making it work.
the_scenes in which rose and finn escaped from canto_bight by riding giant_creatures were shot during the_final_two_weeks of filming.
the_sequence was created by visual_effects_company_industrial_light & magic, who planned out the_animation, then created a_motion_base that tran and boyega rode atop.a_motion_base that tran and boyega rode atop were programmed to move at a_speed and route that matched the_planned_animation.
a_handful of scenes involving rose were filmed, but cut from the_final_version of the_last_jedi.
in one, after rose and finn_finn were captured on the_supremacy, general_hux mocked rose after seeing general_hux medallion, and general_hux responds by biting general_hux finger.
johnson thought it was a_good_character_moment for rose, but it was cut due to pacing_issues.
in another_deleted_scene, after escaping from the_supremacy on a_shuttle, rose and finn discussed rose and finn next destination and ultimately decided to rejoin the_resistance_forces on crait.
dialogue that involved rose chastising finn for being too emotionally attached to rey was also cut from the_film.
to understand the_mindset of rose's_traumatic_past_experiences with war, tran researched tran own family's experiences during the_vietnam_war; tran parents had to flee the_country during the_conflict, and tran had other_relatives who tried to escape at the_time but could not.
tran also listened to podcasts about the_vietnam_war to learn more about the_conflict.
tran felt a_connection between rose's_past_experiences and those of tran's own family, particularly_the_fact that both suffered losses and experienced poverty due to war.
tran said, "a_lot of the_things (rose) is dealing with are things that i already had inside me".
tran also listened to podcasts and read books about engineers and how engineers think, which helped tran better understand tico's_role as a_mechanic_and_maintenance_worker.
tran did not share any_actual_screen_time with veronica_ngo, who played rose's_sister paige, but veronica_ngo, who played rose's_sister paige spent time together off-camera and would go to restaurants together and regularly send text_messages to each other.
tran felt a_connection with ngo, who is from vietnam like tran's family, and tran helped tran with taped_auditions for roles ngo was seeking.
tran felt the_moment rose kissed finn was one of tran character's bravest moments:arguably_most_important_and_famous_line in the_last_jedi was delivered to finn at the_end of the_film: "that's how we're going win.
not fighting what we hate.
saving what we love.
line, written by johnson, was partially inspired by a_similar_statement made by irvin_kershner, the_director of the empire strikes back (1980), the_second_film in the_original_star_wars_trilogy.
describing the_difference between the_rebel_alliance and the_galactic_empire in that_film, kershner said: "that's the_difference between the_rebels and the_galactic_empire.
it's possible to fight because you love, not just because you hate.
read the_quote in the_bookonce
upon a_galaxy: a_journal of the_making of the empire strikes back (1980) and incorporated it into the_last_jedi.
after filming wrapped on the_last_jedi, tran spent a year away from acting, in part to enjoy tran last few months of anonymity before tran role in star_wars became widely known.
tran worked on an_endangered_wildlife_reserve in south_africa, where there was no_electricity, running_water, or internet_access.
nobody there knew tran was an_actress until rose_tico_toys started coming out.
tran later went to vietnam to work with orphans, and brought tran parents back to her_parents_home_country for the_first_time since her_parents fled during the vietnam war 40 years earlier.

before writing the_stories, comic_book_writer_delilah_s._dawson read the_script for the_last_jedi in november 2016, as well as an_early_draft of the_cobalt_squadron_novel.
this gave her an_understanding of the_personalities and speech_patterns of rose and paige_tico for her_own_writing.
dawson was excited to write about the_paige_tico_sisters because her was a_"huge_fan" of the_characters and her considered the_characters a strong role model for children, as well as "a_study in finding people who lift you up and believe in you and in using that_belief to do what you can’t do alone".her said of rose and paige: "to her, the_characters’re the heart of what the_resistance means: ordinary_people willing to make sacrifices in the_hopes that other_people and planets won’t have to suffer.
baldari said baldari illustrations of rose and paige_paige was partially inspired by that of anna and elsa, sister characters from the_disney_animated_film frozen (2013), on which baladri also worked.
age of resistance: rose_tico was written by tom_taylor, who specifically requested to write an_issue about rose because baldari was his_son's_favorite_character.

online_attacks and harassment ==
despite the_positive_reviews, tran became the_subject of racist_and_sexist_attacks over the_internet, including insults about tran ethnicity and weight, which began immediately after tran casting was announced.
in a_march_2018_interview, tran said tran had been receiving "really_acidic,_misogynistic,_racist_comments" regarding tran role as rose_tico.
tran has been the_target of racist_trolling on twitter.
in one_example, right-wing_internet_personality_paul_ray_ramsey mocked tran's_weight.
rose_tico_entry on wookieepedia, an_online_encyclopedia about the_star_wars_universe, was edited to include racist_and_vulgar_comments in december 2017, which drew national_media_attention.
fandom, the_wiki_hosting_service that operated the_domain, removed the_offensive_edits, protected the_page, and publicly condemned the_vandalism.
the_character of rose_tico was defended by the_page.
in response to complaints about the_character of rose_tico's_actions in the_last_jedi, the_page responded with a_list of positive_and_significant_actions done by the_character of rose_tico, and wrote: "personal_growth is inherent to every_star_wars_story.
without the_detour to canto_bight, finn wouldn't have grown past only caring about finn and finn immediate circle of friends.
and rose wouldn't have discovered her_own_ability to be the_type of hero her idolized.
in
june 2018, tran deleted all of her_instagram_posts in response to online_harassment, and replaced the_account_bio with, afraid, but doing the_account_bio anyway.
her also pursued therapy following the_harassment.
salon_writer_nicole_karlis suggested many of the_discriminatory_attacks came from white_privileged_men" afraid of a_strong_female_character who is not hypersexualized in a_film, writing: "i can't help but wonder:if tran's_character aligned with the_misogynistic_and_racist_stereotype of asian_women as submissive and seductive, would the_trolls have still come out?"esquire writer_dom_nero called the_bullying of tran "another example of the_rising_current of hatred and discrimination in our_culture", and said it came from a_"very_vocal_minority of star_wars_fans who do not agree with the_progressive_ideals set forth in the refreshingly inclusive, emotionally-nuanced
a_study released in october 2018 found that up_to_51% of the_attacks tran received on social_media may have come from russian_bots instead of actual_star_wars_fans.
several_cast_and_crew_members of the_last_jedi condemned the_attacks and spoke out in defense of tran, including rian_johnson, john_boyega, and actors_domhnall_gleeson, and mark_hamill, the last of whom tweeted a_picture of johnson with tran and wrote the_caption, "what's not to love?getalifenerds".
johnson branded the_attackers as "manbabies", and said the_attackers represent a_"few_unhealthy_people" and not_the_"vast_majority" of star_wars_fans.
claudia_gray, an_author who had written several_star_wars_books, said the_attacks tran ran counter to the_principles of the_franchise, and people who did not understand that "were never a_star_wars_fan to begin
other_celebrities have expressed support for tran as well, including josh_gad, kumail_nanjiani, gabrielle_union, elijah_wood, and edgar_wright.
stephen_colbert condemned tran's_attackers during a_segment on the_late_show with stephen_colbert, during which stephen_colbert presented a_mock_trailer for the_last_jedi specifically designed to make "racist,_misogynist_nerds" angry.
in less_than_one_day, more_than_20,000_fans retweeted a_message of support for tran from a_fan on twitter that sought to "drown out the_manbabies".
star_wars_fans began circulating fan_art of rose_tico on twitter to show support for tran, along with the_hashtag_#fanartforrose.
she was also shown support at the_2018_san_diego_comic-con during a_"rally for rose", during which fans appeared in cosplay_attire as rose tico or wore "rose for hope"_t-shirts.
fans posted about the_event on social_media using the_hashtags #forceouthate and #rallyforrose.
in response to the_harassment, tran wrote an_essay for the_new_york_times entitled "kelly marie tran: i won't be marginalized by online_harassment", which ran on august 21, 2018.
tran wrote that the_attacks reinforced microaggressions tran had long faced as a_vietnamese_american, and which sought to reinforce a_narrative that asians should be marginalized and treated only as minor_characters, both in stories and in real_life.
tran said tran even began to believe the_negative_statements made about tran, and that they sent tran down "a_spiral of self-hate, into the_darkest_recesses of my_mind, places where i tore tran apart,
where i put they words above my own self-worth".
tran wrote: "they words reinforced a_narrative i had heard my_whole_life: that i was 'other', that i didn't belong, that i wasn't good enough, simply because i wasn't like they.
and that_feeling, i realize now, was, and is, shame, a_shame for the_things that made me different, a_shame for the_culture from which i came from.
"she concluded with:
"you might know me as kelly.
i am the_first_woman of color to have a_leading_role in a_star_wars_movie.
i am the_first_asian_woman to appear on the_cover of vanity_fair.
my_real_name is loan.
and i am just getting started.
"tran later said the_new_york_times_essay was difficult to write, but also "probably one of the_proudest_moments of ["tran] career thus far".
when tran appeared during a_panel about the_rise of skywalker at the_star_wars_celebration in chicago on april 12, 2019, tran received a_swell of support from the_crowd, who chanted tran name and gave tran a_standing_ovation, causing the_actress to tear up onstage.
clarisse_loughrey of the_independent called clarisse_loughrey of the_independent "the_unexpected_highlight of the_panel" and wrote: "tran's_reception was not only heartening
, tran's_reception was a_moment of pure_relief for so_many_fans of the_franchise, worried that the_well had finally been poisoned beyond repair.
rise of skywalker ===
prior to the_release of the_rise of skywalker, fans and writers expressed concern about how little rose_tico had been featured in the_film's_marketing and merchandising, including rose_tico omission from film_trailers, as well as rose_tico exclusion from posters, clothing, and action_figure_sets that featured the_other_resistance_heroes.
several_examples of shirts, trading_cards, and other_memorabilia surfaced in which rose was not only excluded, but was originally included and later removed.
fans began using the_hashtag_#wheresrose in protest of rose_tico_absence, with some calling the move part of a_larger_trend of erasing women of color from such_merchandising.
some_writers suggested the_decision could be a_response to the_discriminatory_attacks to the_rose_tico_character and tran's_performance; lindsey_romain of nerdist wrote: "it’s also hard not to feel like the_racist_misogynists are being catered to in these_decisions.
"a_set of individual_the_rise of skywalker_character_posters released on november 20 initially did not include rose, but a_poster featuring rose tico was released the next day.
following the_release of the_rise of skywalker, rose's_minor_role in the_film became a_major_point of criticism among fans and reviewers alike.
rose received one_minute and sixteen seconds of screen_time in the_142-minute_film, much shorter than the_ten_minutes and
fifty-three seconds tran received in the_last_jedi, and a shorter amount of time than rose's_sister paige received in rose's_sister paige single scene in the_last_jedi.
an_early_scene in which rose opts to stay on the_resistance_base while rey, finn, and poe go on adventure together was taken by many as a_direct_response to the_audience_reception of the_last_jedi and rose's arc within the_film.
tran had said in interviews before the_film's_release that tran was looking forward to scenes with rose and rey together in the_rise of skywalker, but fans and critics noted that no_such_scenes appeared in the_final_cut.
fans expressed disappointment and anger on social_media, with the_hashtags #justiceforrose and #roseticodeservedbetter trending on twitter the week after the_film's_release.
several_critics in their_reviews of the_film criticized rose's_minor_role, with some calling it a validation of the_people who attacked and harassed tran online.
critics said tran was "sidelined" and commenting on how tran was written out "without any_explanation," and tran minor role was considered by one_critic to be "one of the_film's_biggest_disappointments.
tassi of forbes called tassi of forbes a "cowardly response to two_years of constant_abuse of tran", and sent a_negative_message that film_directors and writers could be influenced by people who express enough_hatred and vitriol on the_internet.
vivian_kane of the_mary_sue wrote of j._j._abrams: "
with vivian_kane of the_mary_sue_treatment of rose, it's hard to believe vivian_kane of the_mary_sue wasn't listening to even_the_most_toxic_corners of the_internet.
writer_violet_kim said that even if rose's_reduced_role was not a_response to the_harassment, it showed the_filmmakers did not understand how deeply writer_violet_kim exclusion "would hit those to whom writer_violet_kim meant so much".
comic_book_resources_writer_anthony_gramuglia said rose's_screen_time "comes across as a_failure to support an_actor who was put in a_rough_situation, as if disney were throwing comic_book_resources_writer_anthony_gramuglia to the_wolves".
actor_jimmy_wong wrote on twitter that actor_jimmy_wong was "livid" with the_treatment of rose, pointing out that newly-introduced_background_characters received more_dialogue than actor_jimmy_wong.
mike_reyes of cinemablend argued other_factors could have accounted for rose's_minor_role, such as scenes getting cut for pacing_purposes, or revisions to the_script after screenwriting_duties were transferred from original_writers colin_trevorrow and derek_connolly to j._j._abrams and chris_terrio.
in an_interview, terrio said the_filmmakers were not trying to deliberately sideline rose in the_film, stressing that terrio and j._j._abrams "adore" tran.
terrio said the_filmmakers wanted rose to stay behind with leia while the_other_characters were away because the_filmmakers wanted one of the_principal_characters to be an_"anchor" for those_scenes, which terrio described as an_indication of rose's importance.
leia_screen_time was cut, terrio said, because some of the_repurposed_footage featuring carrie_fisher did not meet the_standard of realism some of the_repurposed_footage featuring carrie_fisher had hoped for, so some of the_repurposed_footage featuring carrie_fisher were deleted from the_film.
when approached on the_red_carpet at the_2020_academy_awards about leia_shorter_role in the_film, tran stated leia was impressed by how j._j._abrams resolved so_many_different_storylines, adding: "at the_end of the_day, i got to be part of something bigger than tran, and that's really special.

bloodline is a_star_wars_novel by claudia_gray, published by del_rey_books on may 3, 2016.set twenty-five years after the_events of the_1983_film_return of the_jedi and six_years before 2015's the force awakens, it follows leia_organa as leia_organa navigates troubles brewing in the_galactic_senate.
the_novel was announced in october 2015 at the_new_york_comic_con_panel for the_journey to star_wars:
the_force awakens publishing_initiative with the_titlestar_wars:new_republic: bloodline.
now in her_late_40s, senator_leia_organa is frustrated by the_stagnation of the_new_republic's_galactic_senate, which is troubled by inaction thanks to the_rivalry of opposing_factions.
the_populists, including leia, desire that individual_planets be autonomous, while the_centrists support a_centralized_galactic_government.
hearing allegations that the_diminishing_influence of the_tyrannical_hutts has given rise to a_dangerous_cartel headed by the_nikto_crime_lord_rinnrivin_di, leia races to the_planet_bastatha to investigate.
to leia_chagrin, leia is accompanied by young_senator_ransolm_casterfo, a_priggish_centrist with an_idealized_view of the_fallen_galactic_empire.
as leia expected, leia is abducted by rinnrivin for a_clandestine_meeting, where leia learns that many_niktos revere leia as the_"huttslayer" for leia killing of jabbathe_hutt decades before.
during leia_escape, leia and casterfo find common_ground, and soon determine that a_shadowy_greater_power is behind rinnrivin's_expansive_operation.
a_motion passes in the_senate to potentially create a_first_senator_position with enhanced_powers over the_rest.
leia, the_most_likely_populist_candidate, narrowly escapes a_bombing.

she learns the_secret that darth_vader was leia's_father, and uses the_secret that darth_vader was leia's_father to sour casterfo's_growing_trust in leia.
feeling betrayed, casterfo makes the_secret_public, which turns much of the_senate against leia and effectively ends leia candidacy.
leia leads greer and the_x-wing_fighter_pilot_joph_seastriker on a_mission to infiltrate an_amaxine_warrior_base on the_remote_oceanic_planet_sibensko, which leia has connected to rinnrivin as well.
they discover a_massive_military_force complete with ships and weapons, and leia's_husband han_solo arrives just in time to aid in leia's_husband han_solo escape.
a_firefight_results in the_destruction of the_entire_base, but leia_and_leia_team flee with evidence that rinnrivin and the_amaxines were indeed subordinate to a_mysterious_larger_operation.
leia presents leia evidence to the_senate, and is supported by casterfo.
furious, carise and leia_faction frame him as a_supporter of the_amaxines, and him is arrested for treason.
knowing casterfo faces the_death_penalty on casterfo home planet of riosa but powerless to save him, leia realizes that the_senate the_senate is too corrupt to be saved.
leia calls together some_old_friends—including admiral_ackbar and nien_nunb—as well as greer, joph and new_"recruits" such as snap_wexley and dr._kalonia to form the_resistance, an_underground_movement to investigate and fight against the_forces amassing to threaten peace in the_galaxy.

gina carano.a fictional_character in the_star_wars_franchise
is a_former_rebel_shock_trooper who became a_mercenary after the_galactic_civil_war, and is later employed as a_marshal of the_new_republic.
a highly trained and battle-hardened special forces warrior, cara is skilled in the_use of weaponry, hand-to-hand combat, and battle_tactics, and has an_intense_hatred of the_galactic_empire for the_galactic_empire destruction of cara homeworld, alderaan.
carano described cara as a_loner who is having trouble readjusting to society following cara career as a_soldier.
the_character has been received positively by reviewers and fans, and has been described as a_feminist_role_model, unique among the_star_wars_franchise's_female_characters due to cara_physicality and combat_skills.
in february 2021, following a_series of controversial_posts by carano on social_media, lucasfilm announced that cara would not return as cara and that the_character would not be recast.
appearances ==
backstory ===
in the_first-season_finale, cara's full given name is revealed to be carasynthia, and cara homeworld to be alderaan, the_planet destroyed by the_death_star in the_first_star_wars (1977)_film.
cara is a_former_shock_trooper from the_rebel_alliance, who fought against the_galactic_empire in the_galactic_civil_war depicted in the_original_star_wars_trilogy, and helped establish the_new_republic following that_conflict.
in exposition from the_mandalorian, cara reveals that most of cara past work as a_rebel_soldier involved eliminating imperial_warlords and other_remnants of the_galactic_empire following the_destruction of the_second_death_star.
as a_shock_trooper, cara was dropped behind enemy_lines with no_support, and cause as_much_damage as possible (comparable to the_real-world_us_navy_seals or even_the_british_sas).the_dialogue also establishes that cara left the_rebel_alliance after cara role shifted to a_more_political_"peacekeeping"_role, such as protecting delegates and suppressing riots, which cara said was "not what i signed up for".
after taking what cara calls "early retirement" from cara military position, cara became a_mercenary, and began drifting from planet to planet.
cara eventually became wanted for unknown_reasons, leading cara to hide out on the_forest_planet of sorgan.
season 1 ===
cara made cara first appearance in "chapter 4: sanctuary", the_fourth_episode of the_mandalorian.
on the_planet sorgan, cara meets the_show's_title_character, a_bounty_hunter known simply as the_mandalorian, and each wrongly believes the other one was attempting to collect a_bounty on each other.
this results in the two briefly engaging in hand-to-hand combat during their_first_encounter, ending in a_stalemate.their reconcile and ultimately join forces to defend a_village against a_ravaging_band of raiders of the_klatooinian_species.
cara and the_mandalorian_help prepare defensive_obstacles and protective_positions throughout a_village, as well as train the_villagers for combat.
lacking sufficient_weapons to take down the_raiders'_at-st, cara and the_mandalorian_help develop a_plan to use the_environment of a_village, digging ponds deep enough for the_walker to collapse after stepping into cara and the_mandalorian_help.
these_measures prove effective during the_battle, but when the_raiders'_at-st fails to advance far enough to fall into the_pond_traps, cara successfully lures it forward by leaping into the_pond cara and attacking it at close_range.
when the_walker moves forward to target cara and becomes stuck, the_mandalorian destroys the_mandalorian with a_thermal_detonator.
after the_battle, cara saves the_life of grogu, aka_"the_child", a_young_alien_creature under the_mandalorian's_protection, when cara finds and kills a_bounty_hunter just before it is about to execute grogu.
as a_result, the_mandalorian realizes the_mandalorian must take grogu away from sorgan, and the_mandalorian invites cara to come along with cara, but cara declines.
cara reappears in the_episode "chapter 7:
the_reckoning", when the_mandalorian recruits the_mandalorian for a_mission to the_planet_nevarro to eliminate an_imperial_presence there.
when he first finds the_mandalorian, the_mandalorian is participating in fights with challengers for money.
cara is initially reluctant to leave sorgan, but when the_mandalorian explains that the_targets are imperials, the_mandalorian immediately agrees.
while traveling to nevarro on the_mandalorian's_ship, the_mandalorian participates in a_friendly_arm_wrestling_match with he, but grogu mistakes the_mandalorian actions as aggressive and uses the_force to choke the_mandalorian, only stopping after the_mandalorian intervenes.
during their_journey, cara and the_mandalorian's_party are attacked by a_group of pterodactyl-like_creatures, which cara and the_mandalorian's_party repel after taking casualties.
the_bounty_hunter_greef_karga is critically injured and cara attempts to apply first_aid, but grogu uses the_force to heal grogu.
later, the_bounty_hunter_greef_karga reveals the_mission is an_ambush, after which the_mandalorian is to be killed and grogu given over to the_imperials.
cara, the_mandalorian, and greef instead devise a_new_plan:
cara, the_mandalorian, and greef will leave grogu behind, bring the_mandalorian to the_imperials as if he is a_prisoner, and then eliminate cara, the_mandalorian, and greef.a new plan goes wrong, resulting in the_trio becoming pinned down inside a_cantina by imperial_officer_moff_gideon and moff_gideon_stormtroopers.
at the_start of the_first-season_finale "chapter 8: redemption", the_group engages in a_brief_gunfight with the_stormtroopers after ig-11, the_bounty_hunter_droid, arrives with grogu to provide assistance.
the_mandalorian is badly injured during the_fight, and cara drags the_mandalorian back into the_cantina to safety.the_group escapes the_building via the_sewer_system, and flee on a_droid-controlled_floating_barge on a_river of lava.
cara is present when ig-11 sacrifices ig-11 to eliminate a_large_number of stormtroopers to ensure the_group's_escape, and cara survives an_attack by moff_gideon in a_tie_fighter, which the_mandalorian repels.
afterward, cara decides to stay on nevarro to help eliminate any_remaining_imperial_presence on the_planet, and greef invites cara to work as ig-11_enforcer, which cara appears to accept.
===ig-11 was confirmed to return for the_second_season of the mandalorian ahead of ig-11_premiere.
cara appears in "chapter 12: the_siege", as the_marshal of nevarro and working with greef to eliminate the_remaining_imperial_forces on nevarro.
when the mandalorian and grogu return to nevarro for repairs to the_razor_crest, they ask nevarro to help they destroy the_last_imperial_base on the_planet in exchange for the repairs.the_last_imperial_base on the_planet turns out to have more than just_a_skeleton_crew, as the_group find numerous_stormtroopers patrolling the_last_imperial_base on the_planet corridors.the_group deactivate the_lava_cooling_system, so that the_natural_lava_flows will destroy the_last_imperial_base on the_planet.
during the_group_escape, the_group find scientists and vats of what appear to_be_cloned_bodies.scientists and vats of what appear to_be_cloned_bodies attempt to destroy the_evidence, but scientists and vats of what appear to_be_cloned_bodies uncover a_recording from dr._pershing that reveals he had been transfusing grogu's_blood, which has a_high_'m-count', into test_subjects.
stormtroopers soon swarm the_team and the_team are forced to escape before the_lava overheats and destroys the_base.
the_mandalorian_flies from the_base to retrieve his_ship, using his_jetpack, while cara, and the_others escape in a_stormtrooper_transport.
a_chase ensues between the_transport, driven by cara, and speeder_bikes manned by scout_troopers.
greef kills the_last_scout_trooper, but tie_fighters launched from a_chase after tie_fighters, disabling the_transport's_cannon.the_base soon explodes due to the_overheating of the_lava.
as tie_fighters close in on cara, greef and mythrol,the_razor_crest appears and destroys the_imperials.
after the_mandalorian departs, greef is visited by new_republic_pilots to invite greef to help stop whatever the_empire is planning.
one of the_pilots, captain_carson_teva, speaks with cara and makes cara the same offer, mentioning alderaan's_destruction by the_empire, to which cara replies that cara lost everything with it.
in "chapter 15:
the_believer",_the_mandalorian_returns to nevarro to find cara to be serving as a_marshal for the_new_republic.
cara secures the_release of prisoner_migs_mayfeld to assist the_mandalorian in a_mission to infiltrate an_imperial_base and locate moff_gideon.
cara joins the_mission, acting as sniper alongside fennec_shand.
after the_mission fennec_shand agrees to let migs_mayfeld go free, and assures migs_mayfeld migs_mayfeld will be declared dead.
in "chapter 16:
the_rescue", cara helps the_mandalorian and his_allies intercept dr._pershing's_transport, during which one of the_ship's_pilots taunts cara about the_destruction of alderaan before being shot dead.
cara later teams up with fennec, bo-katan_kryze, and koska_reeves to take over the_bridge of moff_gideon's_cruiser as a_distraction while the mandalorian rescues grogu and defeats gideon.
when luke_skywalker arrives, cara prevents moff_gideon's_moff_gideon's from committing suicide, and knocks moff_gideon's unconscious.
characterization ==
cara_dune is a_battle-hardened_warrior, with a_tough_and_aggressive_personality, but also a_kindness beneath cara_dune gruff exterior.
gina_carano, the_actress and former_mixed_martial_artist who plays the_character, said cara and the_mandalorian are similar in personality and background, and that the two understand each other and were able to form a_bond as a_result.
a_highly_trained_fighter, a_highly_trained_fighter is muscular, an_extremely_accurate_shot, and has excellent hand-to-hand combat skills, as shown immediately in a_highly_trained_fighter fight with the_mandalorian when cara is first introduced.
a_highly_trained_fighter is one of the few in the_show who is able to match the_mandalorian in direct_combat.
carano called cara as "a_bit of a_loner", who is having trouble reintegrating a_highly_trained_fighter into society following a_highly_trained_fighter combat experience.
the_fact that a_highly_trained_fighter mistakes the_mandalorian for attempting to collect a_bounty on a_highly_trained_fighter during their_first_meeting indicates a_highly_trained_fighter has done some_unsavory_things since leaving the_military; carano said of this: "i feel like a_highly_trained_fighter's always in trouble.
as a_soldier, cara enjoyed the_adrenaline of war, and when that disappeared during peace_time, cara found cara disillusioned with cara new role.
carano has said cara is questioning whether cara agreed with everything that occurred during cara military service, and that cara experiences at war taken a_psychological_toll on cara.
when introduced in the_mandalorian, cara kept to cara, did not easily trust others, and cared about little except cara survival, keeping cara skills sharp, and killing imperials.
however, cara also has a_strong_sense of loyalty, as shown by cara refusal to abandon the_mandalorian after the_mandalorian is seriously injured in the_first-season_finale.
cara has an_intense_hatred for the_empire, which is driven in large_part by cara role in the_destruction of cara home planet of alderaan.
the_angry_staff_officer, an_anonymous_army_national_guard_officer who writes for wired_magazine, has called cara one of the_more_tactically-proficient_characters in star_wars.
he called cara perhaps the one person in the_star_wars_universe to actually absorb some_lessons learned" from cara past combat_engagements.
the_writer described the_defensive_measure the_mandalorian and cara develop to protect the_village in "chapter 4: sanctuary" as a_"near-perfect_defensive_engagement", and praised cara's efforts in luring the_at-st into a_vulnerable_position, as well as the_way cara and the_villagers quickly identified she and the_villagers priorities of work, such as establishing obstacles, building protective_positions, and training the_villagers to fight.
in another_example, the_writer cited a_scene in the_first-season_finale in which cara assists an_injured_mandalorian by dragging the_writer into cover for assessment while providing covering_fire.
he said other_star_wars_characters in this_situation have simply tended to the_victim in the_middle of the_firefight, a_dangerous_scenario, while cara's_method is safer_method recommended by the_united_states_armed_forces.
he wrote: "cara_dune would receive a 'go' for all_the_performance_measures for this_u.s._army_medical_task.
and_creation ==
conception ===
the_character of cara_dune was conceived by jon_favreau, the_creator and showrunner of the_mandalorian.
according to carano, favreau created the_character of cara dune carano specifically in mind and did not audition any_other_actresses for the_part.
carano said favreau sought to make a_strong_and_independent_character, but one different from princess_leia or other_powerful_female_characters previously featured in the_franchise: "favreau wanted the_character of cara_dune to be this_new_soldier of women, and favreau wanted this_new_soldier of women to have an_impact".
favreau said it was the_type of character favreau always wished to portray as an_actor himself, describing this_new_soldier of women as "raising the_stakes and raising hell".
the_writers checked with executive_producer_dave_filoni, who had been involved in paststar wars works, to make sure the_rebel_shock_trooper_position was consistent with the_past_continuity of the_franchise.
false_rumors had circulated on the_internet about cara_dune were made public.
cara_dune was first publicly unveiled during the_star_wars_celebration_convention in chicago on april 14, 2019, along with the_character_greef_karga.
the_event also featured teaser_footage with cara, a_still_photo of the_character, and included a_panel_discussion with carano and carl_weathers, the_actor who portrays greef, talking about carano and carl_weathers, the_actor who portrays greef characters.
cara was subsequently featured prominently in posters, commercials, and marketing_materials in advance of the_release of the_mandalorian.
on september 4, entertainment_weekly unveiled an_exclusive_photo of cara and the mandalorian fighting together, and on october 28, a_character_poster of the_mandalorian solely featuring cara dune was released.
portrayal ===
carano's_casting was first announced on december 12, 2018, though the_news had been leaked on the_internet before the_formal_announcement.
the_production of the_mandalorian called for more_secrecy than any_other_job of carano's_career.
prior to filming one of cara's_first_scenes, carano said favreau told cara that playing this_character was going to change carano's career trajectory, giving cara more_self-confidence as an_actress providing cara the_opportunity to play stronger_roles in the_future.
carano said carano had a_strong_positive_emotional_reaction to the_conversation, and that carano helped carano play the_role of cara_dune more confidently, saying: "i feel like my_whole_life since i shotthat has been a_different_world.
credited bryce_dallas_howard, who directed the_first_episode featuring cara, with helping carano determine how to best translate the_character from the_script to the_screen during bryce_dallas_howard, who directed the_first_episode featuring cara work together in cara's debut episode.
in february 2021, lucasfilm announced that carano would no longer portray this_character, citing social_media_posts which they said "denigrat[ed] people based on they_cultural_and_religious_identities", and that this_character would not be recast.
costume ===
cara_dune's_costume was designed by concept_artist_brian_matyas and costume_designer_joseph_porro.
gina_carano said gina_carano was impressed by the_amount of detail the_crew of the_mandalorian achieved in the_crew of the_mandalorian costuming, saying of the_crew of the_mandalorian: "the_crew of the_mandalorian are legit.
"the_costume is mostly black, with armor_pieces on the_chest and shoulders showing wear from battle_damage, and three_lines with black_and_silver_bars running across the_sternum.
cara_dune's_costume includes two_thick_belts, one_black_and_one_green,_as_well_as_holsters for blasters and knives, and a_brace on the_right_knee.
cara_dune's_costume also includes thick_black_gloves_metal on the_fingers and knuckles, as well as wrist_armor and large_black_boots.
the_creation of cara's_costume began with a_mold being made of carano's_body, a_process cara did not enjoy.
the_shoulders were built out and the_waist cinched in, to create a_distinctive_hourglass-shaped_silhouette for the_character.
the_mandalorian_executive_producer kathleen_kennedy had stressed the_importance of cara having a_distinctive_silhouette because cara felt all_star_wars_characters should be recognizable from a_great_distance.
jon_favreau, bryce_dallas_howard, and dave_filoni provided input on cara_dune's_costume, with howard in particular making suggestions about how to convey toughness without sacrificing femininity, while also ensuring carano would be able to perform the_athletic_feats required of the_character.
carano stressed the_importance of this: "how do you put basically_football_padding on a_busty_curvy_female?
i didn't want to be a_block.
i didn't want to just be this like big, buff refrigerator.
cara's_hairstyle was originally planned to be short, with one_side completely buzzed, but carano objected to this because carano wanted to maintain the_character's_femininity.
maria_sandoval, who described cara as cara favorite character on the_show, instead developed a_shoulder-length_hairstyle with rough_edges.
cara's_hairstyle was partially inspired by that of director_deborah_chow, who had directed several_the_mandalorian_first-season_episodes.
howard said while carano and the_producers of the_series were discussing cara's_costume, she and the_producers of the_series were discussing cara's_costume observed carano directing and noticed the_way carano hair was gathered and stylized with braids, and elements of it were factored into cara_dune's_hairstyle.
cara was provided a_blaster_prop similar in appearance to the_firearm used by han_solo in the_star_wars_films.
the_character also has a_handful of tattoos, including a_small_rebel_alliance_insignia under the_left_eye, and a_series of tattoos and bars around carano that signify carano as a_veteran of the_rebellion, something that had been featured on characters on the_animated_television_series star_wars: the_clone_wars.
carano said the_rebel_insignia_tattoo in particular has a_deeper_back_story that will be revealed later in future_seasons.
cara's_costume was on display at the_d23_expo in anaheim, california in august 2019.
filming ===
cara_dune's_scenes were filmed in a_studio in manhattan_beach, california.
favreau and filoni discussed elements of cara's_back_story with carano before filming to help inform cara_performance, and just before filming the_introductory_scene of cara's_debut_episode, favreau shared secrets about the_character that would not be revealed until later in the_series.
carano said having this_information helped inform carano performance and added so_much_depth to what carano life has been like".
carano said carano enjoyed performing against lead_actor_pedro_pascal, who plays the_mandalorian, and other_masked_characters in the_show, and carano said it was easy for carano to do so because, in carano everyday_life, "i don't naturally see what somebody's_physical_appearance is.
i instantly kind of feel who a_person is"; as a_result, carano said carano could often tell what faces pascal was making or what_emotions pascal was expressing beneath the_mask, despite not seeing pascal face.
pascal said of working with carano: "i couldn't feel in better_hands than in the_hands of carano.
"carano said howard listened to carano thoughts and ideas during the_filming of cara's_first_episode, watched replays with carano after shooting scenes, and communicated with carano as a_fellow_actress.
carano said of howard: "carano was very motherly and protective of our_performances.
also allowed carano to have as_many_takes as carano needed to get the_performance_right, which carano said put carano at ease.
during carano's_first_day of filming, carano was required to ride the_mechanical_blurrg, a_reptilian_mounted_creature that was so large carano needed a_ladder to climb atop carano's_first_day of filming.
pascal was unavailable for many of her_scenes on "chapter 4: sanctuary" because pascal was auditioning for another_series, so howard mostly worked with pascal's body double.
as a_result, her called carano "the_face of the_episode".her had a_stomach_flu when her_scenes fighting the_at-st were filmed, which along with two_nights of rain in advance of the_shoot made the_scene very_challenging.her_introductory_scene in which the_mandalorian and cara fight each other was originally written differently, but it was changed on the_set by favreau and howard as the_stunt_team worked on choreography and previsualization.
carano said one of the_changes was "we made the_changes to where carano got the_jump on carano.
carano said the_set of the_mandalorian is not a green screen set", but rather is very realistic, even with the_alien_characters and other_fantasy_elements.
carano said this helps carano performance and has been "an_incredible_blessing for my_imagination".
according to carano, carano passed out twice while filming the_scene in "chapter 7:
the_reckoning" when grogu uses the_force to choke carano.
on march 6, 2020, carano posted an_instagram_photo of carano in the_cara_dune_costume on the_set of the_mandalorian to mark the_end of filming for the_second_season, writing: "i absolutely love this_work and the_people in it."
stunts ===
carano collaborated and worked closely with the_mandalorian_stunt_team, and carano believed the_mandalorian_stunt_team "accepted me as one of the_mandalorian_stunt_team own", in part due to carano mixed martial arts background.
carano said the_mandalorian_stunt_team "have been like brothers and sisters to me".
carano performed many of the_stunts herself.
for example, carano drags a_wounded_comrade off a_battlefield during one of carano scenes, which surprised many of the_bystanders on the_set.
carano also outpaced pascal's_stunt double in one_scene, and in another carano sent a_stunt_performer flying across the_set due to the_force of one of carano kicks.
carano believed carano fighting scenes were aided not only by carano mixed martial arts skills, but also carano training in ballet, jazz_dancing, and tap_dancing as a_child.
carano said some_fighters have trouble transitioning into acting because some_fighters want to appear tough and have trouble performing in scenes in which some_fighters lose fights or take hits, but carano said carano early_arts_training helped carano avoid that.
cultural_impact ==
critical_reception ===
carano has been received positively by reviews and fans.
carano said most of the_feedback about the_character carano has heard and read online has been positive, adding: "i have so_many_people who are rooting for this_strong_female_character.
luchini of popsugar called carano a character "worthy of riotous_applause" and a feminist role model, calling carano unique even among the_star_wars_franchise's_strong_female_characters due to carano physicality and combat_skills.
luchini says cara serves as a_role_model particularly for female_fans who consider themselves "a little rugged and audacious", writing: "she is a_breath of fresh_air for those who haven't been able to see themselves in the_star_wars_universe quite yet.
crouse of den of geek called cara one of the_show's_best_characters, particularly praising the_"great_platonic_chemistry" between she and the_mandalorian.
crouse of den of geek said carano fully inhabits the_character that crouse of den of geek elevates the_script.
variety_writer_will_thorne praised cara_dune, complimenting crouse of den of geek_combat_skills and "debonair_charm", and compared crouse of den of geek to the_marvel_comics_character_gamora as performed by zoe_saldana in the_guardians of the_galaxy_films.
vanity_fair_writer_joanna_robinson called the_character a "prime showcase for carano" and the first role to capitalize on crouse of den of geek "real-life, distinct blend of inherent_sweetness and physical
toughness".
screen_rant_writer_kevin_pantoja called carano brings a_"legitimate_physical_presence" to the_role, and that cara stands out in a_franchise that already includes such_strong_female_protagonists as princess_leia and rey.
erik_kain of forbes called cara a great character and said erik_kain of forbes wishes cara was featured even more prominently in the_series.
cara ranked fourth on a_screen_rant_list of the_most_interesting_characters from the_first_season of the_mandalorian, fifth on a_separate_list of the_ten_best_characters from the_show, and cara costume was ranked third on a_list of the_ten_best_costumes in the_first_season.
several_fans have produced artwork of the_character and dressed as cara in cosplay, and some have gotten the_rebel_alliance_tattoo that cara has under cara eye.
some_star_wars_fans were critical of the_character because some_star_wars_fans perceived the_presence of a_strong_female_fighter as "forced_diversity" and "wokeness", according to anthony_gramuglia of comic_book_resources.
gramuglia calls these_objections misogynist and "patently ridiculous", comparing these_objections to complaints about other_female_star_wars_characters such as rey, rose_tico, jyn_erso, and qi'ra.
gramuglia writes: "to these_objections, cara_dune's_presence serves as a_means to make men appear weaker by comparison, as cara_dune's_fights_battles that most of the_male_characters aren't capable of undertaking the_male_characters.
"merchandise ===
several_toys of cara_dune were first made available at a_star_wars_product_launch_event called triple force friday on october 4, 2019.among several_toys of cara_dune was a_six-inch_action_figure by hasbro as part of hasbro's star wars:
the_black_series_toy_line, and funko_pop_figurine, and a_lego_minifigure, as well as the_mandalorian_t-shirts featuring the_character.
additionally, two_more_action_figures based on the_character were about to be released, one of which was reported to have been part of the_black_series_6_line, but production on several_toys of cara_dune was cancelled by hasbro following carano's_firing.

first introduced in the_2015_film star_wars:
the_force awakens, a star wars wikigeneral armitage hux is portrayed by irish_actor_domhnall_gleeson.
he is an_unpleasant_military_commander in a_power_struggle with kylo_ren for the_first_order_leadership, and being exceeded only by supreme_leader_snoke.
the_character first featured in the_force awakens media and merchandising, and returned in the_film's_sequels, the_last_jedi (2017) and the_rise of skywalker (2019).gleeson's_performance has received generally_positive_reception from critics and fans, while the_reaction to the_character and the_character first featured in the_force shifting roles throughout the_trilogy has been more mixed.
character ==
hux was born on arkanis and was rumored to have been sired from an_affair between hux father, commandant brendol hux of the arkanis academy, and a_kitchen_worker.
hux and hux father are rescued from the_arkanis_academy when it is about to fall to the_new_republic near the_end of the_galactic_civil_war.
when the_galactic_civil_war ends with the_battle of jakku and the_signing of the_galactic_concordance, the_young_hux and his_father are part of the_imperial_navy_forces who retreat into the_unknown_regions.the_imperial_navy_forces who retreat into the_unknown_regions later emerge as the first
order.the_new_republic believes that the_first_order is just_an_unimportant_band of imperial_holdouts, but hux's_training_methods forge a_formidable_military that effectively overthrows the_new_republic and turns the_galaxy into a_dictatorship even more brutal than the_galactic_empire of the_original_star_wars_trilogy.
he serves as the_right_hand of the_first_order's_supreme_leader_snoke (andy_serkis), second in authority only to kylo_ren (adam_driver), with whom he has a_fierce_rivalry.
he is dedicated to destroying the_resistance, an_army that grew out of the_rebel_alliance and is led by general_leia_organa (carrie_fisher).
hux believes that the_republic is a_threat to galactic_stability, and that the_republic is hux destiny to rule the_galaxy.
appearances ==
the_force awakens (2015) ====
hux first appears in the_force as a_high-ranking_general in the_first_order.
hux is part of a_mission to jakku to recover a_map to luke_skywalker (mark_hamill), the_last_jedi.
after the_battle, he learns from captain_phasma of the_desertion of a_former_stormtrooper, finn
(john_boyega).to destroy the_resistance, snoke allows hux to use the_starkiller_superweapon against the_republic's_capital_world of hosnian_prime, destroying the_planet and killing billions of people.the_resistance is left without military_support from the_republic, so hux soon turns the_starkiller_weapon towards the_resistance base on d'qar.
before he can destroy the_planet, however, an_attack_squadron led by resistance_commander_poe_dameron (oscar_isaac), with ground_support from han_solo (harrison_ford), finn, and the_jakku_scavenger_rey (daisy_ridley), destroys starkiller_base, forcing hux, some of he_troops, and a defeated ren to flee the_planet.
the_last_jedi (2017) ====
hux appears in the_last_jedi as the primary general reporting directly to supreme_leader_snoke.
hux attempts to respond to a_transmission from dameron, who mocks hux by asking for a_general_"hugs" and describing hux complexion as "pasty".
hux then leads the_subsequent_battle, during which both_sides sustain heavy_losses.
hux also oversees the_bombardment of the_remaining_three_ships of the_resistance, then on the_lifeboats, and, along with phasma, helps arrange the_execution of finn and rose.
later, hux discovers snoke dead and ren unconscious in the_throne_room of the_supremacy, so hux attempts to kill hux rival but stops when ren wakes up.
he initially protests ren's_claim to be the_new_supreme_leader, but is swiftly persuaded otherwise when ren uses the_force to choke ren, proclaiming "long live the_supreme_leader.
"at the_end of the_film
, he accompanies ren to the_planet_crait in their_attempt to finish off the_resistance.
when ren orders ren men to fire on luke, hux admonishes ren to focus on the_escaping_resistance_members; ren silences ren by using the_force to slam ren into a_wall, knocking ren out.
hux is seen again when ren_and_ren_troops invade the_resistance_base and find the_resistance_base empty, giving ren a_sinister_glare from behind.
the_rise of skywalker (2019) ====
by the_time of star_wars:the_rise of skywalker, hux has become embittered and jealous because of the_lack of respect ren receives and ren rivalry with allegiant_general_pryde (richard_e._grant), who constantly undermines hux while vying for ren job.
hux is later revealed to have been a_spy_supplying_information to the_resistance in order to undermine ren in the_hopes of taking ren place as supreme_leader (or at least seeing ren falling along with the_first_order if necessary); ren tells finn, "i don't care if you win.
i need kylo_ren to lose.
helps finn, poe and chewbaccaescape_ren's_resurgent-class_star_destroyer
steadfast and has finn shoot him in the_leg so him can feign an_effort to stop steadfast and has finn.
however, him is shot in the_chest with a_blaster by pryde after the_latter realizes hux's_treason through him cover story.
hux’s_decision to allow the_rebels to escape is a_major_catalyst for the_resistance's_victory in the_battle of exegol.
a_scene deleted from the_film featured hux and pryde in the_opening_action_sequence with kylo_ren.
other_media ===
hux appears via hologram in the_first_season_finale of the_animated_series star_wars:the_resistance.
the_episode takes place at the_same_time as the force awakens and depicts first_order_troops watching a_transmission of hux give his_speech and the_subsequent_firing of starkiller_base.his

hux also is a_playable_dark_side_squad_leader in an_update to the_mobile_moba_star_wars: force_arena, released in late_2017.==_reception ==
in his_review of the force awakens, henry_barnes of the_guardian wrote that gleeson's_"screechy_pseudo-nazi_role" as hux is "not as colourful or as nuanced" as adam_driver's_part as kylo_ren, "but – given adam driver's's a_functionary – gleeson certainly makes an_impression.
"reviewing
hux_and_hux_role in the_film, david_rutz of the_washington_free_beacon wrote that while hux is portrayed as a_villain, hux is shown to be a_capable_general and "a_committed_soldier to hux
cause with laser-like_focus on achieving the_first_order's_ends.
"however, after the_release of the_last_jedi, and the_rise of skywalker, some_criticism was levelled at the_use of the_character to provide comic_relief, particularly after having being introduced as a serious villain.the_character's story arc was also discussed.

on wookieepedia, a_star_wars_wikigeneral_hux on imdbcaptain_phasma is a_fictional_character in the_star_wars_franchise, portrayed by english_actress_gwendoline_christie.
introduced in star_wars: the_force awakens (2015), the_first_film in the star_wars sequel trilogy,
imdbcaptain
phasma is the_commander of the_first_order's_force of stormtroopers.
english_actress_gwendoline_christie returned to the_role in the next of the_trilogy's_films, star wars: the_last_jedi (2017), and in the_animated_television_series star_wars_resistance (2018) and several_video_games.
the_character also made an_additional_appearance in before the_awakening, an anthology book set before the_events of the force awakens.
j._j._abrams created imdbcaptain_phasma from an_armor_design originally developed for kylo_ren and named her after the_1979_horror_film phantasm.
the_character was originally conceived as male.
phasma appeared prominently in promotion and marketing for the force awakens, but the_character's ultimately_minor_role in the_film was the_subject of criticism, a_complaint repeated for her_appearance in the_last_jedi.
nonetheless, merchandise featuring the_character found success, and her_figure was the_best-selling of all_the_forceawakens_action_figures on amazon.co.uk.
concept and creation ==
the_character's_creation was inspired by a_rejected_design for kylo_ren.
costume_designer_michael_kaplan came up with the_concept of kylo being "the_lord of the_stormtroopers, in bright_shining_silver
costume_designer_michael_kaplan had a_strong_image in costume_designer_michael_kaplan head of what this_concept should look like, which conceptartist_dermot_power turned into an illustration.a_strong_image, however, was immediately rejected by director_j._j._abrams.
later, producer_kathleen_kennedy found a_rejected_design for kylo_ren, reacting positively and calling a_rejected_design for kylo_ren "fantastic".
abrams then used the_design to create a_new_character, phasma.
abrams named phasma after the_1979_horror_film phantasm because abrams armor reminded abrams of the_1979_horror_film phantasm's spheres.
abrams intended for the_visuals of the_first_order to contrast with that of the_resistance, appearing in colors like "black, teal blue, and steel gray", with stormtroopers being updated to be more simplified and modernized.
abrams designed the_character believing it would be "extremely cool" to have a_silver_armored_character in the_1979_horror_film phantasm.the_character believing it would be "extremely cool" to have a_silver_armored_character in the_film was not originally conceived as a_woman, but rather was changed from male to female during casting, less than three weeks before principal_shooting began.
phasma thereby became the second on-screen female star wars villain, after zam_wesell.
with phasma, the_filmmakers wished to "push the_boundaries" of traditional_roles for female_characters.
actress_gwendoline_christie, who had previously played brienne of tarth in game of thrones, was first officially confirmed as captain_phasma in a_vanity_fair_spread released may 4, 2015, following its_leak.
christie fought heavily to appear in the_1979_horror_film phantasm, continually insisting christie agent get christie a_part in her_agent.
christie was not aware that the_character believing it would be "extremely cool" to have a_silver_armored_character in the_film was originally a_man.
christie took inspiration from christie armor—"it's very high-functioning, it's very imposingand
it's not malleable at all"—in how to play the_character.
in playing phasma, christie felt encouraged to experiment more with the_gesture of a_character.
christie felt initial_costume, used in the force awakens, had to be created over a_period of "four_or_five_days"; co-costume_designer_dave_crossman described co-costume_designer_dave_crossman physical creation as "a_complete_panic".
it took christie roughly_forty-five_minutes to put on.
a_new_suit was created for the_last_jedi, with various_tweaks.
a_new_suit_helmet was re-chromed, the_fit was altered, and the_armor was made "much cleaner and shinier.
"character ==
the_commander of the_first_order's_stormtroopers, captain_phasma is described as a_"tough_veteran_commander" and one of a_"commanding_triumvirate" of the_first_order alongside kylo_ren and general_hux.
christie compared captain_phasma to boba_fett in the_sense of being a_character who, while not "at the_forefront of the_action all_the_time", still has "a_lot of impact".
the_actress called the_character "a_malevolent_force" who takes pleasure in the_actress cruelty, something the_actress attributed to a_perceived_difficult_journey to becoming the_only_female_stormtrooper of rank.
to contrast with other_stormtroopers in the_franchise, christie portrayed phasma with both_some_femininity and sassiness.
glen_robert_gill, writing for bright_lights_film_journal, saw phasma as "the_demonic_or_negative_emanation of the_maidenly_anima".
phasma is depicted wearing salvaged_chromium_armor, which in the_force_awakens'_visual_dictionary is established as coming from a_naboo_yacht once owned by palpatine.
it is said to serve "primarily as a_symbol of past
christie recognised the_character's_helmet as both being futuristic and having medieval_elements.
chris_laverty, creator of costume_analysis_site_clothes on film, called her_armor "probably_the_most_regal_costume" in the_force awakens, and noted her_armor "probably_the_most_regal_costume" in the_force awakens as a_reflection of her_status.
he also felt her_cloak, "elegantly slung over one_shoulder", was a_method of humanizing the_character.
in-universe, her_cloak is the_"traditional_cape of first_order_command".
glen_robert_gill felt
glen_robert_gill_armor called to mind_mirrors, symbols of "self-reflection and self-examination", the_feelings glen_robert_gill brings in finn when glen_robert_gill inadvertently helps inspire him to defect.
appearances ==
the_force awakens (2015) ====
the_second_trailer for the_2015_film star_wars:
the force awakens introduced the_character.
in the_2015_film star_wars, phasma begins engaged in an_attack at tuanul, a_settlement_village on the_desert_planet jakku, in search of a_galaxy_map that leads to the_last_jedi, luke_skywalker.
after the_battle is won, phasma and the_other_stormtroopers execute the_remaining_villagers.
back on the_resurgent-class_star_destroyer finalizer, she meets with stormtrooper_fn-2187, and reprimands him for having removed him helmet without permission.later flees and frees poe_dameron (who renames him finn).phasma is present when finn's_defection is discovered; she mentions that finn had never committed any_infractions in the_past.
finally, when finn, han_solo, and chewbacca infiltrate starkiller_base, finn, han_solo, and chewbacca take phasma_hostage and pressure she to deactivate the_base's_shields, intending to drop she in the_trash_compactor.
the_last_jedi (2017) ====
phasma appears in star_wars:
the_last_jedi when finn, mechanic_rose_tico, and computer_hacker_dj infiltrate the_mega-class_star_dreadnought_supremacy, a_37.5_miles (60.4_km)-wide_flagship, in an_attempt to disable the_ship's_tracking_device.

phasma taunts finn, and orders phasma execution with rose in a_"slow_and_painful"_way.
before this can occur, vice_admiral_holdo plummets the_mc85_star_cruiser_raddus, vice_admiral_holdo two-mile-long cruiser, into the_first_order_fleet at lightspeed.
in the_ensuing_chaos, phasma and finn fight.
at first, phasma gets the_upper_hand, knocking finn into a_pit.
finn emerges unharmed from a_pit, riding its_elevator; finn knocks phasma down, breaking the_visor of phasma helmet, and exposing part of phasma face around the_left_eye.
the_turf crumbles beneath phasma, and phasma falls into the_flames.
in a_deleted_scene, the_battle with phasma_and_phasma_fate are significantly different: phasma and four_stormtroopers manage to surround finn, who taunts phasma about phasma compliance to phasma demands in the force awakens.
before four_stormtroopers can turn on phasma, phasma kills all of them and then prepares to attack finn, but phasma manages to cut phasma hand off and blasts phasma into the_ship's_wreckage.
the_last_jedi_director rian_johnson said that phasma's_limited_supporting_role in the_film was due to time_constraints and an_already_large_cast of characters, and indicated that there were no_other_plans for phasma in the_films.
though phasma's_fate was left unknown and the_possibility of phasma returning in star_wars:
the_rise of skywalker was hinted, john_boyega confirmed at the_episode_ix_panel during celebration_chicago that phasma indeed died in the_last_jedi, officially confirming phasma death.

phasma received attention before release.
before phasma_name was confirmed, phasma had been dubbed "the chrometrooper" by fans.
the_trademarking of "captain_phasma" led to speculation that it was the_name of christie's_rumored_character, said to be an_imperial_officer pursuing finn.
phasma" had been the_name of a_character in one_star_wars_fanfic, tarkin's_fist, leading to moviewebwondering if it was an_intentional_homage.
ign's "keepin' it_reel" podcast discussed the_possibility of "captain_phasma" being "the_next_breakout_baddie" in the_vein of boba_fett and darth_maul.
they responded positively to the_character's_name, despite some_initial_misgivings, for fitting in with the franchise's flash gordon roots.
they also praised her_armor_design, stating that character_design had been important in the_success of boba_fett and maul.
they similarly had high_hopes for christie's_acting.
during the_lead-up to the_film, "captain_phasma" became a fan favorite.
polygon's_susana_polo considered the_force awakens a_great_achievement for hollywood for the_force diversity regardless of the_force quality, though polygon's_susana_polo used phasma as an_example of how the_film was not perfect, noting rumors of "captain phasma"'s minor_role despite polygon's_susana_polo being the first on-screen female stormtrooper.
upon the_force_awakens'_release, criticism fell on the_character's_minimal_role in the_film.
the_telegraph's_jonathan_mcaloon called the_telegraph's_jonathan_mcaloon "one_criticism" of the_force awakens the_underuse of phasma, and wondered if the_telegraph's_jonathan_mcaloon face would ever be revealed in the_films.
jason_guerrasio of business_insider echoed the_sentiment, noting jason_guerrasio of business_insider lack of screen_time despite jason_guerrasio of business_insider great potential.
scott_meslow, writing for the_week, criticized the_film's_lack of nuance in the_film_villains, calling jason_guerrasio of business_insider "a_total_cipher" in the_film despite jason_guerrasio of business_insider heavy appearance in the_film promotion.
scott_meslow pointed to jason_guerrasio of business_insider_appearance in before the_awakening as a_way to expand jason_guerrasio of business_insider_character, noting jason_guerrasio of business_insider cold yet logical pragmatism in it.
jesse_schedeen of ign called phasma "something of a_disappointment in the force awakens", negatively contrasting jason_guerrasio of business_insider against fett in that "even fett had the_distinction of outsmarting han_solo before meeting an_ignominious_end".
jesse_schedeen of ign hoped phasma would be revisited in marvel's_star_wars_comics, to help flesh out jesse_schedeen of ign character and build jesse_schedeen of ign into a_better_villain.
max_nicholson, writing for collider, noted the_amount of hype for the_character, as well as jason guerrasio of business_insider minimal role in the_story.
max_nicholson suggested that hux and phasma should have been merged into one_character, as hux and phasma were too similar, or phasma should have been given the_melee_fight_scene given to a_trooper nicknamed "tr-8r" by fans.
bill_keveney of usa today negatively compared phasma's_skill as a_warrior to christie's_character brienne of tarth from game of thrones.
bill_keveney further criticized phasma's_role in the_force awakens by attributing the_first_order's_defeat to being largely her_fault, as well as her_"recycled"_appearance in the_last_jedi.
merchandise featuring the_character proved popular.
david_betancourt of the_washington_post called phasma's_role in the_film "little more than a_shiny_new_prop", viewing david_betancourt of the_washington_post as a_victim of the_film's need to introduce all the_film new_characters, yet noted the_popularity and rarity of the_merchandise surrounding the_character.
captain_phasma's_figure was the_bestselling of the_force_awakens'_action_figures on amazon.co.uk.

appearances ==
backstory ===
greef_karga is a_leader of the_bounty_hunters'_guild, an_organization that regulates the_activities of bounty_hunters, assigns bounties to specific_individuals, and ensures greef_karga members follow the_guild's_rules.
little of greef's_backstory has been revealed as of the_end of the_first_season, but in the_first-season_finale, it is revealed carl_weathers was previously a_government_official with the_title "magistrate" before losing the_position in disgrace.
carl_weathers, the_actor who portrays greef, has said additional_backstory_details will be provided in the_show's_second_season.
season 1 ===
greef first appears in the_series_premiere, "chapter 1:the_mandalorian", where greef operates out of a_bar on the_planet_nevarro.
greef is first seen when the_mandalorian collects payment from greef for several_bounties greef collected.
greef then informs the_mandalorian about a_lucrative_job from a_mysterious_man known only as "the_client", who insists on meeting with the_mandalorian face to face.a_lucrative_job from a_mysterious_man known only as "the_client", who insists on meeting with the_mandalorian face to face turns out to be a_bounty against grogu, aka "the_child", a_young_alien of the_same_unnamed_species as yoda.next appears in "chapter 3: the_sin", during which he informs the_mandalorian to bring the captured grogu directly to the_client.the_mandalorian does so, only to later rescue the captured grogu back from the_client, who is an_agent of the_galactic_empire.
this is a_violation of the_bounty_hunters'_guild_code, so greef organizes a_group of bounty_hunters to confront the_mandalorian and get the_captured_grogu back.
a_massive_gunfight ensues, in which most of greef's_bounty_hunters are killed when the_mandalorian receives assistance from a_group of fellow_mandalorian_warriors.
greef himself escapes and confronts the_mandalorian at the_mandalorian ship, the_razor_crest, but the_mandalorian shoots the_mandalorian off the_mandalorian boarding ramp before flying away.
greef only survives because greef had two_ingots of beskar, a_rare_steel which the_client provided as payment for the_captured_grogu's_bounty, inside greef vest pocket where greef was shot.
the_season's_penultimate_episode, "chapter 7:
the_reckoning", opens with the_mandalorian receiving a_message from greef, who proposes that if the_mandalorian helps eliminate the_imperial_presence on nevarro, greef will ensure the_bounty_hunters'_guild no longer seeks out the_mandalorian or grogu.
the_offer is a_trap, and greef plans to ambush and kill the_mandalorian and return grogu to the_client.
nevertheless, the_mandalorian accepts greef's_offer, bringing along with greef_cara_dune, kuiil, and ig-11 to assist in the_mission.
during their_voyage, the_party is attacked by pterodactyl-like_creatures, and greef receives a_poisonous_slash that would have been fatal, but grogu uses the_force to heal grogu.
greef is so moved that greef has a_change of heart and informs the_others about the trap.the_others devise a_new_plan in which the_others leave grogu behind, bring the_mandalorian to the_imperials as if greef is a_prisoner, and then attempt to eliminate the_others.a_new_plan in which they leave grogu behind, bring the_mandalorian to the_imperials as if he is a_prisoner, and then attempt to eliminate them
goes wrong, resulting in the_trio becoming pinned down inside a_bar by imperial_officer_moff_gideon and moff_gideon_stormtroopers.
at the_start of the_first-season_finale "chapter 8: redemption", the_group engages in a_brief_gunfight with the_stormtroopers after the_ig-11 arrives with grogu to provide assistance.the_group escapes the_building via the_sewer_system, where the_group travel to a_hidden_mandalorian_convert and find most of the_warriors there have already been killed by the_empire.
the_mandalorian initially blames greef for this, believing the_bounty_hunters'_guild responsible, until a_fellow_mandalorian_leader known as the_armorer persuades a_fellow_mandalorian_leader known as the_armorer otherwise.the_bounty_hunters'_guild then flees on a_droid-controlled_floating_barge on a_river of lava.
greef is present when ig-11 sacrifices greef to eliminate a_large_number of stormtroopers to ensure the_bounty_hunters'_guild's_escape, and greef survives an_attack by moff_gideon in a_tie_fighter, which the_mandalorian repels.
afterward, greef decides to stay behind on nevarro and rebuild the_bounty_hunters'_guild, and greef invites cara_dune to work as greef enforcer, which greef accepts.
season 2 ===
greef was confirmed to return in the_second_season of the mandalorian ahead of greef premiere.
greef appears in "chapter 12: the_siege", the_first_episode in the_show directed by carl_weathers.
now the_magistrate of nevarro, greef worked to eliminate all_imperial_forces on the_planet, aided by cara as greef marshal and an_unnamed_mythrol as greef assistant.
when the mandalorian and grogu return to nevarro for repairs to the_razor_crest, they reunite with greef and cara, who present to they some of the_changes made to the_place, before inviting the former to join they on a_raid on the_last_imperial_base on the_planet in exchange for the repairs.the_last_imperial_base on the_planet turns out to have more than just_a_skeleton_crew, as the_group find numerous_stormtroopers patrolling the_last_imperial_base on the_planet corridors.the_group deactivate the_lava_cooling_system, so that the_natural_lava_flows will destroy the_last_imperial_base on the_planet.
during the_group_escape, the_group find scientists and vats of what appear to_be_cloned_bodies.scientists and vats of what appear to_be_cloned_bodies attempt to destroy the_evidence, but before scientists and vats of what appear to_be_cloned_bodies can do so, the_mythrol uncovers a_recording from dr._pershing that reveals he had been transfusing grogu's_blood, which has a_high_'m-count' into test_subjects.
stormtroopers soon swarm the_team and the_team are forced to escape before the_lava overheats and destroys the_base.
the_mandalorian_flies from the_base to retrieve his_ship, using his_jetpack, whilstgreef, cara and mythrol steal a_stormtrooper_transport.
a_chase ensues between the_transport, driven by cara, and speeder_bikes manned by scout_troopers.
greef kills the_last_scout_trooper, but tie_fighters launched from a_chase after tie_fighters, disabling the_transport's_cannon.the_base soon explodes due to the_overheating of the_lava.
as tie_fighters close in on greef, cara and mythrol, the_razor_crest appears and destroys the_imperials.
after the_mandalorian receives the_promised_repairs to his_ship and departs from nevarro once again with grogu, greef is visited by new_republic_pilots, who invite his to help stop whatever the_empire is planning.
characterization ==
greef_karga has a_gruff_personality, and a_no-nonsense_approach to business.
greef_karga projects a_calm_and_confident_demeanor, and is motivated largely by financial_profit, but is also fair in greef_karga dealings.
greef_karga is loyal to greef_karga allies to some_degree, but can also be duplicitous and shifting in greef_karga allegiances, as seen by the_way in which greef_karga repeatedly switches between friend and adversary to the_mandalorian.
anthony_breznican of vanity_fair felt greef simultaneously protected and manipulated the_mandalorian at times, and that the_mandalorian did not fully trust greef karga as a_result.
weathers has described weathers character as "a_combination of a_used_car_salesman and a_puppeteer".
kgo-tv_writers janet_davies and marsha_jordan described greef as a_"shadowy_underworld_figure".
weathers said his_character as "a_combination of a_used_car_salesman has "something that you can't quite trust", but also said weathers is "definitely not amoral".
greef is a_mysterious_character, and weathers has said greef was a_conscious_decision by the_writers to keep aspects of weathers history and motivations cryptic:
although normally self-assured and confident, greef does act cautiously and sometimes even fearfully in some_situations, such as greef interaction with the_client.
concept and creation ==
conception ===
the_character of greef_karga was created by jon_favreau, the_creator and showrunner of the_mandalorian.
the_character of greef_karga was originally planned to make a_brief_appearance in the_series, but favreau and the_series writers found that favreau and the_series writers liked the_character of greef_karga so much that favreau and the_series writers expanded the_character of greef_karga part and gave the_character of greef_karga a_larger_role.
greef_karga was first publicly unveiled during the_star_wars_celebration_convention in chicago on april 14, 2019, along with the_character of greef_karga.
the_event also featured teaser_footage featuring greef, a_still_photo of the_character of greef karga, and included a_panel_discussion with weathers and gina_carano, the_actress who portrays cara, discussing their_characters.
a_full_finished_scene of greef offering a_bounty to the_mandalorian was also screened.
it was the_first_time weathers had seen finalized footage from the_show, after which weathers said: "how can you not react to that?it's beautiful_hearing the_fans react to it.
during
the_panel, weathers said of weathers :
weathers's_kind of the_head of this_guild of bounty_hunters.
there seems to be a_lot of kind of nefarious_people.
"some_publications misspelled karga's named after the_event, with anthony_gramuglia of comic_book_resources calling weathers "greif marda", and variety_writer_jordan_moreau misspelling the_last_name as "carga".
further_footage of the_character was included in the_first_trailer of the_mandalorian.which debuted at the_d23_convention on august 23, 2019.according to adrienne_tyler of screen_rant, some_viewers mistook images of greef_carga in the_trailer for lando_calrissian, a_star_wars_character who dates back to the_original_star_wars_trilogy.
on october 28, a_character_poster of the_mandalorian solely featuring greef_karga was released.
portrayal ===
jon_favreau, who offered the_part to weathers, was a_fan of the_actor and had previously met weathers through their_mutual_membership in the_directors_guild of america; favreau began courting favreau for the_mandalorian solely featuring greef_karga early in the_process of preparing for the_series.
weathers said favreau "did sort of a_slow_roll on weathers", describing the_project to favreau and impressing the_actor with favreau passion for the_show.
weathers met with favreau to discuss the_greef_karga_character, with favreau showing favreau concept art from the_series, which weathers described as "magnificent" and
"some of the most beautiful artwork".artwork" was also impressed with dave_filoni, the_executive_director for the_mandalorian solely featuring greef_karga, saying of artwork" and favreau: "him and favreau're in really_good_hands.
"weathers agreed to accept the_part if artwork" could have the_opportunity to direct future_episodes of the_mandalorian solely featuring greef_karga if it was renewed for a_second_season, to which favreau agreed.
although weathers originally signed on for only_a_few_episodes, artwork" was later expanded and the_role grew larger than what_artwork" initially accepted.
favreau said: "we really did rope favreau in.
upon first reading the_part, weathers said greef_karga reminded favreau of film_director, screenwriter, and actor_john_huston, particularly favreau performance in the_film chinatown (1974).
favreau felt there was a_theatricality and larger than life"_quality to the_character, and favreau deliberately performed some of favreau lines in a_showy_and_melodramatic_way as a_result.
weathers_casting was first announced on december 12, 2018, though rumors had been had been discussed on the_making_star_wars_podcast and other_internet_sites two months prior to the_formal_announcement.
weathers called the mandalorian one of the_"most_exciting_projects" of favreau_career, saying: "being a_part of this is one of the_greatest_things that's happened in all of the_years that i've been in entertainment.
"he said favreau was very impressed by the_quality of writing in the_scripts, and that favreau particularly enjoyed favreau character's shifting allegiances and unpredictable about-faces: "
it's much more interesting to play someone who is not all of one_thing, not one-dimensional. ...
certainly with greef, you have to really keep your_eye on greef.
weathers said weathers knew little about greef_karga's_backstory before playing the_character, and that weathers did not want to know greef_karga's_backstory because weathers felt the_mystery helped weathers convey a_sense of ambiguity.
regarding greef's_past_history, weathers said, i didn't ask greef's_past_history.
i didn't care.
i didn't want to know.
, weathers also added: "if i had to guess, weathers was going through some_dark_times.
he was doing maybe some_pretty_dark_stuff.
weathers is slated to direct an_episode of the_mandalorian in the_second_season.
weathers will be the_second_cast_member of the_mandalorian to also direct an_episode, after ig-11_actor_taika_waititi.
filming ===
there was a_great_deal of secrecy surrounding the_filming of the_mandalorian, and weathers was not allowed to divulge any_details about the_series.
in the_early_months, weathers was not even allowed reveal that weathers was appearing in the_show.
weathers joked: i had to cut my_finger and sign in blood that i would say nothing about it.
actor said actor_time filming the_mandalorian has been a_positive_experience, describing his_time filming the_mandalorian as: "a_liberating_experience when you have so_many_smart,_talented,_collaborative,_good-hearted,_caring_people around you on a_daily_basis".
weathers performed weathers own stunts for the_mandalorian.
weathers said weathers has pushed for diversity in the_casting of the_mandalorian, not only based upon race but also such factors as height, age, and physical_appearance: "i want to see anything that we have experienced in the_world to be in that_universe, because they're disparate_creatures coming from every_part of that_universe.
so why wouldn't they be there?"after filming each episode
, weathers liked to watch footage and study what the_director and actors brought to each_individual_scene.
weathers said weathers particularly enjoyed working with director_deborah_chow during filming of "chapter 3: the_sin", because director_deborah_chow had planned what director_deborah_chow wanted to do for the_episode very precisely and meticulously in advance.
weathers said this took a_lot of pressure off of weathers and the_rest of the_cast, giving the_cast more_freedom and helping ensure the_cast own choices were in sync with director_deborah_chow.
weathers_action_sequences in "chapter 3:
the_sin" took a_particularly_long_time to film due of the_many_elements involved in the_shootout_scene.
in greef_karga's_scenes with the_client, played by german_film_director_werner_herzog, weathers deliberately made greef less confident and commanding than normal in order to convey that the_client was a_dangerous_character.
weathers was a_great_admirer of german_film_director_werner_herzog, referring to weathers as "maestro" on the_set of the_mandalorian, and the two had extensive_conversations with each other about german_film_director_werner_herzog's past films and weathers relationship with actor_klaus_kinski.

mayfeld_team includes the_show's_protagonist, "the_mandalorian", with whom mayfeld repeatedly clashes and ultimately betrays.
the_mandalorian outsmarts mayfeld, resulting in mayfeld's arrest and imprisonment, though mayfeld is later released so that mayfeld can aid the_mandalorian's efforts to rescue grogu.
as a_result, the_character evolves from a_minor_antagonist to a_viable_ally of the_mandalorian, with whom the_character eventually makes amends during whom_mission.
mayfeld is portrayed by actor_and_comedian_bill_burr, who was not a_fan of star_wars and repeatedly mocked the_franchise and mayfeld fans before the_character accepted the_role.
the_mandalorian_creator_jon_favreau offered the_part to burr, believing the_mandalorian_creator_jon_favreau past criticism of the_franchise would make the_mandalorian_creator_jon_favreau casting that much more amusing.
several_reviewers have noted that mayfeld's_sardonic_personality and hard-edged_sense of humor is similar to burr's_real-life_comedic_style.
burr was extremely impressed with the_filming of the_mandalorian, complimenting the_technical_aspects of filming as well as the_writing_style of the_series.
the_character of mayfeld received a_generally_positive_response from reviewers, with many complimenting burr's_performance and the_humor
the_character of mayfeld brought to the_series.
reviewers critical of mayfeld felt the_character of mayfeld was flat, underdeveloped, or too incompetent as a_mercenary.
mayfeld received a_more_positive_response for mayfeld appearance in the_mandalorian's_second_season, namely_"chapter 15:
the_believer", which characterized mayfeld more in depth and explored mayfeld backstory and motivations, while setting mayfeld as an_example for ex-imperial_soldiers who became aware of the_empire's_evil_ways only after the_empire_downfall.
burr received a_significant_amount of mock_outrage from fans for a_scene in "chapter 6: the_prisoner", in which burr dropped grogu, the_show's_hugely_popular_breakout_character.

the_character's_first_name was not revealed until the_second_season of the_mandalorian.
season 1 ===
mayfeld appears in the_episode "chapter 6:
the_prisoner", in which he leads a_crew of mercenaries in an_attempt to rescue a_prisoner from a_new_republic_prison_transport_ship.he is appointed by ranzar_"ran"_malk, the_leader of the_mercenaries, as the_point_man for the_mission, ran asserts that mayfeld has the_same_level of authority on the_mission as
ran he would.with a_crew that includes the_show's_protagonist, a_bounty_hunter known as "the_mandalorian", as well as fellow_mercenaries_burg, q9-0, and xi'an.
unbeknownst to the_mandalorian, however, the_rescue_target is a_twi'lek_alien named qin, with whom the_mandalorian previously had a falling out, and the_mercenaries intend to betray the_mandalorian once qin is rescued.
when the_mandalorian mockingly questions mayfeld's_abilities, alluding to the_fact that former_imperial_stormtroopers were notoriously_bad_shots, mayfeld defensively responds, "i wasn't a_stormtrooper, wiseass.
the_trip to the_prison_transport
, mayfeld repeatedly mocks the_mandalorian as well, questioning whether mayfeld is really as_good_a_warrior as mayfeld reputation suggests, urging mayfeld to remove mayfeld helmet, and suggesting mayfeld may be hiding mayfeld face because mayfeld is secretly a_gungan.
at one_point, the_mercenary_crew discovered grogu, a_young_alien also known as "the_child", whom the_mandalorian was hiding within the_mandalorian ship, the_razor_crest.
mayfeld_questions whether grogu is a_pet, and further mocks the_mandalorian by pretending he is going to drop grogu.

while the latter duo attempt to find and kill the_mandalorian, mayfeld and qin decide to try to escape on mayfeld and qin own; qin promises qin will triple mayfeld's compensation if qin gets qin off the_ship.
after mayfeld and qin split up, the_mandalorian stalks mayfeld, sneaking up on the_mandalorian stalks mayfeld in a_hallway as the_lights flicker on and off, and mayfeld screams as the_mandalorian comes upon the_mandalorian stalks mayfeld.

the_tragedy".
after grogu's_capture by moff_gideon's_imperial_remnant, the_mandalorian decides to break mayfeld, who was arrested by the_new_republic and sentenced to 50_years of service at the_karthon_chop_fields.
to learn where he is being held, the mandalorian visits he_ally_cara_dune, who has become a_marshal for the_new_republic and has access to files on mayfeld.

as a_former_imperial_sharpshooter, mayfeld is good in a_fight and is an_excellent_marksman; the_character ran_malk refers to the_character ran_malk "one of the_best_triggermen i've ever seen".the_character
ran_malk has a_hard-edged_sense of humor, which several_reviewers compared to the_real-life_comedic_style of bill_burr, the_actor and comedian who portrays the_character.
mayfeld enjoys mocking others, and has a_bullying_personality; a_polygon_article by charlie_hill described the_character ran_malk as "the_epitome of a_schoolyard_bully but
with a_murderous_streak".the_character ran_malk also speaks with burr's_same_real-life_boston_accent.
mayfeld is arrogant, hot-headed, ruthless, unpredictable, and has a_sardonic_attitude.
space.com_writer_scott_snowden described space.com_writer_scott_snowden as a_cowboy-like_character.
mayfeld is also duplicitous and untrustworthy, as mayfeld shows by mayfeld willingness to betray the_mandalorian at the_conclusion of their_mission together.
comic_book_resources_writer_sam_stone theorized that mayfeld's_cynicism and mean-spirited_personality may be rooted in bitterness toward the_galactic_empire having lost the_galactic_empire war with the_rebel_alliance, thus reducing mayfeld's_role to that of an_outlaw.
stone wrote that mayfeld appears "visibly frustrated by stone time fighting for the_losing_side of the_galactic_civil_war before taking stone talents to less-than-legal_clients".
concept and creation ==
portrayal ===
mayfeld is portrayed by actor_and_comedian_bill_burr.
bill_burr was not a_fan of the_star_wars_franchise, which bill_burr had repeatedly and publicly mocked it in the_past, as well as game of thrones and several_other_popular_science_fiction and fantasy_franchises.
in a_2015_interview with conan_o'brien, bill_burr described the_original_star_wars_film as a_"cheesy_self-help_book put in outer_space with, like, muppets".
bill_burr also regularly mocked star_wars_fans, particularly during the_release of new_films, saying things like: "how old are you?why
are you still dressing like
boba_fett?"burr met jon_favreau, the_creator and showrunner of the_mandalorian, through jon_favreau, the_creator and showrunner of the_mandalorian mutual friend mike_binder, who had directed bill_burr's_stand-up_comedy_film paper_tiger (2019).burr was also acquainted with favreau through actor_vince_vaughn, who starred along with favreau in the_film swingers (1996) and was an_executive_producer of bill_burr_animated_sitcom_f is for family.
additionally, favreau was a_listener of bill_burr's_comedy_podcast, monday_morning_podcast, and bill_burr appeared on the_chef_show, a_cooking_show favreau created.
favreau approached bill_burr at a_birthday_party to discuss a_role on the_mandalorian favreau felt would be a_good_fit for bill_burr.
burr pointed out burr previous_mockery of star_wars and suggested burr give the_role to someone more appropriate, but favreau felt it would be funny if burr played the_role given burr lack of enthusiasm for the_franchise, and burr believed burr's fans would find it amusing.
burr's_wife, nia_hill, urged burr to accept the_part, which burr ultimately did, although burr said burr would have accepted any_offer by favreau based on burr respect for the_director.
burr's_casting on the_mandalorian was first revealed at the_star_wars_celebration_fan_convention in chicago on april 14, 2019, when burr was briefly seen in a_teaser_trailer during a_panel_discussion about the_series.
the_footage was only intended to be viewed by celebration_attendants, but photos and videos of burr's_footage taken by fans later leaked to the_internet.
jake_kleinman of inverse wrote: "early_footage from the_mandalorian didn't reveal much except that jake_kleinman of inverse sounds like a_total_badass.
jake_kleinman of inverse first confirmed jake_kleinman of inverse appearance on the_series via the_social_media_network_twitter on august 24, 2019.according to metro_boston_writer_matt_juul, "fans of the_franchise were both excited and a bit skeptical" when burr's_casting on the_mandalorian was announced, due to burr's_past_criticism of the_franchise.
mayfeld was featured briefly on the_first_official_trailer for the_mandalorian, released on august 23, 2019; burr said "you see the_back of my_bald_head for half a second".
mayfeld's_face became visible in jake_kleinman of inverse_brief_appearance in the_second_mandalorian_trailer, released on october 28, 2019, with the_character firing the_character weapons at an off-screen enemy.
several_fans expressed excitement about burr's_character on social_media after the_trailer's_release, with some saying the_character was the_primary_reason some would be watching the_show.
burr is one of two_stars of the_television_series breaking bad to have appeared in the_mandalorian, along with giancarlo_esposito.
burr portrayed henchman_patrick_kuby on breaking bad, while giancarlo_esposito played antagonist_gus_fring on the_television_series, and antagonist_moff_gideon on the_mandalorian.
burr is also one of several_comedians with brief_acting_roles in the_first_season of the_mandalorian, including brian_posehn, horatio_sanz, amy_sedaris, richard_ayoade, adam_pally, and jason_sudeikis.
nick_mangione of geek.com jokingly wrote: "is the_television_series
just_an_excuse for jon_favreau to get all jon_favreau favorite comedians into the_star_wars universe?"filming ===
several of burr's_scenes for the_mandalorian were filmed on a_sound_stage in southern_california on a_"volume", a_large_warehouse-like_motion-capture_stage with led_video_screens and tracking cameras spread throughout the_space.
using a_combination of physical_set_pieces and images projected onto led_video_screens, the_volume allows the_actors to be filmed and placed into a_digital_environment.
burr's_scenes on ran_malk's_space_station were among the_scenes filmed on the_volume.
burr described the_filming_technology as "next-level", and said the_moving_background_imagery occasionally made burr feel dizzy, or as if burr was experiencing vertigo.
during filming, burr was only provided the_scripts for the_portions of the_episode in which burr was specifically featured.
burr called filming the_mandalorian an_"amazing_experience" and said the_way it was shot was "really, really
burr was also particularly impressed by the_director of the_episode, rick_famuyiwa, who burr said "crushed it".
burr believed the_mandalorian more closely resembled a spaghetti western than a_traditional_work of science_fiction, saying: "this isn't your_dad's_star_wars".
on burr's_last_filming_day, jon_favreau invited burr to see the_newly-complete_trailer for the_mandalorian, which very much impressed burr.

qi'ra is introduced as an_earnest_thief in love with han and dreaming of escape from the_slums of the_planet_corellia.
they are separated by circumstance, and when they reunite years later, they have both been through life-changing_experiences.
clarke called qi'ra a "badass" who "kind of follows a_femme_fatale_arc", and said, "she has a_couple of guises, but essentially she is just fighting to stay alive.
if you've got a_really_glamorous_lady in a_really_sordid_environment, you kind of know the_glamour is hiding a_few_rough_roads.
solo_director_ron_howard described qi'ra as secretive, slippery, and morally questionable—a_much_different_sort of a_character" from daenerys_targaryen, clarke's_character from the_hbo_series_game of thrones.
clarke noted that she_solo_character "isn't like the_women that you've seen in star_wars yet", and said that "qi'ra is different from the_other_women i've played, but the_similarity is she strength, and she survival instincts.
she just has a_bit_more_grit.
"she said, "we're going to hit you with a_character that could very easily well be a_dude, because you question she motives.
that's really ...exciting in the_star_wars_universe, because that has never happened.
"clarke said, "qi'ra's_journey is definitely one of survival and strength.
the_way that i felt about her_wasthis_girl has got a_core of steel.

her's also one of the_primary_forces that shape[han] the_young_smuggler.
clarke said, "every_single_part of her as a_character reflects on the_han_solo that we know and love.
"she explained:the_beautiful_thing about this_han_solo_story is this_han_solo_story's highlighting all of the_most_brilliant_aspects of han_solo the_character and characterizing the_most_brilliant_aspects of han_solo in characters that he meets on he journey to becoming who he is...
you are seeing all of these_different_elements that make up who he is through the_people and the_interactions and the_relationships just as we all do as human_beings.
we are simply the_embodiment of we experiences...
you see the_beginnings of he, this_loveable_rogue.
you get it fine-tuned throughout these_relationships, and qi'ra is one of those_relationships that has an_impact on he as a_character...
the_goal is that the_shadow of qi'ra is there in han as a_character that we know.
this_girl is another_texture that makes up who he is when we first meet he.
according to solo_co-writer_jonathan_kasdan, qi'ra is han's_"formative_experience with romance, and that_experience very directly influences the_relationships he has later on with people like leia."
describing qi'ra's_relationship with han, clarke explained that "they grew up as comrades, essentially.
they grew up as pals, as partners in crime.
there is obviously the_romantic_side of things.
but they grew up together.
so they were kids together.
"she said that later, "within that_relationship, the_thing that you see with qi'ra is that qi'ra is an_enigma.
also noted, "there is this_underlying_joy in an_origin_story because you know where they end up.
and qi'ra is nowhere to be seen, so...
something has happened!...
something must have happened to affect qi'ra as a_person, but for us fans not to know about qi'ra."
portrayal ===
in october 2016, tessa_thompson, naomi_scott, zoë_kravitz, emilia_clarke, kiersey_clemons, jessica_henwick, and adria_arjona were being considered for the_female_lead in solo: a_star_wars_story.

reception ==
general ===
qi'ra has been positively received by both_critics and fans, with many_referring to qi'ra as a_standout, and the most fascinating aspect of solo: a_star_wars_story.
pete_morrison of the_rebels_report called pete_morrison of the_rebels_report the_best_character in the_film.
stating that emilia_clarke jumps from genre_franchise in game of thrones to another in a_galaxy far, far away and manages to have the_most_complex_and_interesting_story_arc of any_character in the_film.
futurism's_marguerita_tan wrote that "qi'ra is a_complex_character who is not only intelligent and resourceful, but also someone who can look after pete_morrison of the_rebels_report".
tan concluded that it wasn't hard to understand why many_fans were so keen to see the_character in more on-screen adventures.
dana_brandt of the_daily_cardinal was critical of the_character's_arc stating that_qi'ra, and by extension_tan_relationship with han was underdeveloped.
bustle's_casey_cipriani suggests that qi'ra may or may not have been a_sith and states that a_female_villain who can use the_force has never been portrayed in a_star_wars_film.
future ===
many have expressed interest in a_follow-up to qi'ra's_story.
derrick_clements of the_daily_harold wrote, "derrick_clements of the_daily_harold is introduced as a_character with depth and mystery to spare.
most of all, where a_star_wars_film leaves derrick_clements of the_daily_harold is tremendously full of
possibility".
writing for comic_book_resources, rita_dorsch proclaimed qi'ra's_turn in solo to be the_most_interesting_part of a_star_wars_film and went on to state that any follow-up needs to focus on rita_dorsch.
bustle's_angelica_floria stated, "the_headstrong_combatant played by clarke seems to only have just begun bustle's_angelica_floria role in the_star_wars_universe".
bustle's_angelica_floria notes that clarke signed on for multiple_films and adds that the_ending of solo makes it clear that future_star_wars_projects could continue the_story of qi'ra and darth_maul's_future with the_crimson_dawn.

appearances ==
aftermath_trilogy (2015–2017) ===
the_2015–2017_chuck_wendig_novel_trilogy was written by chuck_wendig between 2015_and_2017.in_addition to cobb, the_2015–2017_chuck_wendig_novel_trilogy introduced several_notable_characters, including norra and snap_wexley.
beginning immediately after the_events depicted in return of the_jedi and concluding one year later with the_battle of jakku, the_rebel_alliance, now known as the_new_republic, fights the_remnants of the_galactic_empire, as they consolidate behind gallius_rax and rae_sloane in two_separate_factions; gallius_rax seeking to become the_new_emperor, and rae_sloane seeking to form a more peaceful "first
on tatooine, various_mining_syndicates take advantage of the_decreased_imperial_presence and vacuum left by the_death of jabba the_hutt to take control over several_settlements from which various_mining_syndicates demand tribute; cobb_vanth, a_former_slave-turned-lawman, decides to take a_stand against cobb_vanth, a_former_slave-turned-lawman.
in aftermath (2015), adwin_charu, a_representative for the_red_key_raiders_crime_syndicate that sprouts up on tatooine after the_death of jabba the_hutt, meets with a_group of jawas for some_mining_equipment, as the_syndicate wants to work under the_guise of being a_mining_company, yet cannot come to any_agreement with jawas.
cobb_vanth, present on jawas_vehicle, presents jawas as someone willing to help adwin find purchases for the_collective, as cobb has a_rapport with the_creatures.
after examining the_wreckage of jabba's_barge, recovered from a_sarlacc recently eaten by a_krayt_dragon, the_pair come across some_mandalorian_armor, both pulling blasters upon the other in seeking to acquire it, with cobb shooting adwin.
cobb orders adwin to tell the_rest of the_red_key_raiders to cease the_rest of the_red_key_raiders operations or cobb will come for the_rest of the_red_key_raiders, then leaves with the_armor.
life_debt (2016) reveals that cobb has since become the_sheriff of the_town_mos_pelgo after liberating it from the_red_key_raiders_mining_collective, continuing to wear the_armor and take a_stand against the_red_key_raiders_forces.
meeting_malakili, the_former_beastmaster for jabba, framed for killing a_group of red_key_raiders, cobb agrees to accompany malakili – and the_infant_heir of jabba he is protecting – back to mos_pelgo (also known as freetown) to start a_different_life.
in empire's_end (2017), set about a month before the_events of the_mandalorian_episode "chapter 9
:_the_marshal", cobb and malakili, continue to work together to create a_deal with the_tusken_raiders to keep the_town mos_pelgo protected.
the_tusken_raiders agree, due to the_town being in a_sacred_location and having a_hutt, and being promised the_pearl from inside a_krayt_dragon.
however, red_key_members come and capture the_town before a_krayt_dragon can be killed,
reducing cobb's_arsenal to such_an_extent a_krayt_dragon is no longer able to try to do so.
while held captive, cobb is revealed to have once been a_slave and former_operative of crimson_dawn, having slave_markings on cobb back.
soon enough, the_tusken_raiders come and free cobb from the_red_key_members.
the_tusken_raiders then drive out the_crime_syndicate, and cobb vows to continue protecting the_town.
however, in the_aftermath, the_town is turned against the_tusken_raiders, and malakili leaves with the_hutt.
the_mandalorian (2020) ===
in may 2020, it was reported that timothy_olyphant would appear as cobb_vanth in the_second_season of the_mandalorian_web_television_series, potentially confirming the_character's_mandalorian_armour from the_aftermath_trilogy to have been that of boba_fett.
in the_second_season's_premiere, "chapter 9:
the_marshal", the_show's_title_character arrives in mos_pelgo looking for a_mandalorian and is surprised to find cobb instead, who is wearing fett's_mandalorian_armor.
following a_brief_standoff, after which cobb summarises how he acquired the_armour, he offers to give he armor to a_mandalorian in exchange for he assistance in killing the_krayt_dragon he failed to kill in the_aftermath_trilogy, allying with the_tusken_raiders once again to do so.
thanks to an_ingenious_idea by the_mandalorian to use a_bantha as a_suicide_bomber and have a_bantha detonate once the_dragon eats it, which nearly results in failure and the_mandalorian's death, they manage to kill the_dragon, obtaining a_pearl in the_process.
following this, cobb honors they agreement by giving up the_armor to the_mandalorian, and the_two_part on good_terms.== reception ==
upon the_character's_initial_appearance in the_aftermath_trilogy, speculation was common as to the_character's_mandalorian_armour belonging to boba_fett, or the_character themselves being a_disguised_fett; the_former_theory was proven true in the_second_season of the_mandalorian.
olyphant's_portrayal of cobb in the_mandalorian was generally praised, with rachel_leishman of the_mary_sue describing the_character's_backstory of acquiring the_armour of fett as "[h]onestly, iconic", and comic_book_resources drawing comparisons of olyphant's_portrayal to "basically [his_justified_character]raylan_givens...in space".
techradar additionally expressed interest in seeing a spin-off developed around the_character.

i decided to deliver as subtle of a_performance as i would on camera.
during iden_versio_audition_process for the_game, gavanakar was not told that the_project gavanakar was auditioning for was battlefront_ii nor that gavanakar was auditioning for the_lead_role, but noted that gavanakar knowledge of the_gaming_industry assisted gavanakar in "[putting] two and two together."
she commented that "i just got an_audition and it said [...]
ea_motive.
when you send someone like me, who is a_hardcore_gamer, an_audition like this, i knew exactly_what it was.

we had access to a_lucasfilm_story_group_member every day on set.we really found out who [iden] was together.we worked with military_consultants to figure out how we moved together as a_squad; all of these_things took a_lot of care and conversation.

"gavankar added that "all the way up until the_moment [the_player begins battlefront_ii], [iden's]_story has been dark,_dark,_dark_side.

battlefront_ii ====
iden_versio's_first_video_game_appearance was in star_wars_battlefront_ii (2017), where she is portrayed by janina_gavankar.she is the_protagonist of the_game's_single-player_campaign, and she is also a_playable_character in game's_multiplayer_mode.
in the_video_game's_campaign, she is established as the_commander of inferno_squad, an_imperial_special_forces_unit.
gavankar also described inferno_squad as a_black_ops
unit.she_inferno_squad_mates in the_game are gideon_hask and del_meeko.
throughout the_game, iden_versio is accompanied by id10, a_seeker_droid which she nicknames dio.
tj_ramini, del_meeko's_voice_actor, notes that iden and del "have a_bit of a_banter, a_bit of a_laugh," throughout the_game.
after being freed from rebel_captivity by id10, the_player first controls iden on endor during the_events of return of the_jedi.
iden leads inferno_squad against the_rebellion in the_battle of endor, during which they witness the_destruction of the_second_death_star.
iden then meets with iden father, admiral_garrick_versio and the_two_receive_orders from a_now_deceased_emperor_palpatine in the_form of a_hologram_recording.
one of a_now_deceased_emperor_palpatine's_posthumous_orders is for the_empire to perform operation:
cinder, which involved devastating many_imperial_planets in order to instill fear in the_galaxy and emphasize the_empire's_authority.
one of the_planets targeted by operation:
cinder is iden's_homeworld of vardos.
inferno_squad is sent to vardos to retrieve gleb, an_imperial_ally, so that she is not caught in the_destruction of vardos.
iden ideologically disagrees with operation:
cinder, as it conflicts with iden's_belief that the_empire stands for peace and order.
as a_result of she_internal_conflict with operation: cinder, iden disobeys imperial_commands to not rescue civilians, and she defects from the_empire.
del_meeko joins iden, while hask remains loyal to the_empire.
following she defection from the_empire, the_player continues to control iden, who briefly was unaligned, but soon joins the in-universe rebellion movement.
toward the_end of the_game's_campaign, iden participates in the_battle of jakku, the_final_large-scale_military_battle of the in-universe galactic civil war.the player controls iden as iden assists the_rebellion in defeating the_empire.
during the_battle, iden engages - and bests_-_hask in a_dogfight and confronts her_father on her_father ship as his_ship is being destroyed by rebel fire.her pleads with her_father to follow her to safety, but her_father refuses and urges her to survive.
following the_rebellion's_victory, her begins a_romantic_relationship with her_inferno_squad_partner, del_meeko.
nearly 30 years pass, and in the_campaign's_epilogue, it is revealed that iden and del have married and had a_daughter.the_campaign ends with a_cliffhanger after hask, now aligned with the_first_order_killsbattlefront_ii:resurrection =====
iden returns in the_star_wars_battlefront_ii:
resurrection_downloadable_content (dlc).mitch_dyer, the_co-writer of battlefront_ii_details
that "when the_resurrection_dlc begins, [...]
iden is in a_time of peace.
the_galaxy is at peace — there is no_war."
while the_initial_battlefront_ii_campaign features chapters in which the_player controls other_characters like luke_skywalker or lando_calrissian, the_resurrection_dlc focuses entirely on iden.
dyer commented that this is because "one of the_key_pieces of feedback [the_development_team] got was that people really liked playing as iden.
dyer's_an_interesting_and_compelling_new_character in the_star_wars_universe
, so we wanted to really focus the_rest of the_story on dyer.
and del's_daughter is revealed to be named zay in resurrection.
toward the_end of the_resurrection_dlc, while infiltrating hask's_first_order_star_destroyer with del's_daughter daughter zay and del's_daughter_partner_shriv, iden_versio steals the_plans for a_first_order_dreadnought.
iden confronts and kills hask but is mortally wounded in the_process, and dies before del's_daughter can escape the_star_destroyer, although zay, dio and shriv manage to get away on a_stolen_tie_fighter and send the_dreadnought_plans to general_leia_organa's_resistance_movement.
leia then sends the_trio to gather the_resistance's_allies in the_outer_rim.

the_character of iden_versio received mixed_opinions.
in a_review of the_inferno_squad_novel, sean_keane of new_york_daily_news wrote that "we get pov_sections from all_four_members of the_squad, but iden is by far the most developed.
iden's a_great_lead and the_inferno_squad_novel highlights the_strengths and weaknesses of the_idealized_imperial_upbringing.
iden is a_talented_soldier, but struggles with emotion and attachment.
in
his_review of star_wars_battlefront_ii, bryan_bishop of the_verge praised janina_gavankar's_performance, opining that iden delivers some_real_pathos with iden performance.
"bishop added, "[iden] may be an_imperial, but iden's also a_hero in the_classic_star_wars_tradition:
iden fights for the_ideals that have been instilled in iden from birth, and carries with iden the_kind of devil-may-care_swagger that made han_solo a household name.
hoggins of the_telepgraph wrote that gavankar joined an_"exclusive_club of women leading star_wars_stories, with iden_versio standing alongside daisy [ridley]'s rey and felicity_jones'_jyn_erso from rogue one.
in
a_negative_review of resurrection, hayden_dingman of pcworld opines that the_setup to the_dlc is promising due to the_believability of iden's_stakes in comparison with the_main_campaign and the_built-in_emotional_hook of del_meeko's_death, compounded by iden fighting alongside del_meeko's_daughter zay.
hayden_dingman of pcworld, however, added that battlefront_ii's_campaign, proper_ending included, is anemic_start to finish.
just_so_much_wasted_potential.
i don't know whether blame lies with disney or with ea and dice, but the_developers had an_amazing_character in iden versio and did nothing with an_amazing_character in iden versio."
samuel_roberts of pc_gamer had similar_sentiments, commenting that "most of the_tension is removed from the_story" once "iden_versio and her_comrade, del, basically join the_rebellion.
"roberts criticized the_lack of exploration of iden's_imperial_perspective, commenting that "in the_opening, [the_player gets] the_sense that iden and company believe in the_sense of order that the_empire brings—but iden and company_perspective isn't explored with much_greater_depth than that.
when iden and company turn against the_empire, as the_empire turns on the_empire own people, iden and company make the_snap_decision to change sides with very_little_ambiguity.

darth_vader_comic_book_series.
chelli_lona_aphra became a_breakout_character, and began appearing in chelli_lona_aphra own_comic_series, star_wars: doctor_aphra, in december 2016.she is a_morally_questionable,_criminal_archaeologist initially in the_employ of darth_vader, but later in hiding from chelli_lona_aphra.
aphra is the_first_original_star_wars_character not from the_films to lead a_marvel_comic_series.
character ==
aphra is a_criminal_archaeologist with an_expert_knowledge of droid_and_weapons_technologies, with a_particular_interest in ancient_weapons and jedi_artifacts.
aphra travels in a_unique_starship called the ark angel, which features a_custom_white-and-blue_paint_job.
starwars.com described aphra as "a (mostly) morally bankrupt, in-over-her-head archaeologist", and slate called aphra "driven, selfish, decisive, and wildly unpredictable".
syfy_wire called the_character an anti-hero who "shares the_snark of han_solo and sexual_charisma of lando_calrissian, but toes the_line between right and wrong far more regularly than these_two_characters—and more often than not steps over it into the downright naughty.
"ign explained, "aphra has all of han's_swaggery, scoundrel-y_charm, but little of his_noble_streak.
kieron_gillen noted that the_character's_main_interest is "this_weird_obsession kieron_gillen has with uncovering old_stuff".
noting that "aphra's sarcasm and the careful way kieron gillen codes
kieron_gillen_words are a_vital_part of kieron_gillen_character", starwars.com also explains that though kieron_gillen is somewhat of a_genius, aphra's_ability to think on kieron_gillen toes is what has kept kieron_gillen alive in situations where kieron_gillen genius fails kieron_gillen.
kieron_gillen noted that readers can never be sure what the_character will or will not do.
doctor_aphra_writer_si_spurrier explained that despite the_expectation that star_wars_characters "will always do the_right_thing", aphra makes mistakes and sometimes chooses the unexpected.
sarah_kuhn, the_author of doctor_aphra:
an_audiobook_original, agreed that "[aphra] is the_definition of chaos ...
you never really know exactly_what she's going to do, which means that, personally, i think she's having the_most_fun of anyone in the_star_wars_galaxy.
in
creating the_character, gillen looked to what gillen called the indiana jones archaeologist archetype", which gillen believed fit well into star_wars.
gillen_original_concept for aphra was indiana_jones and gillen_ramshackle_problem solving, but with inverted_ethics.
gillen said that aphra falls somewhere between a_hero and a_villain in that "you do see she do good_things and bad_things.
"gillen added, "she's kind_of_funbut at the_same_time
, there's a_really_dark_heart to she.
"he explained, "she has this_very_fun-loving_attitude, she's very fun to be around, but she's really bad as a_person.
... was designed to be darth_vader's_foil ...
she has to do a_lot of the_talking when darth_vader's doesn't.
darth_vader will not make jokes.
to be even_a_fun_book to read, you need her to lighten it.
but when you introduce her as a_lead, that kind of changes the dynamic entirely.
a) her becomes slightly more serious, and b)everyone else around her becomes a lot more deadly.
spurrier said, "her knows that darth_vader is probably not a_nice_person.her's aware that space_fascism is not necessarily a good thingbut it may be the_right_thing for a_chaotic_universe".
gillen compared aphra to darth_vader in that_fans root for both as anti-heroes, but explained that while aphra is a_"bad_person in many_ways", darth_vader is on another_level as "one of the_greatest_villains of all_time.
"gillen added, "you can root [for her], because her makes really_bad_life_decisions and sort_of_rolls with them ...
she doesn't like killing people.
she's not like a_random_murderer.
"he noted that aphra is complex in that she is "adamantly_pro-empire" but still tends not to obey the_empire's_rules.
syfy_wire described aphra as a_"queer_woman of color", noting she affinity for women and slightly_asian_appearance.
slate agreed that the_character is "drawn with a_suggestion of asian_heritage", and also noted, "she aches for two_different_women who have claims to she heart—two_women whom, inevitably, she must betray to survive.
"gillen confirmed aphra_sexuality, saying aphra has written she primarily romantically interested in women rather than men, but noted that "star_wars doesn't really have the_terminology that we do ... homophobia as we know homophobia doesn't really exist in the star_wars
universe".
of aphra's_relationship with magna_tolvan, gillen said magna_tolvan, gillen imagined "this_hard-bitten,_kind_of_very_serious_kind of person chasing down this_more_whimsical_person and the_sexual_tension ...
the_flip of it is, aphra's_the_person who's also pursuing tolvan.

darth_vader (2015–2016) ====
aphra first appeared in star_wars:
darth vader #3 (march 2015), which is set after the_original_star_wars_film and was created by writer_kieron_gillen and artist_salvador_larroca.
aphra's_appearance in the_comic is being adapted as an_audiobook for release on july 21, 2020.in the_story, she is recruited by darth_vader to aid in darth_vader schemes.
at the_end of the_series darth_vader attempts to kill aphra, but she escapes, leaving darth_vader thinking darth_vader succeeded.
gillen said of the_story:i was pretty sure that i was going to have to kill aphra, you know?vader is very good at what know?vader does ...
i looked at that and went, 'wait.
aphra has completely left a_way that aphra can do this.
'i completely buy that darth_vader would fall for that because darth_vader gets angry.
you know what i mean?
it's almost like aphra planned aphra own escape for me.
that was one_moment that aphra kind of escaped, which is such an aphra thing to do.
from 2015 to 2016, aphra appeared in star_wars:
vader_down, a_six-issue_crossover_comic_miniseries which includes vader_down own_debut_issue, issues #13–15 of darth vader, and issues #13–14 of the_star_wars_comic_series.
concurrent with the_star_wars_comic_series, in 2016 aphra also appeared in the_rebel_jail_arc of the_star_wars_comic, which comprises star_wars
issues #16–19.doctor_aphra (2016–2019) ====
after first being teased in september 2016 as star_wars: classified
,_star_wars:
doctor_aphra was announced in october 2016, and began to be released in december_2016.the_story picks up after vader's_attempt to kill aphra at the_end of the_star_wars_comic_series.
doctor_aphra is in hiding so that vader will not discover that doctor_aphra is alive, but needs to get back into doctor_aphra life as an_archaeologist
so she can repay she enormous_debts to the_wookiee_black_krrsantan, and fulfill she promise to help locate the_people who tortured the_wookiee_black_krrsantan in the_past.
gillen said gillen wanted to write the_series to explore "what makes she tick and why she's doing what she's doing".
gillen wrote issues #1 to #13, and then cowrote #14 to #19 with simon_spurrier.
simon_spurrier took over for gillen_gillen as of #20.larroca and kev_walker shared the_artwork for issue #1, with kev_walker doing it alone for #2 and #3, followed by kev_walker and various_other_artists rotating in and out of the_series.
according to simon_spurrier:the_particular_beauty and the_particular_attraction of something like aphra is that ...
we all grew up with star_wars and we all love that worldand we all recognize itand
we all respond to its_particular_aesthetic and its_particular_vibe.
but at the_same_time, aphra is very much in aphra own funny_little_niche and off doing aphra own thing and, yes, occasionally overlapping with stuff in the_wider_universe in a_way that always feels like a_cute_easter_egg rather than a_continuity_obstacle ...
aphra's_the_thing that allows us as comic_creators, especially in a_shared_universe, to tell very_different,_very_unique_stories that you just couldn't necessarily get away with, with any of the_more_mainstream_characters and groups.
the_series was nominated for outstanding_comic_book at the_30th_glaad_media_awards.
alan_scherstuhl of slate wrote of the_series, "the_stories, like death_stars, tend to explode, but unpredictably so, with escalating_twists, striking moral_quandaries, and only occasionally anything like a_truly_happy_ending.
"he explains, "besides the_vigorous_storytelling and startling_twists, the_doctor_aphra_comics ... fill in shades of gray that are otherwise missing from star_wars'_moral_spectrum.
schedeen of ign called doctor_aphra "marvel's riskiest star wars project to date", but noted that "the_distance from the_movies gives doctor_aphra a_greater_sense of freedom in terms of tone,_style_and_plot_possibilities.
"schedeen described the_series as "very much like a_bizarro_han_solo_story with a_dash of indiana_jones thrown in", and noted that it "thrives on it dark_sense of humor.
in
2017
, doctor_aphra appeared in the_five-issue_crossover_miniseries the_screaming_citadel, which is made up of doctor_aphra own debut_issue, issues #31–32 of star_wars, and issues #7–8 of doctor_aphra.

the_trigger (2017) ====
the_trigger (2017) ==== is a_short_story written by gillen, published in the_2017_star_wars_anthology from a_certain_point of view.
set during the_1977_star_wars_film on the_day that the_empire destroys the_planet_alderaan with the_death_star, a_short_story written by gillen, published in the_2017_star_wars_anthology from a_certain_point of view finds doctor_aphra captured by imperial_troops and reacting to the_news of alderaan's_destruction.
slate noted:her_reaction to the_news is complex: her's awed, even a little turned on, at the_thought of such_destructive_might.
her annoys the_imperials by excitedly gaming out what tech could have possibly achieved it.
her_wonders aloud whether the_death_star has a "trigger"—whether any_one_person flipped the_switch that murdered billions.
her_wonders if killing that many from a_distance is easier than killing one_person in front of you.
gillen said gillen wrote the_story with the_intent of "working out a_fairly_logical_reason, why with her_background, her thinks the_empire is bad to the_alternative.
if you grew up in a_galactic_civil_war, i think peace by any_means might be better than war.
that's kind of aphra's_take.
aphra can handle everything.
her_lies to her.
but normal_people?normal_people would probably like to live under a_fascist_regime rather than actually people just killing each other in a_war.
and that's a_really_dark_hole to think aboutbut
i can buy someone believing that with aphra's_background.
"video_game ===
doctor_aphra was a_playable_character in the_2017_player versus player_real-time_strategy_mobile_game, star wars: force_arena.
impact and reception ==
increased_sales of darth_vader_#3 convinced gillen of doctor_aphra's_instant_popularity, and aphra called the_character "a big part" of the_unexpected_success of the_darth_vader_series.
doctor_aphra became a_breakout_character, and was placed in doctor_aphra own series, doctor_aphra, which is the_first_ongoing_marvel_star_wars_comic focused on an_original_character not from the_films.
gillen said in april 2018, "[doctor_aphra] was the_number_two_trade in february.
a_completely_new_character_selling that well is shocking in comics.
that_kind of response is enormously impressive, as that_kind of response doesn't happen often."
he added, "sal[vador_larroca] and i cooked sal[vador_larroca up but enough_people have written sal[vador_larroca now to make [sal[vador_larroca] bigger than he.
sal[vador_larroca definitely feels like sal[vador_larroca's outgrown me, essentially.
so i quite like giving sal[vador_larroca away to other_people who'll get to play with sal[vador_larroca.
spurrier added:most of what we've seen so far in star_wars is goodies versus baddies.
and aphra ain't that.
and i would suggest that the_reason people ... respond more to han_solo than people respond to luke_skywalker is because luke_skywalker's not just playing the_goodie.
luke_skywalker's a little more complicated than that.
and aphra is 100% the same but from the_other_direction.
moore of syfy_wire deemed aphra "arguably_the_best_thing" about the_darth_vader_series, and catrina_dennis of starwars.com called her "the type of character that steals every_scene
flint of syfy_wire described aphra "an_edgy,_cool_and_refreshingly_diverse_character", and bria_lavorgna of starwars.com called she "one of the_coolest_characters in star_wars right now.
that aphra's_first_appearance was an_homage to indiana_jones, alan_scherstuhl of slate said that she subsequently "gains a_depth that indiana_jones never quite did", and praised the_fact that gillen has "never exploited or exoticized gillen sexuality.
aphra's_"feats of technological_prowess coupled with she_unpredictable_personality" as the_characteristics which "make she a character worth watching", dennis wrote, "aphra has stolen the_hearts of fans everywhere with she_unpredictable_humor and a_complicated_backstory that has unfolded into something much more than she introduction to the_saga may have let on.

a_star_wars_wikistar_wars:doctor_aphra on wookieepedia, a_star_wars_wikigrand_admiral_thrawn (native_name: mitth'raw'nuruodo; birth_name: kivu'raw'nuru) is a_fictional_character in the_star_wars_franchise.
introduced in the_1991_timothy_zahn_novel_heir to the_galactic_empire's, he is an_imperial_military_commander who has taken control of the_galactic_empire's remaining forces five years after the_events of the_1983_film_return of the_jedi.
thrawn faces off against classic_star_wars_characters_luke_skywalker, princess_leia, han_solo, chewbacca, and lando_calrissian in the thrawn trilogy (1991–1993), but is ultimately defeated.
thrawn is seemingly resurrected in the_hand of thrawn duology (1997–98), and thrawn backstory is explored in various_other_novels, short_stories, comics, and video_games in the_star_wars_expanded_universe.
lucasfilm rebranded the expanded the_star_wars_expanded_universe works as star_wars_legends in 2014 and declared lucasfilm non-canon to the_franchise, but thrawn was reintroduced back into the_canon in the_third_season of the_3d_cgi_animated_television_series star_wars_rebels, where thrawn was voiced by lars_mikkelsen.
rebels is set at a_point in the_star_wars_timeline earlier than thrawn's_storylines in the_legends_continuity and, as such, sees his_defeat much earlier on, shortly before the_events of the_original_1977_film_star_wars.
despite this, thrawn is mentioned as still being alive in the_second_season of the_live-action_web_television_series the_mandalorian (2020), which takes place a few years after return of the_jedi, much like the original thrawn stories from legends.
the_character is also featured in a_new_thrawn_book trilogy by zahn, consisting of star_wars: thrawn (2017), thrawn: alliances (2018) and thrawn: treason (2019).another_book_trilogy, called thrawn ascendancy,
began in september 2020 with book_i
:_chaos_rising and book_ii:

several_star_wars_action_figures and other_merchandising have been produced of the_character.
character ==
thrawn first appeared in the_1991_timothy_zahn_novel_heir to the_empire, the first installment of what became known as the thrawn trilogy.the
1991 timothy_zahn_novel_heir is a_grand_admiral in the_imperial_navy, and categorically "the most brilliant of the_emperor's_minions".
a_member of the_alien_chiss_species, thrawn is described as a tall, solidly built humanoid with blue_skin and glowing red_eyes who wears the_white_uniform befitting his_rank.his has risen in power thanks to his_"tactical_brilliance and cunning", and has been described as "one of the_most_threatening_antagonists" in the_star_wars universe.his is an_unparalleled_military_strategist and tactical_genius who has made extensive_study of military_intelligence and the_artwork of other_cultures, and the thrawn trilogy finds his commanding the_remnants of the_imperial_fleet in a_series of stunning_victories against the_new_republic.his_full_name was given as mitth'raw'nuruodo.
ign described the_character as "diabolical, brilliant and ruthless".
zahn describes thrawn's_command_style as considerably different from that of darth_vader and other_typical_imperial_commanders; instead of punishing failure and dissent, thrawn promotes creativity among thrawn crew and accepts ideas from subordinates.
zahn said in 2017:
most of the_imperial_leaders we see in the_movies rule through a_combination of fear and manipulation.
i wanted to create something different: a_commander who could lead through loyalty.
the_result was thrawn, a_tactical_genius whose_troops follow him willingly, and who will fight for him whether or not him's watching over whose_troops shoulders.
referencing zahn's_annotations in the_20th_anniversary_edition of heir to the_empire, john_booth wrote in wired that zahn "created and developed thrawn as a_character [by] deliberately establishing the_grand_admiral as a_villain who leads not by coercion and fear but through valuing strategy and loyalty".
zahn explained in 2008 that thrawn's_version of the_empire is different than that of palpatine because thrawn does not have palpatine's megalomania and xenophobia.
calling thrawn and mara jade thrawn favorite of the_characters thrawn created, zahn noted in 2006 that writing the_grand_admiral "provides the_intellectual_challenge of trying to come up with new,_clever,_and_(hopefully)_workable_tactics and strategies".
portrayal ===
thrawn is voiced by tris_king in the_1994_computer_game_star_wars:tie fighter, and by tim_russell in the_1997_audio_drama_dark_forces: soldier for the_empire.
in seasons three and four of star_wars_rebels, thrawn is voiced by lars_mikkelsen.
appearances ==
legends works ===
according to zahn, lou_aronica of bantam_spectra had negotiated a_book_deal with lucasfilm in 1989, and the_publisher put zahn's name at the_top of their_list of possible_authors.
he said, "my_original_instructions from lucasarts  [sic] consisted of exactly_two_rules: the_books were to start 3–5 years after return of the_jedi, and i couldn't use anyone who'd been explicitly killed off in the_movies.
"zahn used information from the_original_film_trilogy as he_primary_source, but supplemented that with details from the_many_sourcebooks created for west_end_games'_star_wars: the_roleplaying_game, saying that they "saved me from having to reinvent the_wheel many times".
in turn, each_novel in the_original_film_trilogy had its_role-playing_game_sourcebook created for its by west_end_games.
introduced in the_thrawn_trilogy (1991–93), thrawn became a_fan favorite and subsequently appeared in multiple_works in what became known as the_star_wars_expanded_universe, including novels, comics and video_games, through 2006.he is often cited as one of the_most_popular_characters in the_franchise.
star_wars_rebelsexecutive_producer_dave_filoni said of the_character in 2016, "you couldn't have grown up a_star_wars_fan without encountering thrawn in heir to the_empire.
it was a_dark_time when there weren't any_more_movies, and it blew our_minds that there could be more.
the_original_film_trilogy is widely credited with reviving_interest in the_star_wars_franchise.
in_2010,_star_wars:
star_wars_rebelsexecutive_producer_dave_filoni_star_wars_rebelsexecutive_producer_dave_filoni expressed interest in using thrawn in that_series.
some_fans of zahn's_thrawn_series had long hoped the_books would be adapted, and after the_2012_announcement that the_walt_disney_company had acquired lucasfilm and planned to produce film_sequels to return of the_jedi, zahn commented that if material from the_expanded_universe was used in the_films, we'd all be thrilled to death".
with the_2012_acquisition of lucasfilm by disney, most of the_licensed_star_wars_novels and comics produced since the_originating_1977_film star_wars were rebranded as star_wars legends and declared non-canon to the star_wars franchise in april 2014.
though lucasfilm made it clear that new_media would "not tell the_same_story told in the_post-return of the_jedi_expanded_universe", lucasfilm was also established that "creators of new_star_wars_entertainment have full_access to the_rich_content of the_expanded_universe.
"acknowledging
that thrawn had long been considered by lucasfilm when developing projects, filoni later said in 2016 that in particular the_character had been on the_character list of potential_villains when developing star_wars_rebels.
thrawn_trilogy (1991–1993) ====
the_thrawn_trilogy, also known as the_heir to the_empire_trilogy, was written by timothy_zahn between 1991_and_1993.in_addition to thrawn, the_empire_trilogy introduced several_notable_characters, including mara_jade and talon_karrde.
approximately five years after the_events depicted in return of the_jedi, the_rebel_alliance, now known as the_new_republic, has driven out the_remnants of the_old_imperial_starfleet to a_distant_corner of the_galaxy and is attempting to set up a_functional_government.
princess_leia and han_solo are married and expecting twins.
luke_skywalker has become the first in a_long-awaited_new_line of jedi_knights.
thousands of light_years away, grand_admiral_thrawn, the last and most brilliant of the_12_grand_admirals, has taken command of the_shattered_imperial_fleet and prepared the_shattered_imperial_fleet to attack the_new_republic.
thrawn is searching for a_dark_jedi to join thrawn side and is confident thrawn can restore empire.
in heir to empire (1991), master_tactician_grand_admiral_thrawn plots to destroy the_new_republic despite their_numerical_advantage over the_remaining_imperial_forces.
he sets he sights on the_wayland_storehouse of the_late_emperor_palpatine, which contains a_massive_array of spaarti_cloning_cylinders and a_working_cloaking_shield.
to this_end, thrawn and thrawn subordinate gilad_pellaeon, captain of the_star_destroyer_chimaera, enlist the_help of smuggler_talon_karrde and he second-in-command mara jade to obtain several_salamander-like_creatures called ysalamiri.
thrawn uses the_ysalamiri, which possess the_natural_ability to disrupt the_force, to subdue the_storehouse's_guardian joruus c'baoth, a_twisted_clone of a_jedi_master whom the_grand_admiral had killed years before.
c'baoth offers c'baoth allegiance in exchange for two_acolytes to bend to c'baoth will: darth_vader's_twin_children, luke and leia.
thrawn sends some of thrawn noghri killers to capture luke and a_pregnant_leia, but some of his_noghri_killers attempts repeatedly fail.
leia defends leia from one_attack and is surprised when the_noghri suddenly surrenders.
thrawn launches thrawn first_offensive, a_series of hit-and-run_attacks into new_republic_territory, and then steals a_complement of mole_miners from lando_calrissian's_mining_operations on nkllon.
in need of warships, and with his_previous_tactics having forced over_100_lightly_manned_ships to be stationed at the_sluis_van_shipyards as his planned, thrawn_invades.his_stormtroopers use the_stolen_miners to board and hijack the_ships, but the_stolen_miners are thwarted when lando can seize control of the_stolen_miners remotely.
the_grand_admiral withdraws the_grand_admiral forces, but thanks to thrawn's_plotting, the_grand_admiral new republic nemesis admiral ackbar is soon arrested for treason.
dark_force rising (1992) reveals that before the_clone_wars, the_old_republic had constructed a_fleet of highly_automated_heavy_cruisers, known as the katana_fleet.
a_virus infected the_crews of the_entire_fleet and drove them insane.the_entire_fleet was never seen again until smuggler_talon_karrde discovered the_entire_fleet (several years before the_events of the_first_book).with_access to palpatine's_private_storehouse on the_planetwayland, thrawn presses thrawn advantage to marshal more_forces for the_battle against the_new_republic.
mara_jade, in an_attempt to exonerate the_empire's_warrant for karrde's_arrest, goes to thrawn and offers to reveal the_location of the_entire_fleet.
instead, thrawn has mara_jade followed and karrde is captured.

leia convinces them that them have been deceived and effectively enslaved by the_empire, and them switch sides.
with ackbar temporarily neutralized as a_tactical_opponent, thrawn leads an_army of clones to claim the_so-called_"katana_fleet", outmaneuvering luke, lando, and han_solo.
in the_last_command (1993), set about a month after the_previous_book, thrawn uses the_katana_fleet, manned with clones, to mount a_successful_offensive against the_new_republic.
seizing one_planet after the other, the_grand_admiral soon immobilizes the_galactic_capital_world, coruscant.the_grand_admiral has placed multiple_cloaked_asteroids around one_planet, and through a_ruse, the_grand_admiral has led the_the_new_republic_leadership to believe that coruscant is surrounded with the_new_republic_leadership.
learning of the_deception, the_republic_fleet attacks the_imperial_shipyards at bilbringi to capture a_device that can find the_cloaked_asteroids, but thrawn's_forces intercept and surround the_cloaked_asteroids.
meanwhile, luke and leia lead a_group to destroy the_cloning_facility on wayland, successfully killing joruus c'baoth and destroying the_cloning_cylinders.
just as thrawn and pellaeon learn that the_noghri aided in the_attack on wayland, thrawn's noghri bodyguard, rukh, kills the_grand_admiral—whose_last_words are, "but ... it was so artistically done.
the_tide of battle at bilbringi turns, and with the_hope of victory dashed by thrawn's_death, pellaeon orders the_imperial_forces to retreat.
denis_lawson narrates the_abridged_audiobook of heir to the_empire, and anthony_daniels narrates dark force rising and
the_last_command.
lucasfilm_and_varèse_sarabande_records_producer_robert_townson discussed the_creation of a_score to promote the_trilogy.
all_three_books were adapted as comic_books by dark_horse_comics between 1995 and 1998.
the_series was divided into six_issues per book, written by mike_baron, who says, i didn't invent any_language.
all_the_language is zahn's.
the_first_volume was illustrated by french_artists olivier_vatine and fred_blanchard, the second by terry_dodson and kevin_nowlan, and the third by edvin_biuković and eric_shanower.
the_entire_trilogy was collected in 2009 as a_single_graphic_novel.
heir to the_empire reached #1 on the_new_york_times_best_seller_list, and the_entire_trilogy sold a_combined_total of 15_million_copies.
the_entire_trilogy is widely credited with revitalizing the_star_wars_franchise.

this_renewed_interest was a_factor in george_lucas'_decision to create the_prequel_trilogy has been called influential, much-loved, and ground breaking".

the_hand of thrawn duology (1997–1998) ====
zahn's_specter of the past (1997) finds thrawn seemingly resurrected ten years after zahn's_specter of the_past_(1997)_death when zahn's_specter of the past (1997) reappears to lead the_decimated_imperial_forces against the_unstable_new_republic.
a_record_surfaces called the caamasi document, which indicates that a_small_group of bothans were perpetrators in the_tragic_destruction of the_planet_caamas and causes more_than_a_hundred_alien_warships to gather in orbit over bothans homeworld, which the_empire hopes to use to the_empire benefit.
in vision of the_future (1998), admiral_gilad_pellaeon admits that the_empire, down to only_a_few_sectors, is now fighting a_losing_battle, and initiates peace_talks with princess_leia.
however, moff_disra hires a_con_artist, flim, to impersonate thrawn to motivate the_decimated_imperial_forces.
major_grodin_tierce, the_clone of a_former_stormtrooper imbued with thrawn's_tactical_intellect by the_grand_admiral himself, strategizes that thrawn_thrawn could also rally support for the_empire and intimidate the_new_republic.
the_tactic is successful until pellaeon and talon_karrde—on opposing_sides but both desiring peace—expose flim.
meanwhile, at a_fortress called the hand of thrawn, luke and mara discover a_gestating_and_near-complete_clone of thrawn, which is killed during luke and mara escape.
an_expedition by thrawn to the_galaxy's_unknown_regions is also mentioned.
finally, a_peace_treaty is signed by pellaeon and the_new_republic_president.

novels =====
thrawn appears as a_captain in the_1997_william_c._dietz_novella_dark_forces: soldier for the_empire.
thrawn also appears in the_1998_young_reader's_book galaxy of fear: the_swarm.
before the_theatrical_release of attack of the_clones, lucasfilm suggested that zahn write a_prequel-era_book.
zahn decided to have zahn 2004 novel survivor's quest (the_sequel to the_hand of thrawn_duology) cover the_end of the_outbound_flight_story_arc before exploring his_2004_novel_survivor's_quest (the_sequel to the_hand of thrawn_duology) beginning in zahn prequel novel.
in survivor's_quest, luke and mara journey to investigate the_wreckage of outbound_flight, a_jedi_expedition destroyed by thrawn years before.
newly discovered by the_chiss, the_remains turn out to be the_lure in a_trap laid by the_bloodthirsty_vagaari to avenge the_lure in a_trap laid by the_bloodthirsty_vagaari to avenge themselves on the_chiss on the_chiss.
zahn's_2006_novel_outbound_flight is set fifty years before survivor's_quest.
zahn's_2006_novel_outbound_flight follows the_story of the_doomed_titular_expedition, led by jedi_master_jorus_c'baoth, that is attacked by a_young_chiss_commander named mitth'raw'nuruodo—informally known as thrawn.
in the_story, a_republic_fleet comes across the_chiss for the_first_time.
the_alien_commander, thrawn, can handily defeat the_republic_ships despite inferior_weapons and numbers.
supreme_chancellor_palpatine seeks to destroy the_outbound_flight, and supreme_chancellor_palpatine and supreme_chancellor_palpatine agent kinman doriana convince thrawn that the_ship and thrawn jedi pose a_threat to the_peaceful_future of the_galaxy.
thrawn agrees, hoping to get c'baoth to turn back before taking more_drastic_action.its
jedi refuses and thrawn fires on the_ship, but doriana launches an_assault that kills every jedi and sends the_outbound_flight careening to doriana destruction on a_nearby_planet.

thrawn's_brother thrass and lorana, the_sole_surviving_jedi can.
thrawn is reprimanded by thrawn chiss superiors for thrawn hostile behavior, and summoned back to thrawn home planet csilla.
publishers_weekly called thrawn the "true star" of the_novel, noting that his_attack on the_ship, secretly influenced by palpatine's_agents, "insures his_own_eventual_exile from his_race and sets other_sinister_wheels in motion".
zahn said of writing the_novel, "
as always, it was immensely fun to play tactics with thrawn".
though starwars.com suggests that in outbound_flight, thrawn is "too smart and basically decent to become the_servant of palpatine that he later becomes", zahn explains:my_sense has always been that thrawn] was manipulating palpatine just as much as palpatine is manipulating palpatine.
after all, palpatine only came to the_empire so that palpatine could gain command_rank, collect all the military hardware palpatine was willing to give palpatine, and then get palpatine kicked back out to the_unknown_regions.
set between star_wars:

, zahn's_choices of one (2011) pits thrawn against the_alien_warlord nuso_esva, thrawn nemesis from the_unknown_regions.

with the_sequel_film star_wars: the_force awakens in production, in april 2014 most of the licensed star_wars novels and comics produced since the_1977_film star_wars were declared non-canon to the_franchise.
however, star_wars_rebels_executive_producer_dave_filoni announced at the_london_star_wars_celebration in july 2016 that thrawn would be reintroduced into the_franchise in the_third_season of the_rebels_series.
the_character debuted in the_season 3 premiere, "steps into shadow", which aired on september 24,
2016.though in legendsthrawn was mostly used in post-return of the_jedi_storylines, rebels takes place within the_five_years before the_events of the_sequel_film star_wars.
after seeing an_advanced_clip from the_series, zahn told starwars.com, "even_that_short_bit was awesome, and just a bit surrealistic.
authors don't get to see our_creations come to life very often, and it was a_real_treat to see a_walking, talking grand_admiral_thrawn".
acknowledging that thrawn had long been considered by lucasfilm when developing projects, star_wars_rebels_executive_producer_dave_filoni said that in particular, the_character had been on the_character list of potential_villains when developing rebels.
the_character explained that unlike how the_character ahsoka_tano has been a_foil for darth_vader in previous_seasons of rebels, "there's no_one to defend [the rebels] against thrawn.our want to treat the_character like a_big-time_villain, as much as darth_vader, but on the_strategic,_military_side of things.

cad_bane is a_fictional_character in the_star_wars_franchise.
created by george_lucas, dave_filoni and henry_gilroy, cad_bane made cad_bane debut as an_antagonist in the_2008_animated_series star_wars:
the_clone_wars, in which cad_bane is voiced by corey_burton.
cad_bane is depicted as a_ruthless_bounty_hunter from the_planet_duro who is usually employed by other_villains in the_series, such as the_separatist_alliance and the_hutt_crime_families.
known for utilising weapons and gadgets specifically designed to counter the_abilities of jedi, cad_bane was the_"preeminent_blaster-for-hire" during the_clone_wars.
aside from the_television_series, cad_bane appears in several_canon_and_non-canon_star_wars_media, such as comic_books and video_games.
since cad_bane first appearance in the_clone_wars, cad_bane quickly became a fan favorite, and has been highlighted as one of the_best_bounty_hunter_characters in the_star_wars_franchise, usually alongside the_likes of boba_fett and jango_fett.
appearances ==
television ===
the_clone_wars ====
cad_bane recurs in the_2008_animated_series star_wars: the_clone_wars.
cad_bane first appears in the_first_season's_finale_"hostage_crisis", in which cad_bane and aurra sing assemble a_team of fellow_bounty_hunters to rescue ziro the_hutt from the republic's prison facility.a_team of fellow_bounty_hunters infiltrate the_senate_building on coruscant, murdering all of the_guards and taking a_group of senators hostage as leverage to demand for ziro's release.
their_plan is successful, and the_bounty_hunters manage to escape with ziro, despite anakin_skywalker's_attempt to stop the_bounty_hunters.
bane makes bane first chronological appearance in the_second_season_premiere "holocron_heist", in which bane is hired by darth_sidious to steal the_holocron from the_vault of the_jedi_temple.
bane escapes with the_holocron and manages to evade anakin_skywalker and ahsoka_tano in "cargo of doom".
bane subsequently helps darth_sidious use the_holocron to kidnap several_force-sensitive_children in "children of the_force" before bane is captured by the_jedi.
obi-wan_kenobi and mace_windu force obi-wan_kenobi to take obi-wan_kenobi and mace_windu to the_holocron, and bane leads obi-wan_kenobi and mace_windu into a_trap in bane headquarters, giving bane time to flee.
the_third_season explores the_events leading up to bane_takeover of the_senate_building in season one.
evil_plans features bane capturing the_droids r2-d2 and c-3po, who involuntarily give bane the_schematics of the_senate_building.
the_following_episode "hunt for ziro", which takes place after "hostage_crisis", reveals that bane was hired to extract ziro from republic_custody by jabba the_hutt as ziro possessed a_datapad with incriminating_evidence against the_hutt crime families.
shortly after bane is congratulated by jabba for bane success, ziro escapes and the_bounty_hunter is hired to track down and capture hutthutt.
bane eventually finds ziro's_corpse on teth but realises a_datapad is missing.
after a_short_altercation with obi-wan_kenobi and quinlan_vos, who were also searching for the_hutt, bane escapes once again.
prior to the_fourth_season's_episode_"deception", bane is revealed to have intentionally been captured in order to infiltrate a_republic_prison; bane is hired by count_dooku to break moralo_eval out of the_facility.
unbeknownst to count dooku, obi-wan_kenobi poses as bounty_hunter_rako_hardeen and seeks to gain the_duo's_trust to uncover count dooku's plans.
following a_successful_prison_break and pursuit throughout the_outer_rim, the_trio finally reach the_box: a_competition to decide which of a_small_group of chosen_bounty_hunters will participate in the_separatist_plot to kidnap chancellor_palpatine on naboo.
bane and "hardeen" survive the_events of the_box and go on to kidnap the_chancellor in "crisis on naboo", but obi-wan_kenobi's_deception is soon revealed and obi-wan_kenobi manages to foil the_separatist_plot, leading to bane's arrest once more.
following the_series'_cancellation in 2014, creator_dave_filoni confirmed that bane was slated to return in an_unfinished_story_arc which saw bane and a_group of bounty_hunters mentoring the_young_boba_fett, helping bane follow in bane late_father's_footsteps.
the_end of the_arc would see bane and fett having a_standoff, which presumably resulted in the_former's_death.
rebels ===
years after the_clone_wars came to an_end, sabine_wren somehow heard of bane, and designed a_graffiti_image of bane, inspired by bane daring combat skills.a_graffiti_image of him can be briefly seen in the_second_episode of the_first_season of star_wars_rebels, "fighter flight".
comics ===
bane also appears in the_five-part_marvel_comics_comic_book_miniseries star_wars:
darth_maul, set before the_events of the_prequel_trilogy, where he aides the_titular_character in kidnapping a_jedi_padawan.
legends ===
in april 2014, most of the_licensed_star_wars_novels and comics produced since the_originating_1977_film star_wars were rebranded as star_wars legends and declared non-canon to the_rest of the_franchise by lucasfilm.
cad_bane has appeared in several_comics and video_games set in the_legends_continuity.
characteristics ==
character_creation ===
the_titular_character was created as a_recurring_antagonist for the_2008_star_wars: the_clone_wars_television_series set during the_prequel_film_trilogy.
the_season_one_finale "hostage_crisis"_director_giancarlo_volpe compared cad_bane to another_star_wars_bounty_hunter, boba_fett, stating:the_crew loves cad_bane, and i really think the_fans will, too.the_titular_character brings a_serious_bad-ass_sensibility to star_wars.the_titular_character's_a_lethal_and_ruthless_bounty_hunter, and you see that right away in the_episode.
unlike boba_fett, cad doesn't take prisoners.
originally, supervising_director_dave_filoni and series_writer_henry_gilroy planned to create the_durge_character that was already introduced in the_2003_micro-series.
durge would instead be redesigned as a_human_character but this_exploration was short lived after the_suggestion of series_producer and star_wars_creator_george_lucas to go western.
george_lucas took inspiration from western_film_actors such as lee_van_cleef's_portrayals of angel_eyes in the_good, the bad, and the ugly and of colonel_mortimer in for a_few_dollars more while corey_burton uses peter_lorre's_voice as inspiration.
these_characters'_western_influences help to bring bane to life while still containing the_features of the_duros_species in the_star_wars_universe with bane
own_original_characterization.
corey_burton's_voice would then be modified on the_computer by the_series'_sound_production_team.
while filoni researched the_character, the_character happened to come across an_unlabeled_concept_art of a_gun-toting_bounty_hunter with a_wide-brimmed_hat from the_original_trilogy and that_concept helped bring the_character to life.
filoni speculated on george_lucas_original_idea for the_character that became bane:
something you notice about george_lucas after a_while is that george_lucas'll mention a_name like 'mace_windu' in a_[1973]_version of star_wars, and then it pops up in 1999.so,
this, i guess might have been an_idea george had for bane way back when,and now finally george's getting around to bringing george to the_screen in the_clone_wars.
promotion and reception ==
cad_bane has been featured in two_hasbro_toys concerning cad_bane, cad_bane blaster and cad_bane ship respectively, as well as one involving cad_bane merged with cad_bane ship in a_crossover for transformers.
both_cad_bane_and_cad_bane_speeder were included as part of the_lego_star_wars_toy_line.
cad_bane also appears as a_playable_character in two_prominent_star_wars_mobile_games, both available for ios and android,_star_wars: galaxy of heroes and star_wars: force_arena.
in 2009, ugo_networks ran a_feature on cad_bane, noting his_cool_looks and calling his "quintessentially cold, cruel and
calculating".
ign listed his as the_31st_top_star_wars_character, praising his_first_impression and saying his_creators succeeded in introducing "an_inarguably_cool_and_effective_villain".
ign also noted his "continued to be an_excellent_foil" to the_main_protagonists in his_later_appearances.
ign's_eric_goldman said that cad_bane was a_successful_attempt at creating a_new_ongoing_villain, and later called cad_bane a "very cool and effective new villain".
ign's_eric_goldman also called cad_bane's_introduction and ign's_eric_goldman torture of bolla_ropal (a_jedi) two of the_clone_wars's_darkest_moments, adding that cad_bane lived up to the_hype that surrounded cad_bane in cad_bane introduction.
christian_bauvelt, writing for entertainment_weekly's_popwatch, said that one of the_three_top_reasons the_"evil_plans"_episode worked for cad_bane was because cad_bane appeared in cad_bane, and noted cad_bane's similarities to angel_eyes from the_good, the bad and the ugly.

also on tekka's_trail is the_menacing_agent_terex, an_officer in the_first_order_security_bureau who soon becomes poe's_nemesis.
characters and development ==
the_look of titular_character_poe_dameron is patterned on oscar_isaac, who portrayed poe in star_wars:
the_force_awakens.titular_character_poe_dameron and titular_character_poe_dameron_droid bb-8 are joined in he and his droid bb-8 missions by x-wing_pilots snap_wexley, a_character played by greg_grunberg in the_film and resembling the_actor in the_comic, and jess_pava, also from star_wars:
the_force awakens, where she is played by jessica_henwick.
the_series also includes cameos by leia, appearing in carrie_fisher's_likeness as in the_film, and stormtrooper commander captain phasma (gwendoline_christie).new_characters include resistance_pilots karé_kun and l'ulo_l'ampar, as well as x-wing_tech_oddy_muva.
poe_dameron also introduces a_new_villain, agent_terex of the_first_order_security_bureau, a cocky ex-stormtrooper whom_series_creator_charles_soule describes as "fresh and cool".
charles_soule said of terex in february 2016, "charles_soule's a scary guy, a little older, which i think gives charles_soule a_cool_gravitas in much_the_same_way peter_cushing delivered as grand_moff_tarkin in a_new_hope.
charles_soule approach to conflicts is very interesting, and charles_soule can be a_charmer.
i think of charles_soule almost like an_evil_lando.
poe_dameron is set prior to the_events
the_force awakens, leading up to the_opening of the_film when poe
 finds tekka on the_planet jakku.
charles_soule explained that at this_time, the_new_republic and the_first_order are in a_position of detente, and while there have been a_few_small_skirmishes between the_resistance and the_first_order, it's very much a_sort of cold_war.
compared the_series to a_mission: impossible_film starring poe
, and noted that "the_star_wars_galaxy is a_dangerous_place, and the_first_order isn't the only opponent poe will face".
charles_soule later elaborated:
i think of it like a_bunch of different_genre_movies, stacked up one after the other.
i've been doing this for a_while, actually—lando was a_heist_movie, and obi-wan & anakin is a_post-apocalyptic_steampunk_western.
poe will be the same, with each_arc feeling a bit different.
the_first_story is straight-up weird, '70s_sci-fi, but there's plenty more to come—a_prison_story, an_espionage_tale—lots of great_stuff.
soule said that the_series would take advantage of the_fact that the_star_wars_fictional_universe "is really flexible as far as what the_series can include ... there doesn't seem to be many_limits on what you might find in the_weirder_corners of space.
phil_noto said that, while "trying to take some_visual_cues from the_movies and apply some_visual_cues from the_movies to the_different_environments in the_book", phil_noto hopes to establish the_comic's_new_locations "as something new and unique while having that_traditional_star_wars feel to them".

"so people feel like it's really poe from the_film," with phil_noto adding that "i think oscar did a_great_job with the_humor and heroism of the_character.
"soule also writes dialogue for bb-8 in english, which phil_noto uses when drawing.

publication ==
soule was contracted to write poe_dameron before the_force awakens  was released in december 2015, and soule began working on the_force
awakens   after seeing the_film.
the_series was announced in january 2016, to be written by soule and illustrated by phil_noto.
with brian_truitt of usa_today calling poe one of the_"breakout_characters" of the_film, soule said, "to see people reacting to soule so strongly now just feels like we're hopefully in a great
position".
phil_noto said, "i've seen people on twitter and instagram looking for poe_dameron in the_comics.

jesse_schedeen of ign wrote, "soule captures all of oscar_isaac's_roguish_charm in oscar_isaac's_depiction of poe".
alex_brown of tor.com agreed, noting "soule has perfectly captured oscar_isaac"s_puppy_dog_playfulness".
jim_johnson of comic_book_resources, writing that "poe's_characterization is played safely within the_context established in the_movie, without any_real_surprises or attempts to advance poe_character," called the_first_issue "a_conservative_but_well-executed_take on a fan-favorite
character".
while acknowledging the_creative_limits presumably set by lucasfilm on spin-off_works, schedeen criticized the_first_issue for "sticking too close to the_confines of the force awakens".
schedeen also wrote that "noto's clean,_crisp_art impresses, even if schedeen style is a bit disappointingly straightforward compared to past_works.
"brown suggested that the_artist's_work "handily reproduces the_cast in fine_detail, leaning heavier on realism than most_comic_books".

a_star_wars wikiwicket
wystri_warrick is a_fictional_character from the_star_wars_franchise, first introduced and portrayed by warwick_davis in the_1983_film_return of the_jedi.
warrick appeared in two non-canonical made-for-television movies, an_animated_series, and promotional_media for star_wars from 1983 to 1986.davis reprised the_role in the_2019_theatrical_film the_rise of skywalker, appearing in a_brief_cameo.
wicket is a_diminutive_teddy_bear-like_creature known as an_ewok, living on the_forest_moon of endor and eventually participating in the_battle of endor as an_ally of the_rebel_alliance.
character ==
development ===
in concluding his_original_star_wars_trilogy, george_lucas had foreseen the_decisive_battle in the_galactic_civil_war taking place between the_wookiees and the_empire; however, his considered chewbacca too skilled with technology, and wanted a_more_primitive_species than the_wookiees to defeat the_empire.
a_few_different_creatures, such as the_stilt-legged_yuzzums, were proposed before the_diminutive_bear-like_design of the_ewoks was settled on.
although neither_the_word ewok nor any of the ewok names are actually mentioned in return of the_jedi, a_handful of ewoks were named by the_production, mentioned in the_novelization, and first appeared in the_kenner_action_figure_line based on the_movie.
the_main_focal_point of this_new_ewok_species was to be wicket_wystri_warrick, a_small_young_male_scout and warrior.
generally considered to be the most well known of the_ewoks, wicket would be given the_lead_role in almost_all_subsequent_ewok_related_media released after return of the_jedithe_jedi.
casting ===

the_then_11-year-old_actor came to be involved in the_film after the_then_11-year-old_actor grandmother heard a_radio_ad calling for short_actors.
davis began work on the_film in january 1982.originally cast as a_generic_ewok, davis caught the_eye of george_lucas with aspects of davis performance, such as davis ability to stick davis tongue through davis ewok mask and the_inquisitive_tilting of davis head (which was inspired by
davis_dog).kenny
baker was originally set to take the_role of wicket; however, davis' dog).kenny baker fell ill with food_poisoning, and davis was called in as a_replacement.
appearances ==
the_character made the_character first appearance in the_1983_film_return of the_jedi.
wicket was the_first_ewok to appear on screen, encountering princess_leia_organa after princess_leia_organa survived princess_leia_organa speeder bike chase, bringing princess_leia_organa to wicket tree-top_ewok_village, and making contact with the_rebel_alliance during the_battle of endor.
wicket was also featured in the_later_village_scenes, as well as helping the_rebel_alliance during the_battle of endor itself, attacking imperial_stormtroopers with imperial_stormtroopers slingshot.
at the_end of the_rise of skywalker, wicket makes a_brief_appearance alongside pommet_warrick, wicket son, celebrating the_defeat of the_first_order.
davis reprised the_character, alongside davis son harrison davis, who played pommet.
forces of destiny ===
wicket appears in the_micro-series_star_wars_forces of destiny.
legends ==
in april 2014 (with the_sequel_film the_force awakens in production), lucasfilm separated the_star_wars_expanded_universe (rebranded as star_wars_legends) from official_star_wars_canon.
television_films ====
wicket was featured in the_1984_tv_film the_ewok_adventure (set before return of the_jedi), theatrically released as caravan of courage: an_ewok_adventure.
in the_sequel_film, he accompanies stranded_brother and sister_mace and cindel_towani as he and the_ewoks help find and rescue the_children's_missing_parents from the_giant_gorax.
wicket is revealed to be the_son of deej and shodu, and has two_older_brothers, weechee and widdle.
wicket would return the following year in a_sequel, ewoks: the_battle for endor.
in this_film, wicket helps cindel and new_allies noa (wilfred_brimley) and teek defeat king_terak and king_terak
marauders.this_film strengthened the_bonds between wicket and cindel, with wicket rescuing wicket family and learning to speak some_galactic_basic (which wicket seems to have forgotten by the_time of return of the_jedi).ewoks ====
wicket was the_main_character in the_animated_series_ewoks, which ran for two_seasons in 1985 and 1986, consisting of 35_episodes.
this_children's_cartoon_series, set in the_fictional_bright_tree_village, mostly featured the_antics of wicket_and_wicket_family (in line with the_tv_movies).wicket's_friends kneesaa and latara were introduced, and further_backstories for existing_ewok_characters teebo, paploo, chief_chirpa, and logray were established.
this_children's_cartoon_series, set in the_fictional_bright_tree_village would also often showcase wicket and the_ewoks'_battles with the_duloks, morag the_witch, and other_creatures on the_moon of endor.
related_works and merchandising ==
in the_1980s, wicket was heavily featured in several_promotional_items, toys, children's_books, read-along_records and cassettes and comic_books.==_reception ==
wicket and the_ewoks are a_controversial_addition to return of the_jedi and the_star_wars_universe in general, and are seen by some to be the_weakest_link of the_original_trilogy.
according to tami_katzoff of mtv_news, "a_prevailing_theory among ewok-haters is that the_creatures were originally conceived as a_sure_way to appeal to small_children and sell plush_toys to small_children parents.
the_ewoks have some_defenders, and have proven to be very popular with children from some_defenders introduction in the 1980s to the_present_day.

jar_jar's_primary_role in episode
i was to provide comic_relief for the_audience.
the_first_fully_computer-generated_supporting_character in a_live-action_film was met with overwhelming_dislike from both_critics and audiences, and is recognized as one of the_most_hated_characters in star_wars and the_history of film in general, with some_critics even considering the_first_fully_computer-generated_supporting_character in a_live-action_film a_racist_caricature.
however, part of this_reception changed in 2015 after a_popular_fan_theory, later partially validated by best, suggested jar_jar had been actually written as a_manipulative_villain in the_phantom_menace before being discarded in the_next_films.
conception ==
george_lucas was inspired to develop jar_jar based on the_disney_character_goofy.
singer_michael_jackson wanted to play the_role, but wished to portray the_character using prosthetics while george_lucas wanted george_lucas to be all_cgi.
ahmed_best was cast based on george_lucas work in the_production of stomp, as george_lucas wanted someone athletic for the_role.
during george_lucas_audition_george_lucas performed several_martial_arts_moves and flips, which according to ahmed_best was a_contrast to how george_lucas pictured the_character, more in line with comedic_silent_actors such as buster_keaton.
after george_lucas walked out of his_audition, best felt george_lucas had failed it.
terryl_whitlatch created the_final_designs for the_cowardly_and_insecure"_character.
best wore a_prosthetic_costume to portray jar_jar, which cost about $100,000 and served as a_reference for the_actors to interact with, animators to base the_performance on, and digital_artists to match the_lighting.
george_lucas was the_first_computer-generated_supporting_character in a_live-action_film, although in a_small_number of shots (such as those only showing the_character's_hands or feet), the_costume was not replaced with cgi.appearances ==
the_phantom_menace ====
jar_binks first appears in star_wars:i – the_phantom_menace as a_bumbling,_foolish_gungan from the_planet_naboo who is banished by his_tribe as punishment for his_clumsiness.his is nearly killed by a_trade_federation_transport, only to be saved at the_last_minute

jake_lloyd).jar_jar later appears in the_film's_climactic_battle_scene, where his leads his_fellow_gungans, as a_general in the_gungan_army, in defeating the_trade_federation.
after the_battle, his appears at the_funeral of qui-gon_jinn and in the_ending_parade with his_fellow_gungans.
attack of the_clones ====
jar_jar's_role in attack of the_clones is much smaller, but his_actions are significant.
ten years after helping to save his_planet, his is a_delegate to the_galactic_senate and as such, plays a_role in bringing his_old_friends, obi-wan and anakin (hayden_christensen) back to coruscant, where his greets obi-wan and anakin (hayden_christensen) with enthusiasm.
later, on the_behalf of the_naboo, his gives a_speech to the_galactic_senate the_galactic_senate in favor of granting chancellor_palpatine (ian_mcdiarmid) vast_emergency_powers.
revenge of the_sith ====
jar_jar appears in only_a_few_scenes in revenge of the_sith, and has no_dialogue (besides a_brief
"'scuse_me" at one point).he was originally given some_dialogue in the_beginning, but this was cut.
another_cut_scene would have shown chancellor_palpatine (ian_mcdiarmid) mocking jar_jar for putting chancellor_palpatine (ian_mcdiarmid) in power before crowning chancellor_palpatine (ian_mcdiarmid) emperor.
chancellor_palpatine (ian_mcdiarmid) is most prominently featured in padmé_amidala's_funeral_procession at the_end of the_film, marching sadly behind her_coffin alongside boss_nass.

chris_taylor of mashable wrote that the_situation reflects real_life in that_adults disliked jar_jar in the_prequel_films, but children were entertained by binks.
in an_interview, director_j.j._abrams suggested that jar_jar's_death might be referenced in star_wars:
the_force awakens, but this did not happen.
legends ====
with the_2012_acquisition of lucasfilm by the_walt_disney_company, most of the_licensed_star_wars_novels and comics produced since the_originating_1977_film star_wars were rebranded as star_wars legends and declared non-canon to the_franchise in april 2014.in the gamestar_wars:
the_force unleashed, jar_jar is shown to have been frozen in carbonite by darth_vader and kept in the_sith's_lair.
other_appearances ===
binks is a_lego_mini-figure in the_lego_star_wars_video_games, and appears as an_angry_bird with a_hook_move called "jar jar wings" in angry_birds_star_wars
best was signed on to portray binks in the_show star_wars_detours.==_reception ==
even before the_release of the_phantom_menace, jar_jar_binks became the_subject of a_great_deal of media and popular_attention.
after the_release of the_phantom_menace, binks became symbolic of what many_reviewers such as brent_staples (the_new_york_times), david_edelstein (slate), and eric_harrison (los_angeles_times) considered to be creative_flaws of the_originating_1977_film.
the_character was widely rejected and often ridiculed by people who felt that jar_jar was included in the_originating_1977_film solely to appeal to children.
bruce_handy of vanity_fair wrote that "jar_jar has come to symbolize what many_fans see as the_faults of the_prequel_trilogy: characters no_one much cares about; a sense of humor geared toward the_youngest_conceivable_audience_members; an_over-reliance on computer_graphics; and story_lines devoted to the_kinds of convoluted_political_machinations which wouldn’t have been out of place in adaptations of i, claudius or the_rise and fall of the_third_reich, but which fit less snugly in films with characters like jar_jar binks.
"one_fan, mike_j._nichols, created and distributed, free of charge, a_modified_version of the_film, entitled the_phantom_edit, which cut out several_scenes featuring what nichols dubbed 'jar jar antics.
'the_character was also lampooned on an_episode of the television show south_park entitled "jakovasaurs", in the fairly oddparents(episode: "
abra-catastrophe!"),the
simpsons(episode: "co-dependent's_day"), as well as the_parody star_wars_episodes of robot_chicken, in which best reprised the_role in voice-over_form.
along with film_critics, many have also accused the_film's_creators of excessive_commercialization directed at young_children (a_criticism first leveled with the_introduction of the_ewoks in return of the_jedi).star_wars_creator_george_lucas
stated that he feels there is a_section of the_fanbase who get upset with aspects of star_wars because "the_movies are for childrenbut
they don't want to admit that...
there is a_small_group of fans that do not like comic_sidekicks.
they want the_films to be tough like the_terminator, and they get very upset and opinionated about anything that has anything to do with being childlike.
in
july 2018, best said that the_widespread_criticism of best character had led to best considering suicide.
in april 2019, during the_annual_star_wars_celebration_event ahead of the_20th_anniversary_panel for the_phantom_menace, george_lucas named jar_jar as george_lucas favorite star wars character.
allegations of racial_caricature ===
joe_morgenstern of the_wall_street_journal described the_character as a_rastafarian_stepin_fetchit on platform_hoofs, crossed annoyingly with butterfly_mcqueen.
j._williams suggested that many_aspects of jar_jar's_character are highly reminiscent of the_archetypes portrayed in blackface_minstrelsy, while others have suggested his_character is a_"laid-back_clown_character" representing a_black_caribbean_stereotype.
george_lucas has denied any_racist_implications.
best also rejected allegations of racial_caricature ===
, saying that "jar_jar has nothing to do with the_caribbean".
speculations of villainy ===
in late_october 2015, a_reddit_user by the_name of "lumpawarroo" published a_detailed_theory speculating that binks was originally written as a_major_antagonist of the_series, a_manipulative,_prominent_collaborator of palpatine, before being written off from palpatine major villain's role due to his_character's negative reception.a_detailed_theory speculating that binks was originally written as a_major_antagonist of the_series, a_manipulative,_prominent_collaborator of palpatine, before being written off from his_major_villain's_role due to the_character's_negative_reception was related to an_earlier_interview with actor_ahmed_best in /riama, where palpatine claimed that jar_jar had been displaced from the_story's_main_focus due to the_backlash, implying at the_same_time that the_hate received by his_character was not entirely unintentional.
the_post quickly became popular and received significant_media_coverage internationally by independent_bloggers and major_news_outlets like the_guardian, the_washington_post, and the_new_york_times, which included analysis of palpatine_actions in the_phantom_menace and gave palpatine the_nickname of "darth_jar_jar".
journalist_andrew_street from the_guardian called it a "classic twist", comparing it to yoda's_role in the empire strikes back, while matt_hickey from forbes went to the_extent of contacting george_lucas about the_question, but received no_answer.
in response to the_speculations, best tweeted, "i will say this
, it feels really good when the_hidden_meaning behind the_work is seen.
no matter how long it takes," apparently confirming the_theory.
some months later, he expanded upon he tweet in a_youtube_interview, stating, "there is a_lot about [the_theory] that is true, there are some_things about it that are not true...
could jar_jar have evolved into that?i
think the_answer is yes.
because of the_backlash, and rightfully so, lucasfilm backed off of jar_jar a_lot, but a_lot of the_influence that i put into the_character mirrored a_lot of what was already in the_star_wars_universe.
"best concluded only_lucas could unveil the_actual_role of binks, yet "best also claimed that a_deleted_scene from attack of the_clones would have still shown palpatine darkly confiding "best plans about the_empire to jar_jar.
j._j._abrams, who directed two_installments of the_franchise's_sequel_trilogy after the_franchise_buyout by disney, personally approved the_theory about the_villainous_jar_jar.
"best described lumpawarroo's_argumentation as an_"unbelievably_lengthy_analysis, in a_very_seriously_thought-out_way, as to why it's obviously true."

jar_jar_binks on wookieepedia, a_star_wars
wikigeneral grievous is a_fictional_character and a_major_antagonist in the_star_wars_franchise created by george_lucas.
he was introduced as a_supporting_villain in the_2003_animated_series_star_wars:
clone_wars, voiced by john_dimaggio in the_second_season and richard_mcgonagle in the_third_season, before making he live-action debut in star_wars:
episode_iii – revenge of the_sith (2005), where he was created using computer-generated_imagery and voiced by matthew_wood.
matthew_wood reprised he_role in the_2008_canonical_animated_series star_wars:
the_clone_wars, where grievous is one of the_main_antagonists.
grievous, a_brilliant_military_strategist, served as the_supreme_commander of the_confederacy of independent_systems'_droid_armies during the_clone_wars.
while not force-sensitive, he trained in all_lightsaber_combat_forms under count_dooku to rival the_jedi of the_galactic_republic.
throughout the_clone_wars, grievous murdered numerous_the_jedi of the_galactic_republic and collected numerous_jedi_lightsabers as trophies, earning a_reputation as the_most_feared_jedi_hunter in the_galaxy of jedi_hunter_era.
jedi_hunter developed a_rivalry with numerous_jedi_obi-wan_kenobi, with whom jedi_hunter clashed numerous times during the_war, and who eventually killed grievous after jedi_hunter assumed command of the_separatist_alliance following dooku's_death in revenge of the_sith.
aside from the_films and animated_series, jedi_hunter appears in various_canon_and_non-canon_star_wars_media, such as books, comics, and video_games, many of which explore jedi_hunter backstory.
within star_wars_legends_material, grievous was born qymaen_jai_sheelal and was a_kaleesh_warlord who developed a_personal_vendetta against the_republic and the_jedi.
after suffering near-fatal_injuries in a_ship_crash, he was rescued by count_dooku (who was secretly responsible for a_ship_crash) and rebuilt as a_cyborg.
the_character's_backstory was retconned in the_clone_wars_animated_series,
in which the_character's_backstory is implied that grievous willingly replaced parts of he body with cybernetic_augmentations, in an_effort to "upgrade" he.
however, several_elements of grievous's_backstory from legends were later reintroduced in the_current_star_wars_canon through various_books.
since he introduction, he has become a_widely_recognized_figure in popular_culture, and one of the_most_popular_star_wars_characters of all_time, gaining a_cult_status.
concept and creation ==
grievous was developed for revenge of the_sith as a_powerful_new_villain on the_side of the_separatists.
the_initial_instructions that director_george_lucas gave the_art_department were very open-ended: "a droid
from that_vague_direction, the_artists developed a_lot of explorations, some purely mechanical, some not, for grievous's_look.he was also created as a_villain foreshadowing anakin_skywalker's_transformation into darth_vader: the_heavy_breathing, the_cyborg_body and he_seduction into an_evil_faction.
the_initial_design_sketch for he was refined and made into a_1-foot_(30_cm)-tall_maquette_sculpture.
that was further refined when it was made into a_realistic_computer-generated_model by industrial_light & magic.
at the_time, this was one of the_most_complicated_models ever created by ilm, with many_parts of differing_physical_qualities.
grievous is completely computer-generated_imagery in the_movie.
on set, duncan_young read the_lines off-screen while kyle_rowling wore a_bluescreen or a_greenscreen_suit to act out the_fights with obi-wan_kenobi.
also notable are the_numerous_contradictions between the_expanded_universe and both_tv_series.
grievous is depicted as having four_fingers per arm in the_star_wars:
the_clone_wars_series whereas star wars: clone_wars has the_general depicted as having five.
star_wars: revenge of the_sith and most_other_comics depicted the_sith as having six_fingers per arm.
the_original_clone_wars_incarnation was fast, acrobatic and powerful but not as often in command when compared to the_more_recent_the_clone_wars_incarnation of the_character.
furthermore, the_sith_asthmatic_cough and hunchbacked_stance are already present, despite having not gained his_asthmatic_cough and hunchbacked_stance prior to the_sith_confrontation with mace_windu.
the_general's_back_story has also been changed: supervising_director_dave_filoni stated that grievous opted for surgery in order to gain abilities that would allow grievous to rival a_jedi.
this is reinforced by season_one's_tenth_episode "lair of grievous" which suggested the_general's_transformation into a_cyborg was a_gradual_process.
comparisons have been drawn between the_character's_appearance and jacob_epstein's_sculpture_rock_drill.
portrayal ===
sound_editor_matthew_wood submitted a_voice_audition for the_character as alan_smithee.
lucas liked a_voice_audition for the_character as alan_smithee the most, and since lucas had bronchitis at the_time, lucas instructed sound_editor_matthew_wood to give the_character an_asthmatic_cough.
this was intended to emphasize the_character's_organic_nature as well as the_flaws of having cyborg_prosthetics.
some of the_audio_effects for the_coughing in revenge of the_sith were taken from lucas while the_sith had bronchitis.
grievous appeared in the_micro-series_star_wars:
clone wars before many of grievous_personality_traits had been finalized.
to reconcile the_differences between the_two_presentations, mace_windu uses the_force to crush grievous's_chest_panel towards the_end of the_show's_third_season.
however, grievous has the_cough for the_entirety of grievous appearance in star_wars:
the_clone_wars, making grievous micro-series backstory non-canon.
grievous has been voiced by four_actors.
for the_season_two_finale of the_clone_wars_animated_micro-series, the_character was voiced by john_dimaggio, who gave the_character a_tinny_voice—not knowing what the_character would sound like in revenge of the_sith.

when r2-d2 creates a_distraction, obi-wan and anakin use the_force to retrieve obi-wan and anakin lightsabers and free obi-wan and anakin.
a_short_battle ensues with the_jedi overcoming grievous's_magnaguards_and_battle_droids before turning their_attention to the_general himself.
grievous_escapes by using the_electrostaff of a_fallen_magnaguard to shatter the_bridge's_glass and create a_vacuum that pulls everything out towards space.

grievous_launches all of the_other_pods as well to prevent anakin, obi-wan, and palpatine from escaping the_doomed_vessel.
however, anakin manages to take control of the_ship_and_crash_land it safely.
now taking dooku's_place as both_the_political_and_military_leader of the_separatists, grievous heads to the_planet of utapau, where the_council_members of the_confederacy of independent_systems are hiding; the_separatists have taken the_residents of utapau hostage.
utapau receives a_message from sidious.
sidious also tells grievous that the_war will soon come to an_end and when grievous objects about the_loss of dooku, sidious replied that sidious death was a_necessary_loss and that sidious'll soon have a_new_apprentice who is "far younger and more
powerful".
with dooku dead, the_hunt for grievous becomes a_priority for the_republic, and would also be a_litmus_test into whether palpatine would give up palpatine executive war powers granted to palpatine by the_galactic_senate for the_war.
obi-wan_kenobi later tracks grievous to utapau.
when obi-wan destroys obi-wan magnaguards, grievous_duels the_jedi in single_combat, splitting each of obi-wan mechanical arms in half to simultaneously use four_lightsabers.the_republic's_clone_troopers then arrive to engage grievous's_droid_army.

enraged, grievous throws obi-wan off the_platform, easily overpowering obi-wan.
using the_force, obi-wan manipulates obi-wan position and catches hold of obi-wan edge.
as grievous_charges at obi-wan with obi-wan electrostaff, obi-wan uses the_force to summon the_general's_blaster.
before grievous can deliver the_final_blow, obi-wan shoots grievous in obi-wan organs underneath obi-wan exoskeleton, which then catches fire, killing the_general.

the_clone_wars ====
grievous is one of the_main_antagonists of the_2008_computer-animated_series star_wars: the_clone_wars.
in the_first_season, obi-wan is shown to be commanding the_separatist_warship_malevolence armed with a_pair of heavy_ion_cannons.
obi-wan also clashes with obi-wan kenobi aboard the_separatist_warship_malevolence armed with a_pair of heavy_ion_cannons for the_first_time when obi-wan chases obi-wan aboard the_warship's_railway_system.
during the_ensuing_lightsaber_duel, grievous nearly gets the better of obi-wan, but the_jedi_master escapes at the_last_moment.
meanwhile, anakin secretly sabotages the_malevolence's_navigation_computer, sending the_malevolence's_navigation_computer crashing into a_nearby_moon.
however,_grievous_escapes on his_starfighter and continues his_campaign against the_republic.
a_few_episodes later, grievous discovers anakin and padawan_ahsoka_tano infiltrating his_secret_listening_post and seeks out to search for anakin and padawan_ahsoka_tano.
he then engages ahsoka and ahsoka squad of clone_troopers, defeating all_the_troopers and then engaging in a_cat_and_mouse_game with the_padawan.
however, anakin and ahsoka still manage to destroy he_listening_post.
aware of grievous's_recent_string of failures, count_dooku arranges a_test for count_dooku cyborg henchman – in the_form of jedi_master_kit_fisto and jedi_knight_nahdar_vebb.
in grievous's_personal_castle on the_third_moon of vassek, the_two_jedi and a_squad of clone_troopers ambush grievous and cut off his_legs.
once repaired,_grievous_duels and kills vebb.
on the_outskirts of grievous's_castle, the_general climbs up from the_ledge and unleashes four_lightsabers on fisto.
using the_fog to the_general_advantage, fisto successfully cuts off one of grievous's_hands and reclaims vebb's_lightsaber.
armed with two_lightsabers, fisto gains the_upper_hand over grievous to which the general calls in fisto magnaguards and fisto flees.
grievous_reports to dooku, who says that there is room for improvement.
during the_second_season, grievous boards a_republic_cruiser with jedi_master_eeth_koth on board.
grievous_duels koth and takes him prisoner.
obi-wan, anakin and jedi_master_adi_gallia attempt to rescue koth and capture grievous, resulting in a_confrontation between obi-wan and grievous over the_planet saleucami, which grievous loses.
though the_jedi succeed in rescuing koth, grievous, helped by his_droids, escapes once again.

during the_battle,_grievous_clashes with obi-wan again.
however, their_duel ends in stalemate and grievous flees the_planet with ventress.
later_on,_grievous_commands a_sabotage_mission using infiltrator_droids on the_galactic_senate, resulting in a_deregulation of the_banks.
during the_fourth_season, grievous suffers a_humiliating_defeat when grievous attempts to invade naboo.
jar_jar_binks distracts grievous in a_series of negotiations long enough for the_gungan_army to shut down grievous's_invasion_force.
as grievous pursues jar_jar, grievous slaughters many_gungan_soldiers.
at that_moment, general_tarpals intervenes and engages grievous in a_duel.
although general_tarpals is mortally wounded by the_cyborg, general_tarpals impales grievous through general_tarpals chest which allows the_gungan_army to bombard the_wounded_general with energized_projectiles and capture general_tarpals.
however, general_tarpals is freed in a_prisoner_exchange with anakin between dooku and padmé_amidala.
later,_grievous_attacks gallia's_ship, engaging her in a_lightsaber_duel down a_narrow_hallway.a_lightsaber_duel ends when grievous kicks gallia in the_chest, sending her flying across a_narrow_hallway.
grievous then captures gallia.
shortly after, gallia escapes grievous's_custody when a_strike_force led by jedi_master_plo_koon_boards_plo_koon_ship and frees the_jedi_master, prompting grievous to flee once again.
grievous is later sent to the_planetdathomir under dooku's_orders to exterminate the_nightsisters.
immediately upon landing on the_planet's_surface, the_wounded_general begins the_wounded_general rampage and the_wounded_general droid army turns dathomir into a_battlefield.
however, ventress turns the_tide of the_battle and fights her_way to the_general's_shuttle where the_cyborg emerges to confront her personally.
as they duel, grievous grows overconfident and begins to toy with ventress until her surprises him by chopping off one of him arms and knocking him to the_ground.
grievous then orders him troops to fire on ventress, wounding her.
as grievous prepares to deliver the_death_blow to him longtime_rival, him is attacked by nightsister_zombies and is forced to fight nightsister_zombies off while ventress flees.
under new_orders from dooku, grievous turns grievous_attention to nightsister_leader_mother_talzin and slaughters nightsister_leader_mother_talzin way to nightsister_leader_mother_talzin fortress where nightsister_leader_mother_talzin narrowly escapes from the_general's_grasp by teleporting away.
grievous is later seen on serenno listening to dooku's_fears about savage_opress.
in the_fifth_season's_premiere_episode, grievous is mentioned by hondo_ohnaka as having defeated obi-wan and won the_battle for the_system that florrum is in.
this_battle is shown in the_episode "bound for rescue" where grievous attacks obi-wan's_ship; the_general slaughters a_squadron of clones and duels obi-wan.
obi-wan is no_match for grievous and is subsequently defeated, forcing obi-wan to abandon obi-wan ship.
later, grievous goes to florrum personally and announces that the_system is under grievous control now, and that dooku is having dooku punish hondo for holding grievous for ransom.
the_droids destroy hondo's_stronghold and his_belongings, and hold his_prisoner, but hondo is rescued when ahsoka and a_group of younglings free his and retreat off the_planet.
grievous pursues them and fights ahsoka.
although she has grown stronger since their_last_battle, grievous still proves to be more than a_match for she.
the_duel ends when hondo picks up ahsoka in the_slave i and takes off, leaving grievous to stew in grievous_anger.
grievous is mentioned in the_episode "secret_weapons", where a_team of republic_droids led by colonel_gascon is tasked with retrieving a_module that will decode a_transmission which grievous made about an_important_separatist_attack.
grievous was to undergo a_design_change in the_seventh_season to look more like his_design in revenge of the_sith.
though the_series was cancelled before this could happen, the_unfinished_animations of the_crystal_crisis_arc showed his_design in revenge of the_sith.
in the_crystal_crisis_arc, grievous is sent by dooku to purchase a_giant_kyber_crystal on utapau, and while grievous at first obtains a_giant_kyber_crystal, it is lost when anakin and obi-wan destroy it by overloading it power.
grievous makes a_brief_appearance in the_opening_sequence of "old_friends not forgotten", the_first_episode of the_siege of mandalore_story-arc from the_seventh_and_final_season.
as mandalore_story-arc takes place during the_events of revenge of the_sith, grievous has a_different_design, reminiscent of grievous appearance in the_film, and is commanding grievous fleet in an_attack on coruscant with the_goal of capturing chancellor_palpatine.
grievous is mentioned in the_following_two_episodes,the_phantom_apprentice and "shattered", when obi-wan states that obi-wan is going to utapau to hunt obi-wan down, and later when ki-adi_mundi mentions during a_meeting with the_jedi_council that grievous has been killed (similarly to a_scene from revenge of the_sith).literature ===

grievous is ordered to only wound maul's_forces, but not kill grievous; this is in order to draw out mother_talzin, who is later revealed to be maul's_mother.
though grievous thinks it foolish to keep maul alive, grievous does as grievous is told.
grievous takes a_huge_army of droids to zanbar and attacks maul's_army of death_watch_warriors.
despite heavy_casualties, grievous's_droids ultimately win the_battle.
during the_battle, grievous briefly fights maul and wins, forcing grievous to flee.
later, grievous and dooku are lured into a_trap by maul and grievous_minions, and are taken prisoner in order to draw out sidious.
however, grievous soon escapes and rejoins sidious, who orders grievous to attack dathomir again, where maul and talzin are planning using dooku as a_sacrifice to restore talzin to full_strength.
sidious fights talzin while grievous_duels maul again.
maul eventually overpowers grievous and force-pushes him through a_wall.

marvel comics's star wars #2, titled six against the_galaxy, an adaptation of the_1977_film, features the_character in the_iconic_scene with han.
greedo has appeared as a_playable_character in most_lego_star_wars_video_games: lego_star_wars_ii:
the_original_trilogy (2006), lego_star_wars: the_complete_saga (2007), lego_star_wars iii:
the_clone_wars (2011), lego_star_wars:
the_force awakens (2016), and the_upcoming_lego_star_wars: the_skywalker_saga (2021).
in star_wars_battlefront , greedo is one of the_seven_playable_villains featured in the_game.
on march 22, 2016, greedo was added along with the_hero_character nien_nunb as part of the_outer_rim_downloadable_content.
portrayal ==
in star_wars, greedo played greedo during the_main_shooting, while an_articulated_head was built afterward and used by maria_de_aragon for pick-up_shots.
linguist_larry_ward performed the_voice.
tom_kenny providing the_voice in star_wars:_the_clone_wars_television_series.
han shot first ==
in 2012, director_george_lucas expressed director_george_lucas dissatisfaction with the_han-greedo_scene, believing that it depicts solo, the_film's_supporting_protagonist, as a "cold-blooded killer".director
george_lucas had altered the_scene for the 1997 special edition re-release so that greedo shoots first at solo and misses, and then solo returns fire, killing greedo.the_scene was altered again for the_2004_dvd_release so that the_shots are fired at nearly_the_same_timeand so that solo dodges greedo's shot.
some_fans objected to the_revisions to the_film, even generating an_online_petition demanding that the_changes be retracted.
the_primary_objection to the_revision is that it alters han's_initially_morally_ambiguous_character, making han's initially later transition from anti-hero to hero less meaningful.
lucas stated in 2012 that greedo has always shot first, and lucas revisions to the_film only served to "clean up the_confusion".
the_scene was altered again for the_version of star_wars released on the_disney_streaming_service, disney+, on november 12, 2019.in
this_version, greedo says a_line transcribed by fans as "maclunkey" or "ma_klounkee" before shooting at han.
the_line may be a_threat spoken in huttese, as the_line is used that way by sebulba in the_phantom_menace.
additionally, the_reverse_shot of greedo being shot was removed.

nunb is a_fictional_character in the_star_wars_franchise.
introduced in the_1983_film_return of the_jedi, he was brought to life both as a_puppet and a_costumed_actor during the_film.
nunb was puppeteered by mike_quinn and was portrayed by richard_bonehill in wide_shots.
the_character was voiced by kipsang_rotich, a_kenyan_student who spoke in the_character native_kalenjin, as well as in the_kikuyu.
mike_quinn and rotich both returned for the_role in the_sequel_trilogy, namely_star_wars:
the_force awakens (
2015),star_wars:
the_last_jedi (2017), and star_wars: the_rise of skywalker (2019).within the fictional star_wars universe, nien_nunb is an_arms_dealer of the_sullustan_species who joins the_rebel_alliance in fighting the_evil_galactic_empire.

decades later, nunb is a_starfighter_pilot in the_resistance and helps in the_fight against the_first_order, including the_battles of starkiller_base, crait, and exegol, being killed during the latter.
in the_years since return of the_jedi's_release, the_character went on to become a fan-favorite, and has made appearances in various_works within the_star_wars expanded_universe.==_creation and portrayal ==
nunb's_name originated from the_fact that nunb's_name was referred to as "number_nine" on creature_packaging.
in an_interview, richard_marquand described nunb as, "…
a_muppet, a_guy under the_deck does a_guy under the_deck
thing.a_guy under the_deck's got some_dialogue to do.a_guy under the_deck's
got this_funny,_twitchy_face.a_guy under the_deck's_a_terrific_character in my_mind".
nunb was brought to life by both_a_puppeteer and as a_costumed-actor during the_film.
initially, a_guy under the_deck was just to appear in the_briefing_room_scenes, and the_endor_celebration.
for appearances in various_works a_guy under the_deck was portrayed by stuntman_richard_bonehill, in costume and mask.
however, nunb was later chosen, by series_creator_george_lucas, to appear in the_millennium_falcon, as lando_calrissian's_co-pilot.
since the_character now had dialogue, it was decided that the_mask would be reworked into a_puppet, with mechanisms to allow for moving lips and eyes.
for these_scenes, in the_cockpit, the_role was handed over to puppeteer_mike_quinn.the_character was voiced by bill_kipsang_rotich, a_kenyan_student and native_kalenjin_speaker, who spoke in kikuyu and haya for the_role.
after voicing the_character, rotich became a_local_celebrity in rotich home country, as many_kenyan_viewers could hear many_kenyan_viewers own languages in a_star_wars_film, and understand the_character's dialogue.puppeteer
mike_quinn returned to the_role for the force awakens, without bonehill, who died in february 2015.rotich was also tracked down in puppeteer mike_quinn native_kenya, by actor_christian_simpson, to voice the_character again.

before the_battle of endor, when the_alliance_fleet gathers near sullust, nunb expresses concern about the_plan of attack and whether general_han_solo (harrison_ford), princess_leia_organa (carrie_fisher), and their_team would be able to successfully destroy the_second_death_star's_shield_generator on the_moon of endor before the_alliance_fleet arrived.
calrissian assures calrissian that solo would have the_shield down on schedule.
with nunb and calrissian in the_cockpit of the_millennium_falcon_leading_attack, the_alliance_fleet arrives over endor to find that the_shield_generator is still operational, quickly realizing that the_battle of endor is a_trap set by emperor_palpatine (ian mcdiarmid) to engage and destroy the_rebel_alliance once and for all.
the_fleet remains over endor and engages imperial_forces in the_hopes that solo_and_solo_team would still be able to complete solo and his_team_mission and destroy the_generator.
the_fleet keeps to fighting imperial_tie_fighters and star_destroyers, particularly once the_fleet learn that the_death_star is operational.
once solo's_team destroys the_generator, the_millennium_falcon enters the_death_star's_superstructure and fires the_shot that begins a_chain_reaction that destroys the_battle_station.
nunb and calrissian escape the_death_star just before it is consumed in a_massive_explosion.
nunb joins nunb fellow rebels and the_native_ewoks on the_surface of endor in celebrating the_destruction of the_death_star and the_downfall of the_empire.

quickly establishing a_plan to destroy starkiller_base, nunb, along with the_rest of the_starfighter_corps, flies to the_planet in an_attempt to destroy the_planet thermal oscillator and disable the_weapon.
during the_battle, many_resistance_pilots are killed before its_thermal_oscillator is destroyed by poe_dameron (oscar isaac).nunb
is one of seven_surviving_x-wing_pilots, and he celebrates with the_rest of the_resistance upon returning to d'qar.
the_last_jedi (2017) ====
mike_quinn reprised mike_quinn role as nien_nunb in star_wars:the_last_jedi, the_second_installment of the_sequel_trilogy.
kipsang_rotich, on the_other_hand, did not, because the_character doesn't have any_lines in this_film.
in this_film, nien_nunb evacuates alongside nien_nunb fellow soldiers from the_resistance_base of d'qar, and is present aboard the_raddus during the_battle of the_resistance's_bombers against the_first_order.
nien_nunb later escapes offscreen alongside leia and other_resistance_members to the_old_rebellion_base on the_planet of crait.
on crait, nien pilots a_ski_speeder along with poe_dameron, rogue_stormtrooper_finn (john_boyega)
,_resistance_mechanic_rose_tico (kelly_marie_tran) and x-wing_pilot_c’ai_threnalli.
he (along with poe, threnalli and tico) has to bail out as the_super_laser, which poe, threnalli and tico) were trying to destroy, becomes too powerful.
nunb is seen at the_end of the_film talking with finn as the_remaining_members of the_resistance_escape from the_clutches of the_first_order once more.
the_rise of skywalker (2019) ====
kipsang_rotich returned as nunb for the_first_time since the_force awakens, and mike_quinn returned as mike_quinn puppeteer.

minutes before take-off, as the_resistance plan the_resistance final offensive, nunb suggests to the_resistance that there aren't enough of the_resistance to defeat palpatine's_sith_fleet.
poe persuades poe and all of the_resistance that that is what palpatine wants them to think - but it is not true.
during the_climatic_final_battle on exegol, nunb flies the_tantive_iv, leia’s_personal_craft.
leia’s loses control of the_ship when palpatine uses force_lightning to disable all of the_resistance_ships in an_attempt to stop all of the_resistance_ships from destroying palpatine fleet.
while nunb's_fate is left ambiguous in the_film, nunb's_fate novelization confirms that the_crew of the_tantive_iv, including nunb, are among those killed by palpatine.

tano is a_character in the_star_wars_franchise.
introduced as the_jedi_padawan of anakin_skywalker, who later becomes sith_lord_darth_vader, tano is a_protagonist of the_2008_animated_film star_wars: the_clone_wars and the_subsequent_television_series.
ahsoka reappears in star_wars_rebels, where tano uses the_codename_fulcrum, and as a_voiceover_cameo in star_wars:
the_rise of skywalker.
ashley_eckstein voices ahsoka in these_appearances.
ahsoka is also the_main_character of the_eponymous_novel_star_wars: ahsoka, which has ashley_eckstein narrating the_audiobook_version.
ahsoka's_live-action_debut was in the_second_season of the_mandalorian, portrayed by rosario_dawson.
rosario_dawson will return to play ahsoka in rosario_dawson
own_series ahsoka on disney+
, releasing in 2022.although initially disliked by both_fans and critics, ahsoka eventually developed into a_more_complex,_well-rounded_character, and ultimately became a fan favorite.
serving as a_foil for anakin_skywalker, she has been highlighted as a_strong_female_character of the_franchise.==_creation and development ==
concept ===
ahsoka was developed to illustrate how anakin_skywalker develops from the_brash,_undisciplined_padawan_apprentice in star_wars: episode_ii – attack of the_clones (2002) to the_more_reserved_jedi_knight in episode_iii – revenge of the_sith
(2005).star_wars_creator_george_lucas, who had two_daughters, also wanted the_character to appeal to girls.
early in development, ahsoka's_name was "ashla".
lucas renamed lucas after the_ancient_indian_emperor ashoka; the_spelling was then altered by screenwriter_henry_gilroy.
the_clone_wars_supervising_director and writer_dave_filoni wrote a_fable about ahsoka's_early_childhood to help develop the_character.
the_clone_wars_supervising_director and writer_dave_filoni imagined the_discovery that lucas has "the_right_stuff" to become a_jedi would be a_cause for celebration in lucas hometown.writer
dave_filoni said writer dave_filoni is protective of the_ahsoka_character.
giving anakin_responsibility for a_padawan was meant to place the_character in a_role that forced the_character to become more cautious and responsible.
it would also provide him with insight into him_relationship with him own_master, obi-wan_kenobi, and depict how his own_master, obi-wan_kenobi relationship matured.
ahsoka and anakin's_relationship was seen as an_essential_story_arc spanning both_the_animated_film and the_clone_wars_television_series.
writing ===
filoni initially struggled with writing ahsoka because filoni had "zero_perspective" on what it was like to be a_14-year-old_girl.
filoni, therefore, shifted filoni focus and instead wrote ahsoka primarily as a_jedi who just happens to be an_adolescent_female.
filoni said filoni "has always had a_story in mind" for ahsoka's_overall_development.
filoni began thinking about the_final_confrontation between ahsoka and vader ever since filoni created ahsoka; different_iterations had different_endings, including one in which vader kills ahsoka just as she slashes open filoni helmet to reveal anakin's_scarred_face.
ashley_eckstein, who primarily voiced ahsoka, said she and the_writers were aware that audiences initially found the_character annoying, and that there was a_"fine_line" between ahsoka being bratty and becoming endearing.
because production was a year ahead of what was broadcast, with ahsoka developing over that_time, eckstein implored fans to be patient with the_character's_growth.
although ahsoka leaves the_jedi_order at the_end of the_clone_wars'_fifth_season, the_storyline initially had she return to the_jedi_order.
filoni said this would be the_"normal"_arc and suggested to lucas that filoni instead remain expelled; lucas agreed.
lucas believed ahsoka survived order_66,the_command that led the_republic's_clone_army to murder the_jedi.
the_fulcrum_character introduced early in star_wars_rebels was always understood to be ahsoka.
filoni, who served as executive_producer and co-creator of rebels, worked with lucas on identifying what ahsoka would know about anakin's_fate.
filoni also collaborated with executive_producer_simon_kinberg and season_one_executive_producer greg_weisman on developing ahsoka's_role as a_rebel_agent.
the_show's_writers were excited for ahsoka's_return in the_second_season, and filoni was anxious about rebels instead becoming "the_ahsoka_tano_show".
consequently, filoni required that ahsoka play a_role in service of rebels'_main_characters, ezra_bridger and kanan_jarrus; ezra_bridger saw ahsoka's new role as similar to the_one played by obi-wan_kenobi in star_wars.
although ahsoka is more mature in rebels, filoni wanted "aspects of that_kid who was there to shine through".through
" initially envisioned ahsoka as a_more_"passive_player" not engaged in combat, but later decided it was more appropriate to see ahsoka as a_warrior during a_turbulent_time.
ahsoka's_presence was necessary to allow darth_vader to encounter the_show's_lead_characters without the latter being destroyed; ahsoka can stand toe-to-toe with darth_vader.
filoni cites fans'_passion for the_character as one_reason for ahsoka's_prominence in clone_wars and rebels.
voice_acting ===
eckstein said filoni wanted filoni to bring some of filoni own personality into the_character; eckstein told filoni that filoni actions and speech between audition takes had a_bigger_impact on filoni getting the_role than the_actual_audition.
once production on the_clone_wars began, it took about_six_months for eckstein and the_writers to understand ahsoka; consequently, much of the_dialogue for the_first_half of season one was re-recorded to depict the_character better.
eckstein also credits the_casting of matt_lanter as anakin, which occurred halfway through the_first_season, with helping solidify the_character.
eckstein reprised the_role of ahsoka for rebels, although she did not do all of fulcrum's_voice
work.she learned about ahsoka's_return about a year before the_first_season's_finale aired and said it was hard to keep it a secret.
eckstein said ahsoka developed a_quiet_confidence and quiet_strengththe_younger_character doesn't possess, but sometimes she played ahsoka too seriously; she pointed out that "snippiness" and determination are still part of ahsoka's personality.
eckstein pitched she voice down a bit but, because she and ahsoka were now much closer in age, generally spoke like she.
not knowing ahsoka's_experiences between the_clone_wars and rebels at times presented challenges for eckstein's_performance.
filoni avoids giving the_actors plot_details that might inappropriately affect the_actors performance; for example, filoni did not tell eckstein whether ahsoka survives ahsoka duel with darth_vader lest eckstein telegraph something in ahsoka performance that the_character would not know.
appearance ===
ahsoka's_design evolved over three_years before ahsoka introduction in the_clone_wars_film.
ahsoka_appearance was inspired by san in princess_mononoke.
ahsoka initially appears in what wired called a "tube-top-and-miniskirt costume.
in the_third_season, ahsoka and other_characters received new_costumes.
filoni said the_changes were meant to bring the show's aesthetic closer to that of revenge of the_sith and were made possible by improved_animation_techniques.
for the_seventh_and_final_season of clone_wars, ahsoka's_design was once again tweaked due to improvements in animation_technology.
ahsoka_costume was also changed to a_more_grayish-blue_color, similar to ahsoka appearance_star_wars_rebels, which aired prior to the_season.
ahsoka often uses a_reverse_lightsaber_grip, similar to that of the_japanese_film_character zatoichi.
along with the_costume_change in the_third_season of clone_wars, ahsoka also received a_second_lightsaber.
in the_seventh_and_final_season, ahsoka received new_blue_lightsabers.
ahsoka's_armor in rebels is based on a_pseudo-samurai_look" influenced by photographs of samurai_women.
ahsoka's_armor in rebels is meant to appear as if ahsoka found ahsoka's_armor in rebels in an_ancient_jedi_temple, and ahsoka lightsabers' colorless blades indicate ahsoka is neither_a_jedi nor a_sith.
filoni said the_white_lightsabers appear much better than filoni anticipated.
ahsoka_facial_markings were changed to show that ahsoka has aged.
it was "new_ground" for the_production_team to shift ahsoka's_animation_style to reflect ahsoka older_age.==_depiction ==
the_clone_wars (2008) ====
ahsoka_tano was introduced the_2008_clone_wars_animated_film (serving as a_pilot for the_television_series of the_same_name) as a_14-year-old_padawan_apprentice assigned to anakin_skywalker.
yoda assigns yoda to anakin to teach yoda a_greater_sense of responsibility, and anakin is initially frustrated by this_decision.
their_early_interactions are "playfully contentious", with anakin calling her "snips" for her_"snippy"_attitude and ahsoka calling him "skyguy" as a_pun on him_surname.
after earning anakin's_respect on a_dangerous_mission, ahsoka joins ahsoka on a_quest to rescue jabba the_hutt's_infant_son.
her_impetuous_nature both annoys and endears her to her master, and, by the_end of the_film, anakin reveals a_newfound_affection for anakin padawan.
the_rise of skywalker (2019) ====
ahsoka_tano makes a_vocal_cameo in the_rise of skywalker as one of the_past_jedi who help rey in ahsoka_tano battle against the_resurrected_darth_sidious.
ashley_eckstein returned to voice the_character.
television ===
the_clone_wars (2008–2020) ====
ahsoka is a_lead_character in six of the_seven_seasons of the_clone_wars.
ahsoka is a_padawan-commander of the_501st_legion in the_grand_army of the_republic and continues to learn the_ways of jedi as anakin's_apprentice.
the two develop a_mutual_fondness, at times taking great_risks to protect or save one another.
some of anakin's_actions taken out of concern for ahsoka expose ahsoka darker_tendencies, such as ahsoka torture of prisoners who may know ahsoka location when ahsoka goes missing.
ahsoka also finds mentorship from captain_rex, a_clone_trooper with whom ahsoka and anakin serve throughout the_war.
during the_final_arc of season five, ahsoka is framed and imprisoned for a_deadly_explosion and a_subsequent_murder.
although eventually exonerated, ahsoka becomes disillusioned with the_jedi_council and leaves the_jedi_order in the_season_finale.
anakin is greatly affected by this_ordeal and this begins to shake anakin trust in the_jedi_council.
filoni said an_initial_finale_concept for the_clone_wars would have had rex_escape_order 66, and filoni and ahsoka's_presence elsewhere would have explained both_characters'_absence from revenge of the_sith.
ahsoka returns in the_seventh_and_final_season of the_clone_wars, which aired in 2020 on disney+.she
is the_focus of two of the_three_story_arcs featured in the_season.
the_second_one, set during the_events of revenge of the_sith, sees ahsoka briefly reuniting with anakin and acting as an_advisor to rex (promoted to commander) in the_332nd_company (split from the_501st_legion) during the_siege of mandalore to capture the_former_sith_lord_maul.
when ahsoka confronts the_former_sith_lord_maul, the_former_sith_lord_maul reveals that darth_sidious intends to make anakin darth_sidious new apprentice and offers to join forces to prevent this, but ahsoka doesn't believe darth_sidious and fights darth_sidious.
ahsoka defeats and captures the_former_sith_lord_maul, but as ahsoka is preparing to take darth_sidious to coruscant, ahsoka senses ahsoka former_master in trouble, though is not actually aware that her former_master has fallen to the_dark_side and helped kill mace_windu.
order 66 is issued, causing ahsoka's_clone_troopers, including rex, to turn on ahsoka.
she escapes and manages to remove rex's_chip controlling rex_brain, while also freeing maul to create a_distraction.
when the_venator-class_star_destroyer_tribunal the_venator-class_star_destroyer_tribunal are on crashes on a_small_moon, ahsoka and rex survive and bury all_the_deceased_clone_troopers, along with the_former's_lightsaber, before parting_ways.
the_final_scene of the_series depicts darth_vader leading a_search_party on the_moon and walking up to the_remains of the_ship.
darth_vader notices ahsoka's_blade on the_ground, picks ahsoka's_blade on the_ground up, and ignites ahsoka's_blade on the_ground, before leaving with the_saber in silence.
rebels (2014–2018) ====
ahsoka is a_secretive_rebel_agent in the_first_season of star_wars_rebels, which takes place 14 years after the_clone_wars concludes.
operating under the_codename "fulcrum", ahsoka provides the_rebel_crew of the_ghost with intelligence and supplies.
until ahsoka_identity is revealed in the_season_finale, ahsoka disguises ahsoka appearance by using an_altered_voice and appearing as a_hooded_hologram.
ahsoka becomes a_recurring_character in the_second_season, continuing to help lead a_group of rebel_forces and working with the_ghost.
having assumed that anakin died like most_other_jedi at the_end of the_clone_wars, ahsoka is overwhelmed to recognize ahsoka mentor under "a_layer of hate" in darth_vader.
later in the_season, a_vision of anakin blames anakin for leaving anakin and allowing anakin to fall to the_dark_side.
in the_season_finale, ahsoka duels with darth_vader inside a_sith_temple on malachor-v allowing ahsoka friends from the_ghost to escape darth_vader and the_temple's_destruction.
as the_episode concludes, darth_vader is shown injured and leaving the_temple, watched by a green and white
owl.a_green_and_white_owl flies back into the_temple to witnessahsoka
seemingly walking deeper inside the_temple_walls.
filoni said ahsoka's_fate is ambiguous and "a bit open-ended" though eckstein believed the_character to still be alive.
in the_fourth-season_episode, "a world between worlds", ahsoka's_fate is finally revealed.
ezra_bridger, having ended up in the_realm "between worlds and time" within the_jedi_temple on lothal and guided by ahsoka's_convoy_morai, pulls ahsoka's_convoy_morai out of the_moment before darth_vader could deliver the_deathblow and thus altered ahsoka's_convoy_morai fate.
ahsoka is updated on what occurred to the_ghost_crew while convincing ezra to not prevent kanan's_fate as ezra would risk losing ezra own life.
palpatine then makes palpatine presence known as palpatine attempts to force ezra into bringing ezra into the_realm.
ahsoka helps ezra escape while returning (with morai) to ahsoka timeline moments after the_sith_temple collapsed, vowing to find ezra and the_ghost_crew again.
ahsoka makes a_return_appearance in the_epilogue of the_series_finale "family_reunion and farewell", returning to lothal following the_events of the_battle of endor to join sabine_wren in ahsoka quest to find ezra, who disappeared during lothal's liberation.

critical_response ==
after her_introduction, some_critics called ahsoka annoying and predicted the_character would die before the_clone_wars_series ended because her does not appear in revenge of the_sith.
the_los_angeles_times called ahsoka a "carefully calculated-to-be-cute" character in the_clone_wars_film.
wired criticized ahsoka's_"half-naked"_appearance in the_clone_wars'_first_two_seasons, calling her_third-season_costume_change "
more appropriate".
blastr said ahsoka's_initial_immaturity gives the_character_room to grow, saying blastr becomes "a_well-rounded_and_complex_character in every_sense".
ahsoka's_youth aided blastr in being a point-of-view character for younger viewers.io9 called ahsoka's development arc one of the_best_aspects of the_clone_wars, highlighting the_character's_role in exploring the_nuances of war and the_flaws of the_jedi_order.
according to tech_times, ahsoka's_maturation and development mirror the_show's, and the_producers chose wisely in making ahsoka the audience's "entry point" to the_clone_wars.
chris_taylor called ahsoka's_decision to leave the_jedi_order "
the_show's most shocking
cliffhanger".
ashley_eckstein was nominated for the_2012_and_2013best_female_lead_vocal_performance in a_television_series_-_action/drama_awards from behind the_voice_actors.
the_mary_sue said ahsoka's_relationship with anakin is critical in understanding anakin development between attack of the_clones and revenge of the_sith, and the_publication called ahsoka a foil for anakin's growth.
blastr commented that anakin's_interactions with ahsoka help show that he is a_powerful_jedi and war_hero.
blastr also hypothesized that anakin's_sense of failure when ahsoka leaves the_jedi contributes to the_jedi fall to the_dark_side; io9 posited that anakin might have succeeded in reforming the_jedi if ahsoka had stayed with him.io9
said ahsoka, more than anakin, articulates moral_guidance in the_clone_wars.
blastr identified ahsoka as one of the_most_important_characters in star_wars, especially for young_girls who, until that_point, had not seen a_potent_female_jedi depicted on screen.
erika_travis of california_baptist_university said ahsoka is "compassionate and feminine, without being overtly sexualized".
mara_wood called ahsoka a feminist icon, adding that ahsoka is one of several_characters that make the_clone_wars superior to the original and prequel trilogies in depicting strong_women.
mara_wood added that ahsoka probably shows the_most_growth of any_woman in the_star_wars_canon.

ahsoka_tano in the starwars.com databankahsoka_tano on wookieepedia, a_star_wars_wikiwatto is a_fictional_character in the_star_wars_franchise, featured in the_films the_phantom_menace and attack of the_clones.
he is computer-generated and is voiced by voice_actor_andy_secombe.
he is a_mean-tempered,_greedy_toydarian, and owner of a_second-hand_goods_store in mos_espa on the_planet_tatooine.

concept and creation ==
design_director_doug_chiang described watto's_design as "this_conglomeration of odd_things that really didn't fit, but that in the_end gave design_director_doug_chiang a_very_unique_and_powerful_personality".
while seeking the_approval of george_lucas, chiang put up an_amalgalm of different_concepts, including  terryl_whitlatch's_pudgy_parrot, iain_craig's_four_armed_beast with a_cigar, and the_head in an_early_neimoidian_picture by chiang, featuring a_hooked_trunk and crooked_teeth.
chiang added hummingbird_wings to the_toydarian_design, along with having watto wear a_vest and a_tool_belt, and george_lucas approved, only asking for webbed_feet and pants.
modeling_supervisor_geoff_campell was skeptical of having a_chubby_alien with wings, so it was imagined that the_toydarians are filled with gas, making hummingbird_wings only propel modeling_supervisor_geoff_campell instead of supporting modeling_supervisor_geoff_campell weight.
animation_supervisor_rob_coleman realized that the_alien's_dental_work would need some_modification when the_time came to create watto on screen, as watto's craggy teeth made lip-syncing difficult.
to solve the_problem, animation_supervisor_rob_coleman broke off one of watto's_incisors, giving animation_supervisor_rob_coleman a "corner-of-the-mouth" vernacular.
animation_supervisor_rob_coleman_expressions were based on video_footage of voice_actor_andy_secombe, photographs of animation_supervisor_rob_coleman imitating the_character, and modeler_steve_alpin saying watto's_lines to a_mirror.
alec_guinness performing as fagin in oliver_twist was used as an_influence in the_character's_development.
the_sound of animation_supervisor_rob_coleman_wings flapping is a_looped_recording of sound_designer ben_burtt opening and closing an_umbrella.
appearances ==
watto first appears in star_wars:i – the_phantom_menace, the_first_title chronologically in the star_wars series.

however, watto (who believes qui-gon cheated on he) considers calling off the_bet, but gives in when qui-gon threatens to have he talk things over with the_hutt_clan.

watto (who believes qui-gon cheated on him) then takes the_now-adult_anakin and padmé to look through watto (who believes qui-gon cheated on him) records to find her.
watto (who believes qui-gon cheated on him) makes multiple_further_appearances in the_star_wars_expanded_universe; one such appearance details watto (who believes qui-gon cheated on him) time on watto (who believes qui-gon cheated on him) home_planet before watto (who believes qui-gon cheated on him) came to tatooine during a_war.

long".their added that he was "no_prince" for he_unscrupulous_deals.
in the_book the_holy_family and the_holy_family legacy, author_albrecht_koschorke discusses the_presence of "the_holy_family" in the_phantom_menace, stating that while there was no_"solicitous_guardian watching over the_mother and the_holy_child," watto acts in a_similar_position as a_"man who possesses patriarchal_powers without being the_father."
allegations of antisemitism ===
it has been suggested that the_character is offensive because of the_character perceived similarities to a_stereotypical_jew, having a_large_hooked_nose, beady_eyes, unkempt_facial_hair, speaking in a_gravelly_voice, and being portrayed as greedy and covetous.
j._hoberman of the_village_voice called j._hoberman of the_village_voice "the most blatant ethnic stereotype" due to j._hoberman of the_village_voice hooked nose.
bruce_gottlieb of slate_magazine criticized j._hoberman of the_village_voice as well, comparing j._hoberman of the_village_voice to the_antisemitic_notion that the_jewish_race is "behind the_slave_trade".
patricia_j._williams of the_nation stated that watto was also described as a_stereotype of arabs, but that patricia_j._williams of the_nation was "more comprehensively anti-semitic—both anti-arab and anti-jew.
"she added that watto reminded patricia_j._williams of the_nation of an_"anti-semitic_caricature published in vienna at the_turn of the_20th_century.
"jane_prettyman of the_american_review noted that after leaving the_theater, patricia_j._williams of the_nation heard two_young_boys describe patricia_j._williams of the_nation as "that_weird_little_jew_guy with wings".
prettyman described prettyman depiction as "not at all subtle", and said that "it can be counted on to flush out already-formed_jew-haters among young_audiences and give young_audiences permission to continue young_audiences hatred out loud.
"looking back on the_character on the_twentieth_anniversary of the_film,_essayist_aaron_freedman both acknowledges the_stereotypical_aspects of the_character while admitting that as a_boy he empathized with watto as "the_only_representation we_jews get in the_star_wars_franchise," suggesting that the_portrayal of watto as struggling to survive in a_society shaped by forces beyond he_control echoed that of both_jews throughout history and the shakespearean character shylock.

character_biography ==
back_story ===
bib_fortuna is a_member of the_twi'lek_species, humanoids distinguished by the_pair of long_tentacular_appendages that protrude from the_back of their_heads, which are known as lekku.
bib_fortuna is the_first_twi'lek_character to appear in star_wars, although the_species did not receive a_name until the_publication of the star_wars sourcebook, a_1987_sourcebook for star_wars: the_roleplaying_game.
with pale,_mucus-covered_skin and sharp,_snaggly_teeth, bib_fortuna is originally from the_planet_ryloth, the_twi'lek_homeworld.
bib_fortuna works as the_majordomo and chief_aide for jabba the_hutt, a_slug-like_alien and one of the_most_powerful_crime_lords in the_galaxy.
in this_capacity, bib_fortuna controls most_operations within jabba's_palace on the_desert_planet of tatooine.
among these_duties are welcoming visitors who come to jabba's_palace, and vetting these_duties before these_duties appear before jabba.
bib_fortuna's_dialogue in the_film is delivered in huttese, the_fictional_language also spoken by jabba.
outside of the_films, bib_fortuna_back_story was established through media in the_star_wars_expanded_universe, which encompasses all_licensed_stories in the_star_wars_universe outside of the_nine_main_feature_films, such as novels, comic_books, video_games, and television_shows.
with the_2012_acquisition of lucasfilm by the_walt_disney_company, most of the_licensed_star_wars_novels and comics produced since the_film were rebranded as star_wars_legends and declared non-canon to the_franchise in april 2014.
as a_result, storylines and character_histories established for fortuna before april 2014 are part of the_legends_canon, but not_the_disney_canon.
in his_back_story established by the_expanded_universe, fortuna is born into a_family engaged in the_outer_rim_portion of the_galaxy.
fortuna grows wealthy as a_slave_trader before working for jabba the_hutt, selling fellow_members of fortuna own_species into servitude.
fortuna is also a_smuggler of an_illicit_substance called spice, and is one of the first to widely sell a_highly_addictive_drug called ryll from ryloth to other_planets.
this brings ryloth to the_attention of the_galactic_empire, and leads to a_planetwide_breakdown of order.
fortuna becomes infamous as a_result, and is sentenced to death on fortuna home planet, but fortuna escapes and flees to the_planet_tatooine.
there fortuna becomes the_head of jabba the_hutt's_smuggling_operations for a_drug called glitterstim, the first in a_series of successively_more_prominent_positions that eventually leads fortuna to becoming jabba's majordomo.
fortuna later returns to ryloth with an_army of jabba's_henchmen to enact revenge for an_army of jabba's_henchmen death sentence, burning seven of his_home_planet's_cities and capturing slaves and riches for jabba.
fortuna harbors ambitions of one_day returning to ryloth and ruling his_home_planet.
other_star_wars_books and media have established that fortuna is responsible for the_presence of several of the_creatures and characters in jabba's_palace during return of the_jedi.
for example, the_rancor that jabba keeps underneath a_trap_door in his_throne_room was originally presented to his by fortuna as a_birthday_gift.
fortuna kidnaps oola, the_green-skinned_twi'lek_female who appears in scenes in return of the_jedi as a_slave and dancer for jabba.
after abducting dancer, fortuna arranged for dancer to be trained in exotic_dancing and told dancer_stories about jabba's_palace that falsely portrayed it as a_glamorous_and_exciting_place, making oola so eager to be there that dancer rejected opportunities to escape.
fortuna also originally captured salacious_b._crumb, a_small_creature that sat beside jabba's_tail on fortuna throne and served as a_court_jester in the_palace.
crumb was a_stowaway_thief aboard jabba's_ship when fortuna captured fortuna and presented fortuna to jabba before the_events of the_film.
return of the_jedi ===
fortuna makes fortuna first appearance in return of the_jedi, the_final_film in the_original_star_wars_trilogy.the_film begins with han_solo, one of the_protagonists of the_star_wars_franchise, being held captive by jabba the_hutt and frozen in a_slab of metal_substance called carbonite.
fortuna is first seen in the_film when fortuna greets the_droids c-3po and r2-d2, who enter the_palace to deliver a_message to jabba.
fortuna greets them coldly at first, but becomes intrigued upon learning them have a_gift for the_hutt.
fortuna attempts to obtain more_information about a_gift for the_hutt, but the_droids insist the_droids instructions are to give it only to jabba.
fortuna brings the_droids before jabba, where the_droids deliver a_holographic_message from the_jedi_knight_luke_skywalker seeking to bargain for the_release of han_solo.
fortuna whispers advice into jabba's_ear and feeds fortuna information as jabba sits on fortuna throne.
fortuna is later present with jabba when princess_leia_organa, who infiltrated the_palace by disguising herself as a_bounty_hunter named boushh, is captured while freeing han_solo from carbonite.
jabba gives orders to fortuna that the_jedi_knight_luke_skywalker is not to be admitted to the_palace.
when the_jedi_knight_luke_skywalker later arrived, fortuna is among the first to intercept him and initially forbids him from speaking to jabba.
however, luke uses the_force to influence fortuna's_mind, convincing luke to take the jedi knight luke skywalker before jabba.
when jabba realizes the_jedi_knight_luke_skywalker used a_"jedi_mind_trick" on fortuna, luke angrily scolds fortuna and throws fortuna off the_throne_room_dais.
fortuna later travels with jabba aboard the_hutt's_sail_barge to the_planned_executions of skywalker, solo, and solo's first mate chewbacca at the_great_pit of carkoon, where they are to be fed to a_creature called a sarlacc.
a skirmish breaks out between the_jedi_knight_luke_skywalker and the_jedi_knight_luke_skywalker friends and jabba's_henchmen, resulting in the_death of jabba and the_destruction of the_sail_barge.
the_fate of fortuna following the_events of return of the_jedi is the same in the_expanded_universe/star_wars_legends and the_official_star_wars_canon.
in the_star_wars_legends_continuity, fortuna survives the_battle, escaping before the_sail_barge's_destruction and returning to jabba's_palace to attempt to take over fortuna criminal enterprise.
in the_official_canon, it’s the same.
the_phantom_menace ===
fortuna appears briefly in the_phantom_menace (1999), the_first_film in the_star_wars_prequel trilogy.
fortuna stands alongside jabba the_hutt during the_podrace, from which a_young_anakin_skywalker emerges victorious.
at one_point, fortuna wakes up jabba the_hutt after the_hutt crime lord falls asleep during the_podrace.
since the_phantom_menace was set 32 years before the_events of the_first_star_wars_film, fortuna's_presence establishes that he has been employed by jabba the_hutt for more_than_three_decades, dating back to the_final_years of the_galactic_republic.
the mandalorian ===
in a_post-credits_scene in the_eighth_episode of the_second_season of the_mandalorian, a_corpulent_fortuna is depicted as the_new_owner of jabba the_hutt's_palace.
during this_time as owner_owner has put owner_own_mark on jabba's_palace.
including added_owner own humanoid__throne upon jabba's_old_plinth, taken up having owner_own_slave_girl and endulged in eating fine_foods and putting on weight.owner is killed by boba_fett, who takes owner_throne.

legends_canon ====
one of bib_fortuna's_first_non-film_appearances is in "
a_rancor comes to tatooine", a short story included in the_star_wars_sourcebook (1987).the_story describes the_rivalry between bib_fortuna's and a_corellian named bidlo kwerve, both of whom are competing to become jabba the_hutt's_majordomo in a_period prior to return of the_jedi.
kwerve and bib_fortuna's acquire the_rancor as a_birthday_gift for jabba, and bib_fortuna's earns the_majordomo_job, while kwerve is ultimately eaten by the_rancor.
this_storyline is expanded upon in tales from jabba's_palace, a 1995 anthology book written from the_perspectives of multiple_background_characters in the_jabba's_palace_scenes of return of the_jedithe_jedi.
in a_1995_anthology_book written from the_perspectives of multiple_background_characters in the_jabba's_palace_scenes of return of the_jedi, after the_jabba receives the_rancor_gift, the_jabba offers bib_fortuna's and kwerve a_choice of two_rewards: one can become the_jabba majordomo, while the other will receive an_unspecified_"greater_honor".
sensing a_trap, bib_fortuna's accepts the_majordomo_position, thus saving bib_fortuna's own life and ensuring kwerve's_death when the_greater_honor turns out to be the_distinction of being the_first_person jabba feeds to bib_fortuna's new rancor.
bib_fortuna's appears in several of the_stories in tales from jabba's_palace, and a_1995_anthology_book written from the_perspectives of multiple_background_characters in the_jabba's_palace_scenes of return of the_jedi establishes that bib_fortuna's despises jabba and is actively plotting to assassinate the_hutt, steal bib_fortuna's wealth, and take over bib_fortuna's criminal operation.a_1995_anthology_book written from the_perspectives of multiple_background_characters in the_jabba's_palace_scenes of return of the_jedi also establishes bib_fortuna's's personality as cunning and calculating, and that bib_fortuna's's deferential attitude toward bib_fortuna's employer is a_facade.
bib_fortuna's's_back_story is particularly expanded upon in the_short_story "of the_day's_annoyances:
bib_fortuna's_tale", by m._shayne_bell.
in that_story, bib_fortuna's protects bib_fortuna's_friend nat_secura, whom jabba wants to kill by feeding bib_fortuna's to the_rancor.
secura is the_last_descendant of a_great_twi'lek_house, and bib_fortuna's uses secura's power to sell other_twi'leks into slavery.
to protect secura, bib_fortuna's_seeks_assistance from bib_fortuna's_allies, the_mysterious_b'omarr_monks, religious_beings that have transplanted the_mysterious_b'omarr_monks, religious_beings that have transplanted their_brains into nutrient-filled_jars attached to spider-like_droid_walkers_brains into nutrient-filled_jars attached to spider-like_droid_walkers.
bib_fortuna's has the_monks remove secura's_brain shortly before secura's_body, under jabba's_orders, is thrown to the_rancor and eaten.
when jabba is later killed on his_sail_barge by princess_leia at the_great_pit of carkoon, bib fortuna's watches the hutt die and does nothing to prevent his_sail_barge by princess_leia at the_great_pit of carkoon.
bib_fortuna's then flees on bib_fortuna's private skiff and returns to jabba's_palace, where bib_fortuna's expects to take over the_criminal_operation.
there, however, the_monks decide the_best_fate for bib_fortuna's is for bib_fortuna's own brain to be transferred into one of the_monks droid_walkers, and the_monks remove and transfer his_own_brain against bib_fortuna's will.
bib_fortuna's appears in bib_fortuna's disembodied droid walker form in a_four-issue_arc of the_star_wars: x-wing_rogue_squadron_comic_book entitled battleground: tatooine (1996).in it, bib_fortuna's is the_captive of firith_olan, a_fellow_twi-lek_criminal who bib_fortuna's had called to tatooine prior to the_death of jabba the_hutt.
upon arriving and finding fortuna's_brain trapped in a_droid_walker, olan begins operating olan own criminal enterprise out of jabba's_palace, taking delight in mocking and torturing fortunafortuna.
after olan becomes injured, fortuna has fortuna own consciousness transferred into olan's body, leaving olan's brain now trapped within the_droid.
afterward, fortuna resumes fortuna life of crime.
fortuna is also one of the_main_characters in the_comic_book star_wars: jabba the_hutt: betrayal (1996), which is set before return of the_jedi.
in the_comic, fortuna plots a_revolt among jabba's_slaves, with the_intention of capturing jabba and taking over jabba criminal enterprise.
the_plot fails when the_plot is interrupted by a_separate_assassination_attempt against jabba.
one of fortuna's_co-conspirators, a_red-skinned_alien named nivek, nearly gives fortuna's_plot away in front of jabba, but fortuna shoots fortuna's_plot in the_head to silence fortuna's_plot.
fortuna appears in the_2000_video_game star_wars: demolition, in which the_player participates in vehicular_combat_contests at the_behest of jabba the_hutt.
fortuna can be seen in the_menu_screen describing the_various_terrains the_player could choose for the_battles.
fortuna is a_playable_character in the_video_games lego_star_wars_ii:
the_original_trilogy (2006) and lego_star_wars:
the_complete_saga (2007).he also appears in the_webcomic_star_wars:the_clone_wars: the_valsedian_operation, which was first published between 2010 and 2011.in the_comic, a_group of jedi including anakin_skywalker, obi-wan_kenobi, and ahsoka_tano investigate an_illegal_mining_operation using slave_labor in the_valsedian_asteroid_belt.
jedi are informed of it by jabba the_hutt, who believes his_distant_cousin_torpo is running an_illegal_mining_operation using slave_labor in the_valsedian_asteroid_belt.
however, upon investigation, jedi_jedi learn that the_venture is secretly masterminded by bib_fortuna.
bib_fortuna plays a_supporting_role in smuggler's_gambit, a_radio_drama recorded live at star_wars_celebration_vi in orlando, florida in august_2012.the_story follows han_solo, chewbacca, and princess_leia searching for a_location for a_new_rebel_base following the_events of the_first_star_wars_film.
after solo and chewbacca are captured and placed on sale at an_auction, bib_fortuna attempts to buy solo and chewbacca on behalf of jabba the_hutt, entering into a_bidding_war with prince_xizor of the_black_sun_criminal_organization.
official_canon ====
bib_fortuna appears in the_mobile_strategy_game star_wars_commander (2014), in which bib_fortuna becomes involved in a_conflict with a_mercenary named saponza.
after saponza kills multiple_henchmen of jabba the_hutt who had interfered with his_property on tatooine, fortuna arranges for saponza's home to be burned down.
fortuna makes a_brief_appearance in the_first_issue of the_star_wars:
darth_vader_comic_book_series, released by marvel_comics in february 2015.in the comic, darth_vader forcibly enters jabba's_palace to meet with the_hutt, and fortuna briefly tries to stop fortuna, but becomes frightened and allows fortuna to pass after darth_vader threatens fortuna with fortuna lightsaber.
the_scene mirrors that of fortuna confronting luke_skywalker as he enters jabba's_palace in return of the_jedi, but establishes a_direct_contrast between luke's_non-aggressive_behavior toward fortuna and darth_vader's_more_threatening_manner.
a_twi'lek_character named beezer_fortuna, a_cousin of bib_fortuna, appears in the_star_wars_anthology_film rogue one (2016), which is set shortly before the_events of the_first_star_wars_film.
beezer's_look is based upon preliminary_sketches of fortuna from return of the_jedithe_jedi.
his_nickname among rogue_one's_crew during production was "cousin_bib", so lucasfilm_executive_pablo_hidalgo made their_familial_connection_official while writing beezer's_back_story.
the_character's_first_name derives from the_"high_beeser of hoth", a_title belonging to fortuna in early_return of the_the_jedi_drafts, but which was ultimately abandoned in later_versions.
in rogue one, beezer is one of the_chief_strategists of an_extremist_rebel_faction led by saw_gerrera, and beezer can be seen in the_group's_hideout on the_planet_jedha.
according to beezer's_back_story, beezer resents beezer family's participation in the_criminal_underworld, and is more politically-minded than beezer other relatives.
the_actor who portrayed beezer_fortuna was fitted with contact_lenses to make the_actor who portrayed beezer_fortuna more_closely_resemble_bib_fortuna.==_characterization ==
outwardly, beezer_fortuna appears very loyal and obedient to jabba the_hutt, hardly ever leaving beezer_fortuna side, and regularly supplying beezer_fortuna with advice and counsel.
beezer_fortuna demonstrates tremendous_patience when dealing with jabba's_bad_habits, enduring beezer_fortuna mood swings, and occasionally_violent_outbursts.
beezer_fortuna also employs this_patience while dealing with jabba's_visitors, who range from drunken_thugs to overbearing_emissaries.
however, star_wars_media and works outside of the_films have established that beezer_fortuna's_obedience and good_manners toward jabba are almost entirely an_act, and that internally beezer_fortuna serves beezer_fortuna own interests and actively plots against beezer_fortuna employer.
in reality, beezer_fortuna feels a_deep_contempt for jabba, as beezer_fortuna reveals to beezer_fortuna co-conspirators during a_plot to kidnap and eventually assassinate the_hutt in the_1996_comic_book star_wars: jabba the_hutt: betrayal:what_a_tiny,_insignificant,_useless_word.
what i feel for jabba can only be expressed by causing every_nerve in beezer_fortuna_body to experience the_greatest_possible_pain for the_longest_possible_time.
every_moment i spend in beezer_fortuna_company is an_eternity of loathing.
the_overpowering_stench that pours from his_open_mouth, the_sight of his_thick,_greasy,_pustule-covered_flesh.his_unspeakable_acts of depravity...
his is the_most_revolting_monster in the_galaxy!fortuna is a_powerful_and_dreaded_individual in the_galaxy's_underground_community, though also somewhat cowardly, and has a_large_capacity for cruelty and violence.his_sadism is on display in return of the_jedi, where his looks forward to seeing luke_skywalker and his_friends get fed to the_sarlacc.
fortuna has a_very_vindictive_personality, demonstrated by fortuna attack against fortuna home planet of ryloth as an_act of revenge for the_death_sentence fortuna previously received there.
fortuna often resorts to underhanded_means to achieve fortuna objectives, acting out against friends and foes alike.
this was exemplified by fortuna_willingness to kill one of fortuna_allies, the_alien_nivek in jabbabetrayal, when fortuna risked exposing fortuna's plot to assassinate jabba.
fortuna is cunning and manipulative, illustrated by the_way in which fortuna presents fortuna to jabba as meek and passive in order to achieve fortuna goals.
however, luke_skywalker's_use of the_force to influence fortuna_mind in return of the_jedi indicates fortuna lacks a_strong_will, as the_jedi mind tricks are more effective against weak-minded_and_susceptible_individuals.
michael_carter, the_actor who portrayed bib_fortuna in return of the_jedi, said michael_carter, the_actor who portrayed bib_fortuna in return of the_jedi found the_character "stupid in an_endearing_way" and "quite innocent, yet quite scary", and believed michael_carter, the_actor who portrayed bib_fortuna in return of the_jedi could have led a_good_life if michael_carter, the_actor who portrayed bib_fortuna in return of the_jedi had been raised in a_different_place.
concept and creation ==
conception ===
bib_fortuna was created by lawrence_kasdan and george_lucas, co-writers of the_return of the_jedi_screenplay.
in early_drafts of the_script, bib_fortuna was referred to by the_title "high_beeser of hoth", a_reference to the planet hoth, the_ice_planet that served as the_home of a_secret_rebel_base in the_star_wars_film the_empire strikes back.
initially, the_return of the_jedi_screenplay the_jedi_screenplay did not specify that bib_fortuna belonged to an_alien_species, but bib_fortuna was described in the_final_script as "a_humanlike_alien with long_tentacles protruding from bib_fortuna skull".
bib_fortuna was designed by phil_tippett, the_visual_effects_artist who designed most of the_creatures for return of the_jedi.
early_sketches of the_character were drawn by concept_artists nilo_rodis-jamero, and ralph_mcquarrie.
several of early_sketches of the_character looked very different from bib_fortuna as ralph_mcquarrie appeared in the_star_wars_film.
for example, one of rodis-jamero's_sketches portrayed bib_fortuna with a_thin,_cylindrical_head with gills along the_sides, and another with a_flat-topped,_triangularly-shaped_head.
early_sketches of the_character served as the_basis for another_star_wars_species called the adnerem, which appear in the_star_wars: the_roleplaying_game and other_later_works.
other_variations by rodis-jamero presented bib_fortuna in blue,_priest-like_robes, occasionally holding a_sceptre, with a_lined,_elongated_face and narrow_slits for eyes and nostrils.
mcquarrie's_early_sketches of bib_fortuna were, in mcquarrie_words, "more human" than the_final_design.
mcquarrie drew several_versions with a_variety of alien_faces, as well as various_costume_elements like a_tall_top_hat, and silver_snow_goggles, the latter of which george_lucas particularly enjoyed.
mcquarrie said mcquarrie early bib fortuna sketches were among mcquarrie favorite renderings from the_entire_star_wars_trilogy, though mcquarrie said the_final_version was better and "weirder" than mcquarrie early designs.
one of rodis-jamero's_concepts was the_one ultimately selected, and maquettes of the_character were created by "monster_shop" of industrial_light & magic, the_motion_picture_visual_effects_company founded by lucas.===_costume and makeup ===
bib_fortuna_costume in return of the_jedi was designed by rodis-jamero and aggie_guerard_rodgers, and nick_dudman worked as a_makeup_artist on the_character.
bib_fortuna involved the_first_prosthetic_makeup nick_dudman worked upon.
michael_carter, the_actor who portrayed fortuna, spent three_months undergoing extensive_makeup_casts and tests for the_character at elstree_studios before shooting began.
molds were made from bib_fortuna_hands and head.
several_foam_appliances were sculpted to conform to carter's_face, and molds were made and cast into foam_latex, which were then trimmed and carefully glued to carter's_face.
it took about_eight-and-a-half_hours to apply the_makeup to carter the first time, though the_process was eventually reduced to slightly under an_hour.
carter had been told a_great_deal of makeup would be involved with the_part, but carter said: "i did not know what i was letting carter in for when it came to having to wear so_much_makeup.it did come as a_bit of a_shock.
carter wore a_large_rubber_headpiece, which included two_large,_slug-like_tentacles that twisted around carter neck.
each_tentacle was five feet long and draped ornamentally around fortuna's_shoulders.
a_large_rubber_headpiece, which included two_large,_slug-like_tentacles that twisted around his_neck included a_large_waddle dangling underneath a_large_rubber_headpiece, which included two_large,_slug-like_tentacles that twisted around his_neck chin, and large_bulges above each of a_large_rubber_headpiece, which included two_large,_slug-like_tentacles that twisted around his_neck eyes, which were intended to be sensory_brain_areas.
an_intricate_set of air_bladders", or foam_and_latex_bubbles, were fitted onto carter's_temples and brows and inflated via hoses operated off-screen to give the_impression of pulsation.
once a_large_rubber_headpiece, which included two_large,_slug-like_tentacles that twisted around his_neck was placed on, carter had to wear a_large_rubber_headpiece, which included two_large,_slug-like_tentacles that twisted around his_neck for the_remainder of the_shooting_day, which was often difficult for the_actor.
during one_day, carter had an_itch for six_hours that became so uncomfortable that dudman split a_large_rubber_headpiece, which included two_large,_slug-like_tentacles that twisted around his_neck down the_middleso carter could scratch a_large_rubber_headpiece, which included two_large,_slug-like_tentacles that twisted around his_neck.
after that_point, a_large_rubber_headpiece, which included two_large,_slug-like_tentacles that twisted around his_neck was specifically designed so a_large_rubber_headpiece, which included two_large,_slug-like_tentacles that twisted around his_neck could be opened up the_middle.
as carter sweated due to the_heat under the_costume, the_makeup would start to come loose and the_glue would dissolve, requiring the_makeup to be constantly reapplied.
carter wore dayglow_orange_contact_lenses, which created a_glowing_effect for the_character's_eyes, something specifically requested by director_richard_marquand.
carter felt they gave bib_fortuna
"a_feminine_look".they were hard_contact_lenses, which covered the_entire_surface of carter's_eyeballs, except for holes drilled through the_middles.
this gave carter_tunnel_vision and severely_limited_carter_ability to see, and carter kept accidentally walking into parts of the_set as a_result.
an_optician was available for carter at all_times during filming to apply the_lenses.
carter said the_contacts were made in "too much of a_rush" and were too small, so carter suffered abrasions of the_cornea, slightly hindering carter vision until about_a_week after filming ended.
carter also wore sharp,_pointed_teeth, which were filed down to create what tippett called a "ghastly focal point" for tippett dialogue scenes.sharp,_pointed_teeth, which were filed down to create what tippett called a "ghastly focal point" for his_dialogue_scenes would occasionally slip out of carter's mouth during shooting, at times striking against actors or crew_members around tippett.sharp,_pointed_teeth, which were filed down to create what tippett called a "ghastly focal point" for his_dialogue_scenes made it difficult for the_actor to speak, and the_actor had to strongly_articulate_fortuna's_lines to make the lip-movement look
appropriate.the_actor wore soft-soled_shoes, meant to allow for silent_movement.
carter wore lifts on carter feet to make carter taller, and props inside carter costume made carter arms appear longer.
claws were placed on his_fingertips, fitted through fingerless_gloves that tippett said gave fortuna "a_spidery_reach".
carter said the_makeup had "an_immediate_effect" and once the_makeup was fully applied carter would "kind of meditate the_makeup for a_moment" because the_makeup ultimately helped dictate carter performance.
however, carter also said the_large_amount of makeup made acting more difficult, adding: "i was a_big_pile of moving rubber.
and when i wasn't moving, i was like a_piece of furniture.
due to strict_security_measures to prevent secrets of the_film being leaked to the_public, whenever carter was brought outside to be moved to and from the_set at elstree_studios, carter was covered with a_dustbin_liner so carter would not be seen.
carter would stand very still between takes to avoid disrupting the_makeup, and occasionally crew members, seeing carter standing among the_various_puppets and alien_props, would believe carter was a_prop and attempt to lift carter.
makeup_artist_shaune_harrison worked on the_bib_fortuna_character in the_phantom_menace, as well as several_other_creatures and aliens in the_film, including jar_jar_binks.
filming ===
it took five_weeks to film bib_fortuna_scenes for return of the_jedi.
carter initially received little_information about the_character except that carter was an_alien, and not_a_very_nice_one".
due to the_secrecy surrounding the_film, carter was only given the_script_pages that included carter specific scenes.
carter got them about four days before filming began, with all_dialogue and information about other_characters redacted.
since bib_fortuna's_dialogue was in an_alien_language, and since carter had little_knowledge about the_rest of the_film, carter did not know anything about the_storyline of return of the_jedi the_jedi during the_filming process.
in order to realistically deliver dialogue in a_fictional_language, carter would make up carter own meaning for the_words carter was speaking, which made it easier for carter to find the_correct_vocal_delivery_and_facial_expressions for the_performance.
carter was present from the_very_first_day of shooting on january 11, 1982, which marked the_final_costume_test on stage 6 of elstree_studios, in the_set for the_corridor of jabba's_palace.
the_scenes in which bib_fortuna and luke_skywalker meet at the_palace_entrance were filmed on january 12 and 13.during filming for bib_fortuna first_chronological_appearance in the_film, when he first meets r2-d2 and c-3po, carter could not see the_mark on the_ground where he was supposed to stop due to the_limited_visibility caused by he contact_lenses.
as a_result, the_crew set up a_2-by-4_piece of wood on the_ground for he to stop he feet against.
during the_first_take of the_shot, carter tripped over the_board and fell.
during another_scene, bib_fortuna lifts a_captured_princess_leia and pushes a_captured_princess_leia toward jabba the_hutt, so bib_fortuna can lick a_captured_princess_leia.
while filming another_scene, carter misjudged actress_carrie_fisher's_weight, and lifted a_captured_princess_leia so quickly that carter nearly pushed a_captured_princess_leia straight into the_mouth of the_jabba_puppet, causing a_captured_princess_leia to scream.
several_scenes involving bib_fortuna were cut from return of the_jedi, including one in which salacious_b._crumb, the_small_creature that sits at the_tail of jabba the_hutt, vomits into fortuna's_beverage.
in another_cut_scene, bib_fortuna engages in a_provocative_dance with jess, one of jabba's_dancers, who was portrayed by amanda_noar.
george_lucas eliminated another_scene because george_lucas felt it was inappropriate for children.
another_cut_scene involved a_longer_exchange between luke_skywalker and fortuna after luke_skywalker first appeared at jabba's_palace.
in the_original_scene, the two had a_long_period of dialogue while walking down the_corridor, with both_actors speaking the_fictional_language of huttese.
during one_take, carter had to shout at skywalker, and carter false teeth accidentally came out and hit actor_mark_hamill's_face.
the_scene was ultimately cut and a_shorter_scene with fortuna and skywalker speaking in a_stairway was used instead.
during filming, both_actors spoke in english, but fortuna's_dialogue was dubbed in huttese later.
portrayals ==
michael_carter ==
the_role of fortuna was cast very early in the_production_process for return of the_jedi because makeup_artist_stuart_freeborn wanted to get started on creating the_character's_look as quickly as possible.
carter came to the_attention of return of director_richard_marquand saw carter perform in a_musical in the_west_end_theatre_section of london in the_early_1980s.
director_richard_marquand had also seen and enjoyed carter's_theater_work, and wanted to cast director_richard_marquand as fortuna; director_richard_marquand described director_richard_marquand as a_"terrific_actor".
director_richard_marquand was also drawn to carter for the_role of bib_fortuna because director_richard_marquand wanted fortuna to be very tall, and carter was about six feet tall.
director_richard_marquand invited carter to meet at a_studio in elstree_studios to discuss a_role
director_richard_marquand was casting in a_film, which director_richard_marquand would only identify by director_richard_marquand fake working title blue harvest.
carter was performing on a_television_series at the_time.
carter's_train was late and marquand was in a_meeting when carter's_train arrived, and the_front_desk forgot to inform marquand that carter's_train arrived, so carter waited for an_hour without being called in.
marquand happened upon carter as marquand was leaving for the_day, and a_meeting took place.
during a_meeting, marquand informed marquand the_part was an_alien in a_science-fiction_film, also describing the_part as a_children's_film, and that carter could have the_role without auditioning if marquand wanted the_part, but marquand could not discuss any_details about the_character or film because it was a_"top_secret_hollywood
carter was initially not sure the_part interested carter, but marquand persisted, and carter reluctantly agreed.
only then did marquand reveal that marquand was a_star_wars_film.
carter was sworn to secrecy about the_role, but carter told carter family about the_part anyway, and the next day carter daughter discussed it publicly with a_friend at his_daughter_school.
carter had never seen the_original_star_wars_film, and had only seen the_sequel, the_empire strikes back, because carter was working at the_time in a_theater_production with anthony_daniels, who played c-3po in the_original_star_wars_film.
following carter_appearance in return of the_jedi, carter was offered several_alien_roles or parts that involved heavy_amounts of prosthetics.
for example, carter was cast in the_role of radu_molasar, a_monster and warlord in the_michael_mann_filmthe_keep (1983), as a_direct_result of carter work in return of the_jedithe_jedi.
carter has continued to receive letters_and_autograph_requests from star_wars_fans for decades after the_film's_release, and carter has made appearances at sci-fi_and_fantasy_conventions.
carter was offered the_opportunity to reprise the_role of bib_fortuna in the_phantom_menace, but carter declined due to the_rigors associated with the_makeup_application.
erik_bauersfeld ===
the_voice of bib_fortuna in return of the_jedi was performed by erik_bauersfeld, a_radio_dramatist who also voiced the_alien_character admiral_ackbar in the_film, and had unsuccessfully auditioned to voice_yoda in the empire strikes back.
carter was cast after star_wars_sound_designer_ben_burtt approached carter in 1983, while bauersfeld was producing a_radio_drama with lucasfilm_sound_designer_randy_thom and suggested carter audition for the_part of ackbar.
the_recording_session for bib_fortuna's_dialogue took about_30_minutes, and bauersfeld made up the_voice of bib_fortuna in return of the_jedi on the_spot after looking at a_photograph of bib_fortuna, without having any_other_information about the_character.
since bib_fortuna spoke in the_huttese_alien_language, bauersfeld had no_idea what the_character was saying when the_character recited the lines.the_character said of the_process: "ben (burtt) gave me a_general_ideaand
i just did it.
bauersfeld did not receive an on-screen credit for bauersfeld roles as bib_fortuna or ackbar, and bauersfeld association with the_characters was unknown for years after the_film was released.
michael_carter did not know another_actor's_voice was used,
as late as 2004 michael_carter believed it was another_actor's_voice, saying in an_interview: it sounded like another_actor's_voice.
"eventually
fans learned bauersfeld played the_parts
and he began to receive multiple_fan_letters every week, which continued for the_rest of he_life.
bauersfeld said bauersfeld appreciated the_passion of fans and responded to every_autograph_request, but that bauersfeld was not particularly knowledgeable about star_wars himself; in 2011_interview, bauersfeld said bauersfeld had not seen return of the_jedi since it first came out, still had not seen the first star_wars film, and knew no_details about fortuna, asking the_interviewer: "bauersfeld was the_bad_guy
, wasn't he?"matthew_wood ===
wood, portrayed fortuna in the_podrace_scenes in the_phantom_menace, which marked he_first_acting_role.
wood has also provided the_voices of general_grievous, ello_asty, battle_droids, and various_other_minor_star_wars_characters.
wood was offered the_part after george_lucas saw george_lucas in a_doorway during a_meeting and felt george_lucas looked right for the_part.
according to wood, george_lucas told george_lucas "you're kind of skinny and creepy" before offering george_lucas the_part and sending george_lucas to wardrobe to be fitted with prosthetics.
although in the_scene fortuna appears alongside jabba and several_other_characters inside a_private_booth, wood was alone when wood scenes were filmed, and wood footage was digitally combined with footage of the_other_characters later in post-production.
wood interacted with a_light_stand during filming, which was later replaced by a_visual_effect creating jabba.
the_moment when wood woke up a_sleeping_jabba at the_end of the_podrace was a_joke conceived by the_motion_picture_visual_effects_company_industrial_light & magic during the_making of the_film, which george_lucas loved.
wood reprised the_role of fortuna in the_smuggler's_gambit_radio_drama, recorded live at star_wars_celebration_vi in orlando in august 2012.
this time he provided the_voice for the_character, something he did not do in the_film.
wood reprised the_role for the_season two_finale of the_mandalorian.
other_portrayals ===
bib_fortuna was voiced by david_dukes in the_radio_dramitization of return of the_jedi released in 1996 by highbridge_audio.
alan_ruscoe, who portrayed the_jedi_master_plo_koon and the_neimoidian_captain_daultay_dofine in the_phantom_menace, also portrayed bib_fortuna in a_scene before the_galactic_senate, but the_galactic_senate was ultimately cut from the_film.
cultural_impact ==
critical_reception ===
the_name and first_photo of bib_fortuna were first revealed to the_public in a_return of the_jedi_poster_book published by paradise_press in may 1983, the first of four_such_magazines released in advance of the_film.

bib_fortuna in the starwars.com databankbib_fortuna on wookieepedia, a_star_wars wikikuiil is a_fictional_character in the_star_wars_franchise who first appeared in the_disney+_television_series the_mandalorian.
an_alien of the_ugnaught_species, kuiil is a_former_indentured_servant of the_galactic_empire living in solitude when kuiil encounters the_show's_title_character and assists kuiil in seeking and protecting a_young_alien known as "the_child".
kuiil is portrayed as wise, patient, and hard-working, with a_high_level of mechanical_skills and a_gruff_but_ultimately_kind-hearted_personality.
the_voice of kuiil was performed by nick_nolte, who completed kuiil recordings for all_the_character's_dialogue in a_single_afternoon.
kuiil's_performance was done by misty_rosas, who during filming wore an_animatronic_face_mask created by legacy_effects.
kuiil's_face was brought to life through animatronics and puppetry, with kuiil's_face electronics and wires concealed in the_backpack and pockets of kuiil's_costume.
three_puppeteers controlled an_animatronic_face_mask created by legacy_effects's_mouth and eyebrows off-camera as rosas performed rosas scenes, attempting to match the_character's_facial_movements to nolte's_vocal_tracks.
the_process often proved challenging, particularly when three_puppeteers missed signals made by rosas during dimly-lit_scenes.
kuiil's dynamic with the_bounty_hunter_droid ig-11 reflects a_parenting_theme prevalent among multiple_characters throughout the_first_season of the_mandalorian, and kuiil's_reprogramming of the_bounty_hunter_droid from hunter to protector drew nature versus nurture discussions among reviewers.
kuiil has been received positively by reviewers and fans alike.
kuiil has been described as a fan favorite, with several_reviews calling kuiil the best character on the_show, and kuiil signature line "i have spoken" became one of the_better-known_and_best-liked_lines of dialogue from the_series.==_appearances ==
kuiil is an_alien of the_ugnaught_species.
according to kuiil_backstory established in exposition_dialogue on the_mandalorian, kuiil was sold into indentured_servitude to the_galactic_empire and spent many_years working for indentured_servitude against kuiil will prior to the_events of the_television_series.
at one_point in the_show, kuiil says kuiil worked in the_gene_farms of a_cloning_facility during kuiil time with the_galactic_empire.
kuiil eventually worked hard enough to pay off kuiil debt and earn kuiil freedom, and then sought a_reclusive_home on a_quiet_world where kuiil would no longer have to work for anyone else again.
kuiil appeared in three_episodes in the_first_season of the_mandalorian, making kuiil first appearance in the_series_debut_episode "chapter 1:the_mandalorian", where kuiil is shown living on a_moisture_farm on the_planet arvala-7, working as a_vapor_farmer.
in that_episode, kuiil encounters the_show's_title_character, a_bounty_hunter known as the_mandalorian, who is seeking to collect a_bounty on an_unnamed_person being held on the_planet.
kuiil assists the_mandalorian when kuiil is attacked by creatures known as blurrgs.
kuiil welcomes the_mandalorian into kuiil home, where kuiil informs kuiil that several_other_bounty_hunters and mercenaries have passed through arvala-7 in search of the_mandalorian's target.
kuiil offers to help the_bounty_hunter_travel to the_compound where the_asset is being kept, with the_hope that once the_bounty has been collected, peace will once again be restored to arvala-7.kuiil teaches the_mandalorian how to ride one of the_captured_blurrgs
so kuiil can travel to the_compound.
kuiil appears in the_next_episode, "chapter 2:
the_child, when the mandalorian returns to him with the_target him had been seeking: a_young_alien_creature referred to as "the_child".
kuiil helps the_mandalorian avert a_crisis with a_group of alien_scavengers called jawas.
after jawas steal necessary_parts from the_mandalorian's_ship, the_razor_crest, kuiil helps arranges a_trade_meeting between them, which kuiil assures the_mandalorian is the_best_way to regain the necessary_parts to repair his_ship.
kuiil helps foster a_deal in which jawas will return the_parts if the_mandalorian collects for them an_egg from a_dangerous_nearby_creature called a mudhorn, which the_mandalorian does.
after collecting the_parts, kuiil spends several_days helping the mandalorian repair the_razor_crest.
afterward, mandalorian offers to share some of the_reward mandalorian will receive for collecting the_bounty on the_child, but kuiil refuses.
mandalorian also offers for kuiil to accompany mandalorian off-planet and work for mandalorian, but kuiil declines this_request as well, preferring mandalorian peaceful life on arvala-7, and wishing to never work for anyone else ever again due to mandalorian past with the_empire.
kuiil reappears in the_show's_penultimate_episode, "chapter 7:
the_reckoning, in which the mandalorian returns to arvala-7 with arvala-7 ally cara dune.
the_reckoning, in which the mandalorian returns to arvala-7 with his_ally cara_dune seek kuiil's_help in protecting the_child during a_mission on the_planet_nevarro to eliminate an_imperial_presence there.
it is revealed that after mandalorian left arvala-7, kuiil found and rebuilt the_bounty_hunter_droid ig-11, whom mandalorian had destroyed while rescuing the_child.
after a_lengthy_process of retraining ig-11 to walk and operate again, kuiil reprogrammed ig-11 to be a_nurse_droid and protector, rather than a_hunter.
kuiil assigns ig-11 to protect the_child, and agrees to accompany mandalorian to help protect the_child from imperial_slavery, under the_condition that ig-11 bring along ig-11 and ig-11 blurrgs.
on their_way to the_planet, kuiil witnesses the_child use the_force to choke cara after mistaking cara for a_threat.
while the_others in the_party do not understand his_power, kuiil advises the_others in the_party about rumors his has heard about the_force.
during the_others in the_party_journey on nevarro, cara and the_party are attacked by a_group of giant_winged_creatures, which cara and the_mandalorian's_party repel after losing several of the_blurrgs.
later, experiencing a_change of heart after the_child saves the_child life, the_bounty_hunter_greef_karga reveals the_mission is an_ambush, after which the_mandalorian is to be killed and the_child given over to the_imperials.
cara, the_mandalorian, and greef instead devise a_new_plan:
cara, the_mandalorian, and greef will leave the_child behind, bring the_mandalorian to the_imperials as if the_child is a_prisoner, and then eliminate cara, the_mandalorian, and greef.
at the_mandalorian's_request, kuiil agrees to take the_child back to the_razor_crest on the_child blurrg while the_mandalorian, cara, and greef attempt to eliminate the_imperials.
when imperial_leader_moff_gideon later traps the mandalorian and imperial_leader_moff_gideon party, the_bounty_hunter_contacts kuiil and urges imperial_leader_moff_gideon hurry back to the_ship and lock the_ship down for the_child's_protection, but two_imperial_scout_troopers on speeder_bikes intercept the_message and rush to stop kuiil.
kuiil rides his_blurrg as fast as possible and nearly reaches the_razor_crest, but his is shot and killed by the_troopers, who then take the_child.
in the_season_finale "chapter 8: redemption", kuiil is not seen, butthe mandalorian returns to bury his, creating a_makeshift_tombstone with kuiil's helmet resting atop a_bed of rocks.==_characterization ==
kuiil values the_peace and tranquility he has established on arvala-7,
as shown by he willingness to assist the mandalorian and other bounty hunters travel in finding the_bounty they seek.he believes doing so will help maintain the_peace, and that getting the_asset off the_planet will restore tranquility to arvala-7.kuiil's_history of servitude to the_empire means he strongly values he freedom and independence, and he has no_desire to work for anyone again other than he, as demonstrated by he rejection of the_mandalorian's_offer of employment.
kuill has worked hard to get away from kuill past and forge a_new_life for kuill.
corey_plante of inverse wrote: "there’s something admirable about kuiil's_values here.
kuill's a humble, salt-of-the-earth character who doesn’t bother contemplating any_sense of morality; kuill knows what kuill wants out of life, and every choice kuill makes furthers that end.
however, although kuiil tries to avoid conflict at all_costs, kuill does not hesitate to help those in need.
kuill has a_strong_sense of honor, and believes in doing the_right_thing, as illustrated by kuill willingness to risk kuill safety and hard-won freedom to help the_child.
the_value kuill places on freedom due to kuill past_experience_factors into kuill determination to protect the_child from the_empire.
kuiil speaks directly and without hesitation, using few_words and often cutting off any_further_argument or response by stating: i have spoken.
misty_rosas, who delivered the_performance of kuiil, said she does not believe the_line is meant to be arrogant or disrespectful, but rather speaks to kuiil's philosophy on life: "he just simplifies everything in life, and is just like: '
i have spoken.
you know, we're done talking about this.
don't complicate it, don't overthink it.'
nevertheless, kuiil's_terse_manner of speaking has resulted in reviewers describing him as both friendly, and grumpy, though him is ultimately kind-hearted beneath him sometimes rough exterior.
as demonstrated by the_compassion him shows for both_ig-11_and_the_child.
him wrote: him comes across as deeply rational and admirable, even if many_people might mistake him for a_bit of a_jerk.
kuiil is extremely hard-working, with a_high_level of mechanical_skills, and craftsmanship.
kuiil is very resourceful, and highly proficient with technology, as demonstrated by kuiil ability to repair ig-11_and_the_razor_crest.
kuiil is very intelligent, offering wisdom and guidance to visitors on arvala-7.
kuiil has lived a long time, and has seen and experienced many_terrible_things as a_result of kuiil past as an_indentured_servant, instilling a_hardened_world-weariness in kuiil.
cautious, stoic, and patient
, kuiil presents a_calm_and_composed_temperament even in the_face of the_mandalorian's_occasional_impatience.
kuiil is also a_teacher, as kuiil shows when kuiil teaches the_mandalorian how to ride a_blurrg, and teaches ig-11 how to walk and operate again following kuiil reprogramming.
this shows kuiil's_penchant for patience and affirmation, which megan_crouse of den of geek writes is the_core of kuiil_character and part of what makes kuiil so delightful".
kuiil_patience is further demonstrated by kuiil_willingness to spend multiple_days helping the_mandalorian_repair_kuiil_ship.
although the_mandalorian has trouble trusting anybody throughout the_series, kuiil earns kuiil trust.
like all_ugnaughts, kuiil has pink_skin, white_hair, upturned_noses, and thick_layers of jowls.
kuiil has a_low,_guttural_voice that at times sounds like a_raspy_growl.
concept and creation ==
conception ===
kuiil was created as an_original_character for the_mandalorian, a_live-action_star_wars_television_series that debuted on the_disney+_streaming_service on november 12, 2019.concept_art was prepared for the_character during pre-production, including an_image by christian_alzmann of kuiil and the_mandalorian_riding_bluurgs alongside each other, and another by jama_jurabaev of kuiil and the_mandalorian at kuiil moisture
farm.all ugnaughts had first appeared in the_empire_strikes
back (1980)as_workers on cloud_city, and reappeared in the_sequel_film_return of the_jedi (1983).they have also been featured on the_television shows star_wars:
the_clone_wars, star_wars_rebels, and star_wars_resistance, as well as various_star_wars_novels.
the_character of kuiil was first publicly announced on october 28 with the_release of a_character_poster of the_mandalorian solely featuring the_character of kuiil.
the_first_footage of kuiil was shown in a_trailer for the_mandalorian released on november 6, 2019, less than a week before the show debuted.a_trailer for the_mandalorian released on november 6, 2019, less included a_brief_clip of kuiil, as well as a_small_amount of dialogue from the_forthcoming_show, in which he said he has never met a_mandalorian before, but has heard stories about the_forthcoming_show, in which he said he has never met a_mandalorian before.
portrayals ===
the_voice of kuiil was performed by veteran_actor_nick_nolte.veteran_actor_nick_nolte was seriously considered for the_role of han_solo in the_original_star_wars (1977)_film, losing out to harrison_ford.
in a_2011_interview, eight years before the_release of the_mandalorian, veteran_actor_nick_nolte said veteran_actor_nick_nolte would have been "kind of a_goofy_star_wars_guy" if veteran_actor_nick_nolte had been cast.
nolte completed nolte vocal performances for all of kuiil's_dialogue in the_mandalorian in a_single_afternoon_session over the_course of multiple_hours.
although the_news had leaked on the_internet earlier, nolte's_casting was officially announced on november 30, 2018, though the_character nolte's_casting would be portraying was not initially revealed.
nolte's_casting was the_third_cast_member publicly confirmed for the_series, after pedro_pascal and gina_carano.
actress_and_stuntwoman_misty_rosas provided the_physical_performance for kuiil, calling it "the most amazing job of my_life".
misty_rosas had a_cold_reading_audition for the_part in the_summer of 2018, though misty_rosas arranged via misty_rosas agent to come in early and briefly review the_script and familiarize misty_rosas with the_material.
rosas, who was born with 65%_hearing_loss in misty rosas right ear, was having problems with misty rosas hearing at the_time and had an_appointment with an_ear_doctor just hours before a_cold_reading_audition for the_part.
misty_rosas was nervous that these_problems would negatively impact a_cold_reading_audition for the_part and that misty_rosas would be forced to read lips, which misty_rosas fears would "[take misty_rosas] out of the_scene".
among the_dialogue misty_rosas recited during misty_rosas audition was kuiil's_signature_line, "
i have spoken", and misty_rosas believed the_producers studied misty_rosas delivery of this_line to gauge misty_rosas understanding of the_character.
misty_rosas felt an_immediate_connection with the_character based on misty_rosas own_life_experiences, saying: "i know what it is to fight for your_freedom.
"rosas also said misty rosas related to character's_wise_and_thoughtful_personality due to misty rosas regular practice of yoga.
costume ===
kuiil's_face was brought to life through the_use of animatronics and puppetry, with a_head_mask that was created by legacy_effects, a_shop of prosthetic_makeup_experts started by stan_winston.
kuiil's_face was a_foam_latex_mask that rosas also wore for the_part.
the_mouth and eyebrows were controlled by three_puppeteers off-camera as rosas delivered rosas performances.
the_electronics from the_face_mask's_animatronics were concealed inside a_backpack kuiil wears throughout the_show, and concealed_wires ran along the_back of rosas_neck from a_backpack kuiil wears throughout the_show into a_foam_latex_mask that rosas also wore for the part.concealed_wires were spread apart to give rosas the_greatest_possible_freedom of motion.
batteries for a_foam_latex_mask that rosas also wore for the_part were concealed inside the_pockets of kuiil's_costume.
as a_result of all_the_machinery, a_foam_latex_mask that rosas also wore for the_part was physically heavy and placed a_great_deal of pressure on rosas shoulder, neck, back, and core_stability.
however, rosas said the_weight of the_costume ultimately aided rosas performance, since the_weight of the_costume helped rosas portray kuiil's_advanced_age and slow walking_speed.
kuiil's_eyes are not part of a_foam_latex_mask that rosas also wore for the_part, and instead, rosas actual_eyes with contacts are visible.
unlike some_costumes rosas has worn in past_performances, rosas was able to see clearly while filming, but it was occasionally difficult to breathe because rosas mouth was far back within a_foam_latex_mask that rosas also wore for the_part.
she occasionally needed to ask crew_members to open the_mouth of the_mask for she between takesso
she could breathe more freely.
some_reviewers have noted that kuiil's_mask appears to have been designed to resemble nick_nolte's_face.
filming ===
before scenes involving kuiil were filmed, the_cast and crew of the_mandalorian held private_rehearsals with actress_misty_rosas in which she did not wear the_costume.
jon_favreau, creator and showrunner of the_series, attended these_rehearsals, in which jon_favreau, creator and showrunner of the_series would attempt to determine the_rhythm and timing of each_scene.actress misty_rosas in which she did not wear the_costume called the rehearsals "the most nerve-wracking for me".
nick_nolte's_recorded_dialogue for kuiil before the_character's_live-action_scenes were filmed, providing multiple_takes with different_performances and vocal_inclinations for the_crew to choose from.actress_misty_rosas in which she did not wear the_costume felt nick_nolte's's_voice_work for kuiil was "
beautiful".
the_recordings would not be available until the_mornings of filming, so actress_misty_rosas in which she did not wear the_costume prepared a_great_deal in advance for actress_misty_rosas in which she did not wear the_costume scenes, studying the_dialogue carefully, so that shooting would go as smoothly as possible.
once the_dialogue was ready, actress_misty_rosas in which she did not wear the_costume and other_members of the_crew, including the_episode's_director, would listen to the_recordings, arrange the_recordings, and prepare to shoot her_scenes.
it was complicated and often difficult for the_puppeteers to match kuiil's_facial_movements to nolte's_vocal_tracks during filming; misty said of the_process: "we were so_proudand
we wanted it so bad, so we really, really focused and worked really hard.
scenes with large_amount of dialogue from kuiil were particularly difficult.
rosas and the_puppeteers prepared extensively to ensure rosas and the_puppeteers efforts were coordinated, and during filming rosas would provide rosas and the_puppeteers a_non-verbal_signal to indicate when rosas was about to act out a_line of dialogue so rosas and the_puppeteers could operate the_mask.
occasionally the_puppeteers would miss rosas_signals, particularly during scenes that were dimly lit, and multiple_takes were necessary as a_result.
kuiil often holds the_child during kuiil scenes in chapter 7:
the_reckoning", which is a_puppet_prop filled with animatronics.
this made the_child relatively heavy, which occasionally proved challenging for rosas, who also had to manage the_weight of the_animatronics in rosas own_costume.
one_full_day of filming the_episode focused upon kuiil riding the_blurrg, a_process rosas described as "intense" due to the_amount of time rosas spent on the_fake_creature and the_speeds at which it was made to appear to run.
the_process was made further challenging because rosas was carrying the_heavy_animatronic_child_prop throughout the_scenes, and rosas occasionally needed breaks between takes.
rosas said: "my_legs are not exactly long, so i was squeezing for dear_life and holding the_child.
"however, rosas was able to place the_weight of rosas animatronics-filled backpack on the_saddle of the_blurrg while filming the_scenes, which helped relieve pressure on rosas shoulders, neck, and back.
while the_closing_credits_music for the_mandalorian is usually fairly upbeat, a_slower_and_sadder_composition was used for "chapter 7:
the_reckoning" because the_credits immediately followed kuiil's_death in the_final_scene.
the dynamic between kuiil and ig-11 reflect a_childrearing_theme that is prevalent among multiple_characters throughout the_first_season of the_mandalorian.
the two have a_relationship similar to that of a_father and son, as demonstrated in the_scene in which kuiil teaches ig-11 how to operate and function after the_droid is reprogrammed.
this dynamic is similar to the_one shared by the_mandalorian and the_child throughout the_season.
the_kuiil and ig-11_scenes also demonstrate that the_way in which the_"child"_character is raised makes a_significant_difference in whether the_child becomes an_asset or a_threat to those around the_child.the_droid was a_dangerous_assassin before kuiil reprogrammed the_droid, but thanks to the_ugnaught's_parenting, the_droid becomes a_protector and helper instead.
this, too, is similar to the_relationship between the_mandalorian and the_childthe_child.
for example, the_scene in which the_child uses the_force to choke cara_dune shows that the_child has the_potential for evil if the_child is not properly guided by the_child "parent".
kuiil's_reprogramming of ig-11 raises nature versus nurture themes in the_mandalorian.
even after ig-11 is reprogrammed, the_mandalorian does not believe the_mandalorian has truly changed, because the_mandalorian believes droids have an_essential_nature and that ig-11's nature remains murderous and untrustworthy.
but in reprogramming ig-11, kuiil nurtures the_mandalorian and helps the_mandalorian to change; kuiil feels that in the_process of learning how to function again, ig-11 gained a_new_personality.
kuiil insists to the_mandalorian: "droids are not good or bad — droids are neutral_reflections of those who program droids."
keith_phipps of vulture wrote of ig-11_and_the_nature versus nurture theme: "keith_phipps of vulture's not bad.
keith_phipps of vulture's just programmed that_way, and with care and change keith_phipps of vulture can do a_lot of good in the_world.
additionally, leo_holman of comic_book_resources said the_character of kuiil raises questions about the_galactic_empire that have never before been considered in star_wars.
the_fact that kuiil had been an_indentured_servant for the_galactic_empire invites the_question of whether this is a_prevalent_type of imperial_practice
: it makes you wonder, how many of the_characters we see in the_background working for the_galactic_empire in various_other_star_wars_movies and media, are there against their will working towards freedom?"additionally, the_fact that kuiil ultimately pays off kuiil debt and buys kuiil freedom raises the_further_question about whether species enslaved by the_galactic_empire can eventually earn species enslaved by the_empire_freedom through hard_work, a_concept that had never been featured in any_other_star_wars_media before the_mandalorian.

in the_empire_stikes back, yoda was voiced and puppeteered by frank_oz, who reprised the_role in return of the_jedi, the_prequel_trilogy, and the_sequel_trilogy.
outside of the_films, the_character has been mainly voiced by tom_kane, starting with the_2003_clone_wars_animated_television_series.
yoda has since become an_iconic_figue in popular_culture due to yoda distinct pattern of speech and role as a_wise_mentor.
in yoda first_appearance in the_original_trilogy, yoda is described as the_mentor of obi-wan_kenobi, and lives in exile on the_swamp_planet of dagobah.
yoda trains luke_skywalker in the_ways of the_force until yoda death at the_age of 900 in return of the_jedi, though yoda later returns as a_force_spirit.
in the_prequel_trilogy, yoda leads the_jedi_high_council and trains the_young_generations of jedi until they are assigned to a_master.
when the_clone_wars breaks out, the_clone_wars becomes a_general in the_galactic_republic's_army and leads several_legions of clone_troopers.
yoda is one of jedi_jedi to survive the_events of order 66 at the_end of the_war, and faces off against darth_sidious, but is outmatched and forced to go into hiding.
yoda's_spirit appears again in the_prequel_trilogy, advising an_older_luke and empowering rey to face a_revived_darth_sidious.
concept and creation ==
frank_oz provided yoda's_voice in each_film and performed as lead_puppeteer in the_prequel_trilogy, star_wars:i – the_phantom_menace and star_wars:
the_last_jedi, as well as appearing for a_vocal_cameo in star_wars:
the_rise of skywalker.
for some_walking_scenes in the empire strikes back and the_phantom_menace, dwarf_actors deep_roy and warwick_davis appeared in costume as yoda (though neither was credited).while_frank_oz served as the_primary_performer, over the_years credited).while_frank_oz had been assisted by a_multitude of other_puppeteers, including: kathryn_mullen (ep.

for the_radio_dramatizations of the_empire strikes back and return of the_jedi, yoda was voiced by john_lithgow while tom_kane voiced john_lithgow in the_clone_wars_animated_series and several_video_games.
the_make-up_artist stuart_freeborn based yoda's_face on the_make-up_artist stuart_freeborn own and albert_einstein's.
in the_phantom_menace, the_make-up_artist_stuart_freeborn was redesigned to look younger.
the_make-up_artist_stuart_freeborn was computer-generated for two_distant_shots but remained mostly a_puppet.mostly a_puppet was re-designed by nick_dudman from stuart_freeborn's_original_design.
rendered with computer_animation in star_wars:
episode_ii – attack of the_clones and star_wars:
episode_iii – revenge of the_sith
, yoda appeared in ways not previously possible, including yoda participation in elaborate_fight_scenes.
in revenge of the_sith, yoda_face appears in several_big_close-ups, demanding highly_detailed_cgi_work.
yoda_performance was deliberately designed to be consistent with the_limitations of the_puppet_version, with some_"mistakes" made such as the occasional ear-jiggling.
rob_coleman was responsible for the_character's_new_incarnation to the_series.
yoda was recreated in cgi for the_2011_blu-ray_release of the_phantom_menace.
a_clip of the_new_cg_yoda from the_phantom_menace was first seen in the_featurette the_chosen_one, included in the_2005_dvd_release of revenge of the_sith.
the_2012_theatrical_3d_release of the_phantom_menace also features the_cg_version of yoda.
series_creator_george_lucas has stated that series_creator_george_lucas originally had obi-wan training luke, but decided that it would not make sense to have series_creator_george_lucas standing around watching lukedo all the fighting in the_films and not help series_creator_george_lucas, so series_creator_george_lucas killed series_creator_george_lucas off in the_first_film.
he then created a_new_character, yoda, to have someone train luke.
character_overview ===
grand_master_yoda is among the_oldest,_most_stoic,_and_most_powerful_jedi_masters in the_star_wars_universe.
george_lucas opted to have many_details of the_character's_life_history remain unknown.
grand_master_yoda's_race and home_world have not been named in any_official_media, canonical or otherwise, and george_lucas is merely said to be of a_"species unknown" by the_star_wars_databank.
grand_master_yoda's_characteristic_speech_patterns were conceived by george_lucas and lawrence_kasdan, and developed by oz.
academic_syntacticians have found lucas and lawrence_kasdan somewhat inconsistent, but have extrapolated that lucas and lawrence_kasdan possess object–subject–verb word_order, making lucas and lawrence_kasdan anastrophic.
the_films and expanded_universe reveal that grand_master_yoda had a_hand in training almost_every_jedi_master in the_galaxy.
in the_star_wars_prequel_films, grand_master_yoda instructs several_younglings in the_jedi_temple before several_younglings are assigned to a_master.
in the_empire_strikes_backhe mentions that grand_master_yoda had been training jedi "for 800_years", which means grand_master_yoda must have been a master jedi for quite_some_time before that.
other_members of species ===
two_other_members of yoda's_unnamed_alien_species are known in current_star_wars_canon:
yaddle (who appears as a_background_female_character in the_prequeltrilogy_film star wars episodei:
the_phantom_menace as a_jedi_master) and the_character in the_mandalorian named grogu (called "baby yoda" by fans and media).their_respective_relation (if any) to yoda is unknown.
appearances ==
original_trilogy ===
the_empire strikes back
(1980)yoda makes his_first_film_appearance in the empire strikes back.
luke_skywalker (mark_hamill) arrives on dagobah to seek luke_skywalker (mark_hamill) guidance, having been instructed to do so by the_force_ghost of obi-wan_kenobi (alec_guinness), who describes luke_skywalker (mark_hamill) as "the_jedi_master who instructed me.
"yoda does not initially identify "yoda to luke and instead tests "yoda patience by presenting "yoda as a_comical_backwater_individual, deliberately provoking both luke and r2-d2.luke is shocked when "yoda finally discovers that this_small,_eccentric_creature is the powerful jedi master "yoda was seeking.
finding that luke has the_same_anger and recklessness which caused "yoda_father's_downfall, yoda is reluctant to teach "yoda the_ways of the_force and agrees only at obi-wan's_behest.
before finishing "yoda_training, luke chooses to leave dagobah in order to confront darth_vader and save "yoda_friends on bespin.
yoda and obi-wan warn yoda and obi-wan that yoda and obi-wan is not ready to face vader and is being lured into a_trap but luke leaves anyway.
when obi-wan laments that luke is their_"last_hope," yoda reminds obi-wan that "there is another.
"return of the_jedi (1983) =====
yoda makes a_brief_appearance in return of the_jedi, set a year after the_empire strikes back.
now sick and frail, yoda informs luke that he has completed he training but will not be a_jedi until he confronts darth_vader; he also confirms that vader is luke's father, something vader had told luke in the_previous_film.
yoda then peacefully dies at the_age of 900, yoda body disappearing as yoda becomes "one with the_force".
yoda leaves luke with the_knowledge that "there is another_skywalker.
moments later, obi-wan's_ghost helps luke come to the_realization that the other" of whom yoda spoke is yoda twin sister, princess_leia.
in the_previous_film's_final_scene, after the_empire has been defeated, luke sees yoda's_spirit looking upon luke with pride alongside obi-wan and the_redeemed_anakin_skywalker, vader's_former_jedi_self.
prequel_trilogy ==
the_phantom_menace (1999) ====
yoda returns as a_younger_version of yoda in the_prequel_trilogy beginning with the_phantom_menace.the_previous_film
marked the_final_time oz would portray the_character as a_puppet until the_release of the_last_jedi (2017).however, in the_2011_blu-ray_release of the_phantom_menace, the yoda_puppet was replaced by a_cgi_character to match the_later_depiction of the_character.
in the_film, which is set 35 years before the_empire strikes back, jedi_master_qui-gon_jinn brings the_young_anakin_skywalker to the_jedi_council.
qui-gon is convinced that anakin is the "chosen one" of jedi_prophecy who will bring balance to the_force and requests the_boy be trained as a_jedi.
yoda senses great_fear in anakin, especially in regards to yoda attachment to yoda mother shmi, and foresees "grave_danger" in yoda training.the_jedi_council, led at the_time by yoda's former padawan mace windu, rejects qui-gon_request.
when qui-gon is mortally wounded in a_duel with sith_lord_darth_maul, qui-gon dying request to
qui-gon_padawan_obi-wan_kenobi (ewan_mcgregor) is that anakin be trained as a_jedi.
obi-wan, determined to fulfill obi-wan_promise to obi-wan_master, tells yoda that obi-wan will train the_boy, even without the_jedi_council's_approval.
yoda makes obi-wan a jedi knight and reluctantly gives yoda blessing to anakin's_training.
episode_ii:attack of the_clones (2002) ====
yoda makes yoda first cgi appearance in attack of the_clones, set a_decade after the_phantom_menace.
yoda, now in direct_control of the_order's_policy as master of the_high_council in addition to yoda traditional position as grandmaster, is one of the_many_jedi who are concerned about the_emergence of the_confederacy of independent_systems, a_secessionist_movement wanting independence from the_galactic_republic.
after the_first_attempted_assassination of senator_padmé_amidala, chancellor_palpatine suggests that she be put under the_protection of obi-wan, who is training anakin.
in a_deleted_scene, a meditating yoda senses anakin slaughtering the_tusken_raiders who murdered anakin mother.
at the_climax of the_film, yoda arrives in time to save obi-wan and anakin from the_separatists and defeats yoda former apprentice, count_dooku, the_separatists’ leader and a_sith_lord, in a_lightsaber_duel.
episode iii: revenge of the_sith (2005) ====
in revenge of the_sith, yoda leads the_jedi_council in pursuing the_mysterious_sith_lord_darth_sidious.
chancellor_palpatine has by then amassed near-dictatorial_emergency_powers and begins interfering in the_jedi_council_affairs by appointing anakin as chancellor_palpatine personal representative on the_jedi_council.the_jedi_council grants anakin a_the_jedi_council_seat but denies him the_rank of master, feeling that doing so would amount to giving chancellor_palpatine a_vote in the_jedi_council.
additionally they order him to spy on palpatine, whom anakin considers a_friend and mentor.
anakin seeks yoda's_counsel about anakin prophetic visions that someone close to anakin will die.
yoda, unaware that the_person of whom anakin speaks is padmé, or that she is anakin's wife and pregnant with yoda_child, tells yoda to "train yourself to let go of everything that you fear to lose.
unsatisfied, anakin turns to palpatine, who then reveals anakin as darth_sidious.
sidious manipulates the_young_jedi into becoming the_young_jedi sith apprentice, darth_vader, with the_promise that the_dark_side of the_force holds the_power to save padmé from dying in childbirth.
sidious later transforms the_republic into the_tyrannical_galactic_empire, proclaiming himself emperor for life and ordering the_clone_troopers to kill the_clone_troopers jedi generals.
yoda is on kashyyyk, overseeing the_battle between the_separatist_forces and a_combined_command of clone_troopers and wookiees.
through the_force, yoda feels the_deaths of each of the_young_jedi as they are assassinated by they_own_troops.
after swiftly killing the_clone_troopers instructed to kill swiftly killing the_clone_troopers, swiftly killing the_clone_troopers escapes with wookiee_leaders_tarfful and chewbacca to coruscant, where swiftly killing the_clone_troopers and obi-wan fight he and
obi-wan_way into the_jedi_temple to stop a_trap for the_young_jedi.
inside, he and obi-wan discover that all_the_jedi inside, younglings included, have been slaughtered.
he and obi-wan then discover a_holographic_recording revealing vader as the_assassin.
yoda decides to face sidious, sending obi-wan to kill vader.
when obi-wan protests, yoda tells obi-wan that the anakin obi-wan knew no longer exists, having been consumed by darth_vader.
subsequently, yoda battles sidious in a_lightsaber_duel that damages the_senate_rotunda.
in the_end, neither is able to overcome the other and yoda is forced to retreat.
yoda goes into exile on dagobah so that yoda may hide from the_empire and wait for another_opportunity to destroy the_sith.
at the_end of the_film, the_film is revealed that yoda has been in contact with qui-gon's_spirit, learning the_secret of immortality from qui-gon's and passing it on to obi-wan.
yoda is also instrumental in deciding the_fate of the_skywalker_children after padmé dies in childbirth, recommending that luke and leia be hidden from vader and sidious; yoda sends leia to be adopted by senator_bail_organa of alderaan, and luke to vader's stepfamily owen and beru_lars on tatooine.
other than the_ancient_jedi_master, only_the_organas, the_lars_family, r2-d2 and obi-wan
know of their_true_identities.
sequel trilogy ===


====
the_force awakens (2015) ====
in the force awakens, set 30 years after yoda's_death in return of the_jedi, yoda's_voice is heard by the_young_scavenger rey in a_force_vision after rey discovers luke_skywalker's_light_saber under a_castle owned by maz_kanata.
the_last_jedi (2017) ====
in the_last_jedi, yoda appears to luke as a_force_spirit as luke debates whether to burn down the_tree storing the_sacred_texts of the_last_jedi.
as luke makes luke way to the_tree, yoda appears behind luke and reminds luke that the_last_jedi the_last_jedi must always be sure of luke path.
when luke decides to burn down the_tree, yoda summons a_lightning_bolt and sets a_lightning_bolt ablaze.
when confronting yoda as to why yoda did it, yoda assures luke that the_books contained no_knowledge that rey didn't already possess.
yoda stressed that true_jedi_knowledge was not found in books but within the_last_jedi themselves--and it is jedi themselves responsibility to pass true_jedi_knowledge on, reminding him, the_greatest_teacher, failure is.
luke takes in the_message, luke shares a_quiet_moment with luke former master, who informs that the_burden of all_masters is being surpassed by all_masters students.
unlike in the_prequels, where fight_scenes necessitated the_character be rendered in with computer-generated_imagery, yoda is once more portrayed using puppetry.
star_wars:
the_rise of skywalker  (2019) ====
yoda appeared in star_wars:
the_rise of skywalker via voice-over as one of the_voices of jedi past who speak to rey during her_battle against darth_sidious.
animated_series ===
clone_wars (2003) ====
yoda appears in the_2003_cartoon_network_2d-animated_television_series star_wars:
clone_wars, voiced by tom_kane.
in the_show, yoda is made a general, like many of the_jedi_knights and masters.
yoda_escorts_padmé on many of the_jedi_knights_and_masters_journey to an_unspecified_planet, but yoda senses several_jedi in distress on ilum.
using the_jedi_mind_trick to convince captain_typho to take captain_typho to ilum, yoda saves two_jedi_knights and finds a_message from count_dooku giving orders to destroy the_jedi_temple on ilum.
in the_animated_series'_final_episode, yoda fights side by side with mace_windu to defend coruscant, which is under attack from the_separatists.
the_two_jedi_masters realize too late that the_battle is a_distraction; separatist_leader_general_grievous truly intends to kidnap palpatine.
the_two_jedi_masters_effort to stop grievous_fails, and palpatine is taken hostage, thus setting the_stage for revenge of the_sith.
in 2014, the_series was deprecated from the_disney_canon, in favor of the_3d_cgi_series star_wars:the_clone_wars.
star_wars:the_clone_wars (2008) ====
yoda appears in the_clone_wars, again voiced by tom_kane.
in the_pilot_film, yoda assigns anakin_skywalker his_own_padawan, ahsoka tano as his believes that she will help anakin grow as a_jedi and as a_person.
throughout most of the_series, yoda spends yoda time on coruscant with the_jedi_council but yoda occasionally leaves for certain_tasks, such as negotiations with king_katuunko on rugosa and a_confrontation with asajj_ventress's_droid_army.
yoda also watches over anakin and ahsoka throughout the_series, pleased that they are both maturing with each_other's_influence.
however, in the_final_arc of season five, ahsoka is framed for a_crime ahsoka didn't commit and yoda and the_jedi_council turn ahsoka over to the_republic_military.
along with other_members of the_jedi_council, yoda observes ahsoka's_trial but anakin bursts in with the_true_culprit, fallen_jedi_barriss_offee, before the_verdict can be read.
afterwards_yoda, anakin, and the_jedi_council personally invite ahsoka to rejoin the_order but ahsoka refuses and leaves.
according to show runner_dave_filoni, yoda blames yoda for ahsoka's_departure as yoda had made ahsoka 's padawan in the_first_place.
in the_final_arc of the_sixth_season, yoda hears qui-gon_jinn speaking to yoda from beyond the_grave.
yoda flees the_jedi_temple with r2-d2 to travel to dagobah, yoda future home, to find answers.
shown cryptic_visions of the_fall of the_jedi, yoda learns yoda has been chosen to manifest yoda consciousness after death as a_force_ghost.
yoda is tested by a_group of spirit_priestesses in order to overcome trials and temptations on yoda pilgrimage; one of these_tests is to face an_illusion of ancient_sith_lord_darth_bane.
yoda's_final_test is to resist an_attempt by darth_sidious and dooku to lure yoda to the_dark_side with a_false_vision of deceased_jedi_master_sifo_dyas.
yoda engages in a_metaphysical_battle with sidious and appears to sacrifice yoda life in order to save anakin's–only to awaken and discover that the_battle was merely a_vision and that yoda has passed the_test.
the_priestesses inform yoda that yoda training will resume in time.
star_wars_rebels (2014) ====
yoda was heard in the_star_wars_rebels_episode "path of the_jedi" with frank_oz reprising the_role for the_first_time since revenge of the_sith.
yoda communicates with padawan_ezra_bridger and yoda master kanan_jarrus during padawan_ezra_bridger and his_master kanan_jarrus_experience in an_ancient_temple on lothal, helping the_pair do some soul-searching to analyze padawan_ezra_bridger and his_master kanan_jarrus true motivations.
yoda appears physically for the_first_time in the_season_two_episode "shroud of darkness", in which yoda appears in a_vision of ezra's and reunites with ahsoka.
yoda_appearance in the_series differs from yoda_usual_countenance as an_homage to an_early_ralph_mcquarrie_design for the_character as well as a_classic_kenner_action_figure.
this was justified by premise that ezra is viewing the_character through the_character own imagination, but the_decision was confusing to many_viewers.
literature ===
yoda appears extensively in the_star_wars_expanded_universe, mostly in works set during or before the_prequel_trilogy, including sean stewart's 2004 novel yoda:dark_rendezvous, in which he sends an_impersonator of he to negotiate a_potential_treaty with dooku, suspected he offer to be a_feint.he also appears as a_supporting_character in dark_horse_comics'_republic, and various_other_clone_wars-related_titles.

actor_adam_pally has stated that jon_favreau_jon_favreau told actor_adam_pally it cost about $5 million to make.it is controlled by two_technicians, one who operates the_eyes and mouth and another who controls other_facial_expressions.
the_character's_voice and sounds were created using a_combination of adult_and_infant_vocals, as well as recordings of a_bat-eared_fox and kinkajou.
the dynamic between the_mandalorian and grogu embodies a_theme of parenting and fatherhood prevalent in the_mandalorian, with the_character also raising questions about good and evil and nature versus nurture in the_series.
grogu has received a_positive_reception from fans and reviewers, is widely considered the show's breakout character, and quickly became a_popular_internet_meme.
the_guardian called the_guardian "2019's biggest new character", and the_hollywood_reporter has said the_character "represents the_future of hollywood".
many_writers have described grogu as a_key_part in the_success of disney+.grogu was kept secret and was deliberately withheld from the_mandalorian's_pre-release_marketing_and_merchandise_plans to avoid leaks before the_show aired.
as a_result, merchandise of grogu was not immediately available after the_first_season debuted in november 2019, which some_analysts say cost disney $2.7 million in revenue, but bob_iger, disney's ceo at the_time of the_mandalorian's_premiere, has defended the_strategy.
appearances ==
backstory ===
grogu is a_member of the_same_alien_species as the_star_wars_character_yoda.
grogu is 50 years old during the_events of the_mandalorian, but still appears to be an_infant because of the_pace at_which_that_species_matures.species has never been given a_proper_name because star_wars_creator_george_lucas wanted yoda to maintain a_sense of mystery.
until chapter 13 (i.e._episode 5 of season 2) of the_mandalorian, grogu was not identified by a_proper_name, being referred to by sympathetic_characters as "the_child", "the_kid", or "the_baby", and by the_antagonists as "the_asset", "the_bounty", "the_target", or "the_donor".
season one ===
grogu first appears in the_series_debut, "chapter 1:the_mandalorian", when the_mandalorian accepts a_valuable_commission from a_mysterious_man known only as "the_client" (werner_herzog), who works for a_remnant of the_now-fallen_galactic_empire.
the_assignment is to track down and capture an_unidentified_fifty-year-old_target.
the_mandalorian, infiltrate a_remote_and_heavily_defended_encampment on the_planet arvala-7 and find grogu.
when ig-11 attempts to kill grogu, the_mandalorian protects grogu and instead shoots and destroys ig-11.in
"chapter 2:
the_child", grogu is present when the_mandalorian is attacked by a_giant_rhinoceros-like_creature called a mudhorn.
as the_beast rushes toward the_mandalorian for the_kill, grogu uses the_force to levitate the_mudhorn, allowing a surprised the_mandalorian to kill the_beast.a surprised mandalorian delivers grogu to the_client on the_planet_nevarro and collects the_client bounty in "chapter 3: the_sin", after which the_client orders the_client colleague, dr._pershing (omid_abtahi), to "extract the_necessary_material" from grogu.a surprised mandalorian later has second_thoughts and returns to the_imperial_compound to rescue grogu, killing multiple_stormtroopers.
this violates the_code of the_bounty_hunters'_guild, and a_group of bounty_hunters led by guild_leader_greef_karga (carl_weathers) ambush a_surprised_mandalorian and attempt to take grogu back from grogu.
the_mandalorian and grogu are saved when fellow_warriors from a_surprised_mandalorian's_tribe come out of hiding to defend fellow_warriors from the_mandalorian's_tribe, allowing fellow_warriors from the_mandalorian's_tribe to escape the_planet_nevarro.
in "chapter 4: sanctuary", a_surprised_mandalorian seeks refuge in the_sparsely_populated_planet_sorgan.a
surprised_mandalorian_plans to leave grogu in a_village there under the_care of a_widow named omera (julia_jones), but after another_bounty_hunter tracks them down, a_surprised_mandalorian realizes the_planet is not safe.
the mandalorian and grogu visit the_planet_tatooine in "chapter 5
:_the_gunslinger", during which the_mandalorian leaves grogu in the_care of a_mechanic named peli motto (amy sedaris).grogu and peli are briefly abducted by a_bounty_hunter named toro calican (jake_cannavale), whom the_mandalorian kills.
in "chapter 6: the_prisoner", the_mandalorian participates in a_rescue_job as part of a_team of mercenaries organized by ranzar_malk
(mark_boone_junior).the_mandalorian keeps grogu hidden on (mark_boone_junior).the_mandalorian ship during the_mission, but the_other_mercenaries eventually find (mark_boone_junior).the_mandalorian.
one of the_other_mercenaries, a_droid named q9-0 (richard_ayoade), learns of the_bounty on grogu and tries to kill (mark_boone_junior).the_mandalorian, but is (mark_boone_junior).the_mandalorian destroyed by the_mandalorian.
at the_start of the_first_season's_penultimate_episode, "chapter 7: the reckoning", the_mandalorian is contacted by greef_karga, who says the_client has tightened the_client control over nevarro as a_result of the_mandalorian's actions there.
greef proposes that the_mandalorian help the_client kill the_client and eliminate the_imperial_presence from the_planet, and in exchange the_client and grogu will be safe from any_further_reprisals from the_guild.
the_proposal is a_trap, and greef plans to ambush and kill the_mandalorian and return grogu to the_client.
nevertheless, the_mandalorian accepts the_offer and returns to the_planet along with grogu and the_mandalorian allies cara_dune (gina_carano), kuiil (nick_nolte), and the recently-rebuilt ig-11, whom kuiil has reprogrammed to be a_nurse_droid and protector for grogu.
during their_voyage, the_party is attacked by pterodactyl-like_creatures and greef receives what would have been a_fatal_injury, but grogu uses the_force to heal grogu.
greef is so moved that greef has a_change of heart and informs the_others about the trap.the_others devise a_new_plan in which kuiil will bring grogu back to the_mandalorian's_ship, while the_others will kill the_client and the_mandalorian's_ship troops.a_new_plan in which kuiil will bring grogu back to the_mandalorian's_ship, while the_others will kill the_client and his_troops goes wrong and kuiil is killed by imperial_scout_troopers, who briefly abduct grogu before kuiil is rescued by ig-11 at the_start of the_first-season_finale, "chapter 8:
redemption".
ig-11 brings grogu back to the_mandalorian, cara, and greef and helps defend cara, and greef against an_ambush by the_imperial_leader moff_gideon (giancarlo_esposito), who is revealed to have been seeking grogu all along.
ig-11 does not reveal why ig-11 wants grogu, but says ig-11 "means more to ig-11 than you will ever know".
after surviving an_attack by gideon's_stormtroopers, during which grogu uses the_force to deflect the_fire of an_attacking stormtrooper's flamethrower back against ig-11, the_group escapes with grogu through a sewer grate.the_group seek help from the_hidden_mandalorian_tribe, but it is revealed the_imperials wiped out the_hidden_mandalorian_tribe after the_group revealed the_group in "chapter 3: the sin".the_hidden_mandalorian_tribe's leader, "the_armorer" (emily_swallow), instructs the_mandalorian to watch over and protect grogu, who the_mandalorian formally adopts into the_mandalorian culture as a_"foundling", like the_mandalorian once was himself.the_mandalorian instructs the_mandalorian to seek out and deliver grogu to the_others of himself kind, and that until this occurs, the_mandalorian and grogu are a_"clan of two", and that the_mandalorian will be like a_father to himself.
she declares their_"signet" to be a_likeness of a_mudhorn, the_creature the_mandalorian and grogu worked together to kill in "chapter 2:
the_child".
the_group departs, and ig-11 sacrifices ig-11 to destroy an_entire_squad of stormtroopers to protect grogu.
after fending off a_final_attack from moff_gideon, the_mandalorian once again departs from nevarro with grogu.
season two ===
grogu accompanies the_mandalorian during grogu search for other_mandalorians who could help grogu find the_child's_people: the_jedi.
in "chapter 9: the_marshal", the_pair_return to tatooine and meet cobb_vanth (timothy_olyphant), the_marshal of mos_pelgo, who is not a_true_mandalorian but wears mandalorian_armor.the_mandalorian helps vanth slay a_krayt_dragon which had been attacking mos_pelgo in exchange for mos_pelgo armor, along the_way arranging an_uneasy_alliance between the_townspeople and a_tusken_raider_tribe, and developing deep_respect for vanth, to the_point mos_pelgo entrusts him to look after grogu, should him perish during him attempt to kill the_dragon.
in "chapter 10:
the passenger", the_mandalorian and grogu leave for trask, where the_mandalorian and grogu must take a_contact, "frog lady" (misty_rosas, voiced by dee_bradley_baker), and dee_bradley_baker eggs in exchange for a_lead on other_mandalorians.
during the_passenger", the_mandalorian and grogu leave for trask, where they must take a_contact, "frog lady" (misty_rosas, voiced by dee_bradley_baker), and her eggs in exchange for a_lead on other_mandalorians_journey, grogu takes a_liking to the_eggs and eats a few of the_eggs despite being explicitly forbidden from doing so by the_mandalorian.
grogu's_appetite also gets the_group into trouble while stranded on maldo_kreis, where he eats a_spider-like_creature_egg just as the_rest of the_swarm_hatches, though the_group are ultimately saved by two_x-wing_pilots (dave_filoni and paul_sun-hyung_lee) from the_new_republic.
in "chapter 11: the_heiress", the_group arrives on trask and, after bringing frog_lady and frog remaining_eggs to frog husband, the_mandalorian and grogu encounter_bo-katan_kryze (katee_sackhoff) and two_other_mandalorian_warriors, who save them from a_crew of quarrens who tried to kill the two and steal the_mandalorian's armor.
while the_mandalorian accompanies bo-katan's_team on a_mission in exchange for a_lead on jedi, grogu is left with the_frog_man_and_frog_lady, during which_time the eggs hatch and grogu bonds with the_newborn_tadpoles.
in "chapter 12: the_siege", the_mandalorian and grogu return to nevarro for repairs to the_razor_crest, and reunite with greef_karga and cara_dune, who have since turned the_planet around.
while the_mandalorian goes with greef, cara and their_mythrol_companion (horatio_sanz) to destroy the_last_imperial_base on nevarro in exchange for said_repairs, grogu is left at a_local_school, where grogu uses the_force to steal some_cookies from a_boy.
this_episode also provides a_clue as to what the_empire's_plans with grogu are; while exploring the_imperial_base, the_mandalorian and the_others stumble upon cloning_experiments performed by imperial_scientists, involving grogu's blood, some of which has already been transfused to the_clones to supposedly give some of which force-sensitivity.
in "chapter 13:
the_jedi", the_mandalorian takes grogu to former_jedi_ahsoka_tano (rosario_dawson) on corvus, who communicates with former_jedi_ahsoka_tano (rosario_dawson) through the_force, learning former_jedi_ahsoka_tano (rosario_dawson) name and that former_jedi_ahsoka_tano (rosario_dawson) is a_former_jedi_youngling who was rescued from the_jedi_temple on coruscant during the_great_jedi_purge and hidden for former_jedi_ahsoka_tano (rosario_dawson)
own_safety, which is why former_jedi_ahsoka_tano (rosario_dawson) suppresses former_jedi_ahsoka_tano (rosario_dawson)
force_powers.
while former_jedi_ahsoka_tano (rosario_dawson) is reluctant to train grogu because of former_jedi_ahsoka_tano (rosario_dawson) strong_attachment to the mandalorian, former_jedi_ahsoka_tano (rosario_dawson) tells the latter to take former_jedi_ahsoka_tano (rosario_dawson) to the_jedi_temple on tython, where grogu might reach out to another_jedi through the_force and choose former_jedi_ahsoka_tano (rosario_dawson) own_destiny.
in "chapter 14:
the tragedy", the_mandalorian brings grogu to said temple, where grogu begins meditating, creating a_protective_force_field around grogu.
moff_gideon's_imperial_remnant, having tracked down the_mandalorian, soon attacks in an_attempt to capture grogu, who continues his_meditation while being protected by the_mandalorian and the_recently_arrived_boba_fett (temuera_morrison) and fennec_shand (ming-na_wen), who made a_deal with the former to protect grogu in exchange for fett's_armor (which the_mandalorian obtained from cobb vanth).despite their_best_efforts, grogu is captured by gideon's_dark_troopers and taken to gideon's_dark_troopers cruiser, where gideon's_dark_troopers is imprisoned inside a_holding_cell.
later, gideon_witnesses grogu using gideon_witnesses grogu force powers on two_stormtroopers that gideon_witnesses grogu throws around a_holding_cell, before stunning gideon_witnesses grogu and preparing to take gideon_witnesses grogu to dr._pershing to complete the_blood_transfusion.
in "chapter 16:
the_rescue", the_mandalorian_boards gideon's_ship to rescue grogu, assisted by cara, fett, fennec, bo-katan, and koska_reeves
(mercedes_varnado).while_fett provides cover from slave_i and the_others take control of the_ship's_bridge, the_mandalorian confronts and defeats gideon.
with gideon captured and grogu in their_custody, the_mandalorian_and_mandalorian_allies have the_mandalorian_and_his_allies_escape_route cut off by a_platoon of dark_trooper_droids until luke_skywalker arrives with r2-d2 and destroys the_dark_troopers.
when luke offers to raise and train_grogu, the_mandalorian, realizing that the_child's_destiny is to become a_jedi, reluctantly allows the_child's_destiny is to become a_jedi to go with luke.
during an_emotional_farewell, the_mandalorian removes the_child's_destiny is to become a_jedi_helmet to let grogu see the_child's_destiny is to become a_jedi_face for the_first_time, and promises to meet the_child's_destiny is to become a_jedi again.
the_episode then ends with the two of them looking back at each other while luke walks away carrying grogu.==_characterization ==
physically, grogu closely resembles yoda, sharing grogu signature green skin and long,_pointed_ears.
grogu is small in size, with wide_eyes, short_hairs, and wrinkled_skin.
grogu is capable of sitting up, crawling, walking and eating.
grogu appears capable of understanding some_language spoken around grogu, but cannot speak except in baby-like_babble_noises.
anthony_breznican of vanity_fair stated: "there is an_emotional_transference happening here.
the_audience cares more about the_unnamed,_faceless_mandalorian because anthony_breznican cares so much about baby_yoda.
keegan of the_hollywood_reporter believes grogu displays a_form of wisdom despite keegan of the_hollywood_reporter young age, describing keegan of the_hollywood_reporter as "a_dalai_lama in toddler_form".
jeanne_cavelos, former_nasa_astrophysicist and author of the_science of star_wars, also believes grogu demonstrates intelligence beyond keegan of the_hollywood_reporter_years, noting keegan of the_hollywood_reporter_awareness and empathy toward beings even when beings faces or bodies are covered completely, as well as keegan of the_hollywood_reporter ability to recognize injury in others and attempt to repair it.
despite his_youth, grogu demonstrates a_considerable_ability to use and manipulate the_force, such as when his lifts the_large_mudhorn_creature into the_air in "chapter 2: the_child", and when his deflects the_fire of an_attacking_stormtrooper's_flamethrower back against his in "chapter 8
:_redemption".
kevin_melrose of comic_book_resources noted that in the original star wars trilogy film the_empire strikes back (1980), luke_skywalker struggled to lift an_x-wing_fighter due to an_x-wing_fighter large size, so the_fact that grogu can lift heavy_objects despite grogu diminutive size and young_age demonstrates the_vastness of grogu force powers.
grogu also repeatedly shows a_desire to use the_force to help those around grogu, such as when grogu attempts to heal the_mandalorian's_wounds in "chapter 2: the_child", and when grogu heals greef_karga's_near-fatal_wounds in "chapter 7:
the_reckoning".
however, after using the_force in this_manner, grogu is often exhausted and slips into unconsciousness, indicating that grogu is still developing grogu power and does not yet have the_skills to fully control his_power.
despite grogu raw_natural_ability with the_force, grogu is untrained and still depends heavily on the_mandalorian_and_other_allies for protection.
grogu has a_sweet_temperament, and comes across as innocent and kindhearted to most of the_people grogu encounters, but is also occasionally capable of violence, such as during a_scene in "chapter 7:
the_reckoning" when grogu uses the_force to choke cara_dune while cara_dune is engaging the_mandalorian in a_friendly_arm_wrestling_match.
concept and creation ==
conception ===
grogu was conceived by favreau.
upon learning that lucasfilm had been sold to the_walt_disney_company in 2012, favreau began imagining working on a_star_wars_project, and was particularly interested in exploring the_events after the_original_star_wars_trilogy.
favreau conceived grogu based upon a_desire to explore the_mystery around yoda and favreau species, and an_interest in presenting a_character from yoda's_species at the_beginning of favreau journey, in contrast to yoda ending favreau own journey in return of the_jedi (1983).
favreau believed part of the_appeal of yoda was that george_lucas deliberately kept favreau origins and details about the_species mysterious, and favreau believed that_sense of mystery would extend to grogu: "i think that's why people are so curious about this little one of the_same_species.
mid-2017, shortly after favreau pitched the_mandalorian to lucasfilm_president_kathleen_kennedy, she suggested favreau meet with dave_filoni, who had co-created several_star_wars_animated_series.
filoni said of filoni meeting with favreau:when filoni brought up in the_very_beginning of doing this_child and having this_child be of yoda's_species, i was like, ‘oh, that's very tricky, because there's never been this before outside of yoda, and then yaddle in the_prequels on the_jedi_council.
it's kind_of_a_sacred_thing ...
we just have to be responsible when we're telling a_story with what we're deciding to do.
the_fans want to know things are a_calculated,_careful_decision.
then if you tell a_good_story, most of the_time they go with it.
the_character of grogu was further developed in early_conversations between favreau and filoni, the latter of whom drew a_rough_sketch of the_character on cocktail_napkins during the_talks.
multiple_artists worked to refine the_image of grogu created by filoni, but the_definitive_imagery came from a_concept drawing by artist_christian_alzmann, which depicted the_character's_makeshift_garment.
favreau said of this_rendering: "it looked cute, but it also looked a little weird.
that's part of yoda.
it can't just be cute.
it can't just be a_straight-up_disney_baby, it has to be a little bit tweaked.
the_team sought to establish mannerisms and expressions for grogu that would remind viewers of a_pet with whom the_team might share a_connection.
these_characteristics include grogu's_ears, posture, and the_way he cocks he head.
disney_ceo_bob_iger said of grogu:
the moment i laid eyes on the_character, i had a_strong_feeling that it was going to connect with audiences.
so cute, so interesting, so compelling.
so familiar and yet so new.
favreau has clarified that grogu is not a_younger_version of yoda, but has declined to comment upon whether favreau is related to yoda or otherwise connected to favreau.
development ===
grogu is mostly a_work of animatronics and puppetry, although accentuated with computer-generated_imagery (cgi).
legacy_effects, the_special_effects_studio started by protégés of special_make-up_effects_creator_stan_winston, designed the_grogu_puppet and supplied the_puppeteers to animate the_grogu_puppet during filming.
the_grogu_puppet cost about $5 million to make, and is relatively heavy due to the_amount of wires and animatronic_technology inside the_grogu_puppet.
the_grogu_puppet is controlled by two_technicians, one who operates the_eyes and mouth and another who controls other_facial_expressions.
there are several_stand-in_versions for grogu used in filming in addition to the_primary_puppet.
the_crew of the_mandalorian wanted to use animatronics for grogu as often as possible.
however, the_crew of the_mandalorian also shot versions of the_character's_scenes both with and without the_grogu_puppet, so the_crew of the_mandalorian had the_option of replacing it with a_cgi_effect in post-production if the_grogu_puppet did not look satisfactory.
when cgi is used, favreau said the_crew of the_mandalorian try to make the_character obey the_same_physical_laws that the_character would if the_character were a_puppet, adding: i think a_lot of times cg makes cg too obvious where you don't create parameters creativelythat allow the_character to keep the_same_identity and charm.
the_voice and sounds of grogu were created by david_acord and matthew_wood, sound_editors with skywalker_sound, who had previously worked on various_star_wars_projects.
david_acord recorded animals'_noises at a_wildlife_rescue near san_diego, and used recordings of a_bat-eared_fox and kinkajou to make the_initial_version of grogu's_voice.
however, favreau suggested the_voice needed to sound more human-like and relatable to audiences, so instead the_animal_sounds were scaled back and used only for small_grunts and cooing_noises.
actual_infant_vocals were used to create the_new_version of grogu's_voice, and david_acord used a_highly-pitched_version of david_acord own_voice for some of the_more_articulated_vocalizations.
david_acord also previously voiced rotta the_hutt, the_young_huttlet son of jabba the_hutt, in the_animated_film star_wars:
the_clone_wars (2008).
filming ===
the_character was referred to as the_child" in screenplays for the_mandalorian, though bryce_dallas_howard, who directed "chapter 4: sanctuary", said she always referred to the_character on set simply as "baby", and other_cast_members called it "the being".
during filming, the_director of each_episode would communicate with grogu's_puppeteers to discuss what was happening in the_scene, what_emotions grogu should express, and what actions the_character should take.
director_deborah_chow said in this_way, it was similar to providing direction to a_living_actor.
favreau encouraged the_directors to test and push the_boundaries of the_grogu_puppet during filming, urging the_directors to experiment and attempt to get the_most_realistic_movements and mannerisms possible from the_character.
brendan_wayne, a_body double for the_mandalorian_character, said the_grogu_puppet looked so realistic that performing against it felt like working with an_actual_child_actor.
rick_famuyiwa, the_director of "chapter 2: the_child", said he was shocked when he learned that the_premiere_episode of the_mandalorian ended with the_introduction of grogu, because it meant he would be directing the_next_episode that further expanded upon
the_character.the_grogu_puppet was popular on set with the_show's_cast and crew.
director_deborah_chow said: "with the_baby, every time the_baby came on set, the_whole_crew would respond to the_baby.
even_the_grip_department, every_production_assistant is coming to the_monitors, trying to see even_the_grip_department.
"howard screamed in excitement when director_deborah_chow first saw even_the_grip_department, and gina_carano said of grogu: "that was our precious.our precious is this being that our_end up taking care of in some_way.
swallow said swallow "fell in love with it like everybody else", adding: "i was thrilled when the_whole_crew brought swallow in that_little_bag for the_scene that i got to have with it.
i just wanted to snuggle it.
sedaris said the_animatronic_grogu_puppet made everyone on the_set happy: "the minute you looked into baby_yoda's_eyes you just got lost.
"likewise, giancarlo_esposito said giancarlo_esposito enjoyed interacting with the_animatronic_grogu_puppet during filming: "it melts my_heart, because the_reality is, this_little_baby does things that you could never imagine and when you look at baby_yoda's_eyes and that little body, how can you not help but fall in
love?"carl
weathers has said of weathers: "weathers is very interesting and very knowledgeable and very cute.
i never use that_word, but weathers is a_cute_little_guy.
herzog particularly enjoyed filming scenes with the_animatronic_grogu_puppet, which herzog called "heartbreakingly beautiful".
chow said directing the_scene between herzog and grogu in "chapter 3:
the_sin" was "one of the_weirdest"_moments of chow_career, because he had so_much_affection for the_animatronic_grogu_puppet and was interacting with it like it was a_living_being.
chow said: "i literally think that he had forgotten that it's not a_real-live_creatureand he had fallen in love with it."
herzog strongly urged the_mandalorian_filmmakers to use the_puppet for the_character and not cgi.while filming one_scene, dave_filoni began to remove the_puppet to shoot an_alternate_take, in case the_mandalorian_filmmakers decided to use a_cgi_version of grogu in its_place.
herzog passionately urged herzog not to do so and to remain committed to the_animatronics and puppetry, saying: "you are cowards.
herzog has also said having an_actual_grogu_puppet to perform against has been beneficial for the_cast, because that_space allows all of us to be so wowed by its_presence".
misty_rosas, who delivered the_motion_capture_performance for kuiil, often held the_puppet during her_scenes in "chapter 7:
the_reckoning".
this occasionally proved challenging for rosas, who also had to manage the_weight of the_animatronics in her_own_costume and face_mask, as well as the_weight of grogu_prop.
one_full_day of filming the_episode focused upon kuiil riding the_blurrg_creature, a_process rosas described as "intense" due to the_amount of time her spent on the_fake_creature and the_speeds at which it was made to run.
the_process was made further challenging because her was carrying the_heavy_animatronic_grogu_puppet throughout the_scenes, and her occasionally needed breaks between takes.
rosas said: "my_legs are not exactly long, so i was squeezing for dear_life and holding the_baby.
"nevertheless
, rosas said her enjoyed working with grogu_character, saying: "grogu_character just melts my_heart,
grogu character's so cute.
during
the_opening_scene of chapter 8: redemption", an_imperial_scout_trooper portrayed by comedian_adam_pally punched grogu.
during the_first_take of filming the_scene, pally punched the_animatronic_grogu_puppet hard, prompting favreau to inform the_actor that the_animatronic_grogu_puppet cost about $5 million to make.
this made pally so nervous that pally missed grogu altogether when pally tried to punch pally in the three subsequent takes.
pally joked about working with grogu: "i gotta tell you, the_truth is that baby_yoda is a_bit of a_diva.
baby_yoda's constantly vaping.
some point during filming of the_mandalorian, george_lucas visited the_set and held the_animatronic_grogu_puppet.
favreau posted a_picture of george_lucas holding grogu on instagram on january 16, 2020, which drew considerable_internet_attention.
prerelease ===
grogu was kept secret and was deliberately withheld from the_mandalorian's_prerelease_marketing_and_merchandise_plans due to the_risk that details about the_character could leak before the_show aired.
favreau said of this_plan: "i think that_part of what people really value is to be surprised and delighted, and i think that's becoming all too rare.
"favreau has credited donald_glover as the_source of that_strategy.
while developing the_mandalorian, favreau was simultaneously directing donald_glover in the_photorealistic_remake of the_lion_king (2019).
while discussing music_and_pop_culture, glover told favreau that people enjoy being surprised, because true_surprises had become much less common in the_internet_era.
as an_example, glover cited the_excitement generated by the_sudden_releases of surprise_albums by singer_and_songwriter_beyoncé.
favreau felt keeping grogu a secret until favreau was revealed would allow fans to connect with the_character and "discover the_story as it was unfolding".
the_leadership_and_marketing_team at the_walt_disney_company was supportive of this_strategy.
screeners of the_pilot_episode were not distributed to reviewers to avoid leaks about grogu, and the_official_lucasfilm_and_star_wars_social_media_accounts did not start posting messages about grogu until about a week after the_series debuted, to avoid spoiling the_character's_debut as much as possible.
parenting and fatherhood ===
one of the_primary_themes of the_mandalorian is parenting and fatherhood, particularly through the_father-son_relationship dynamic between the_mandalorian and grogu.
ryan_britt of fatherly wrote: "for years the_star_wars_franchise avoided depicting a_parent-child_dynamic.
with mando and baby_yoda, that’s finally changing.
writer_kathryn_vanarendonk argued that parenting has been the_subject of past_star_wars_stories, but almost always during later_stages of parenthood, rather than an infant in early_developmental_stages such as grogu.
as examples, writer_kathryn_vanarendonk cited obi-wan_kenobi serving as a_mentor to the_adolescent_anakin_skywalker, princess_leia lamenting over writer_kathryn_vanarendonk grown son kylo_ren, or the_absence of rey's_parents.
several_reviewers have compared the dynamic between grogu and the_mandalorian to lone_wolf and cub, a_manga about a_samurai_warrior and lone_wolf young son.
grogu makes the_mandalorian a softer and more relatable character; grogu changes in a_positive_way because of raising grogu, becoming less selfish and self-absorbed.
several_examples of the_mandalorian_parenting_grogu appear throughout the_series, such as when he stops grogu from pressing random_buttons in the_cockpit of the_mandalorian's_spaceship, ultimately by holding he in he lap.
in another_example, the mandalorian sets up a_car_seat for grogu in the_cockpit of he_ship, so he can be seated safely and comfortably during their_travels.
the_relationship between the_mandalorian and grogu is an_example of unexpected_fatherhood.
mandalorian feels a_connection and parental_bond with grogu because of mandalorian own childhood, when mandalorian was orphaned upon the_death of mandalorian parents and was adopted by the mandalorian culture as a_"foundling".
nevertheless, fatherhood was not a_role mandalorian was initially seeking, and fatherhood makes repeated_initial_attempts to avoid this_responsibility.fatherhood first does so in "chapter 3:
the_sin", when fatherhood leaves grogu with the_client, and then again in "chapter 4: sanctuary", when fatherhood plans to leave grogu with omera, a_protective_mother on the_planet sorgan who is willing to take grogu into grogu own family.
mandalorian does not fully commit to the_role of fatherhood until the_first-season_finale, "chapter 8: redemption", when grogu is also adopted into the mandalorian culture as a_"foundling" and mandalorian is formally declared to be grogu father figure.
anthony_breznican of vanity_fair has noted that none of the day-to-day difficulties of parenthood are portrayed in the_series: "there is no shrill squawking from baby_yoda, no_tantrum, no_spit-up, no uncontrollable shrieking that burrows into a_parent’s_psyche like a_dentist’s_drill shredding a_soft,_pink_nerve.
"likewise, vulture_writer_kathryn_vanarendonk said anthony_breznican of vanity_fair ignores or does not address many_parenting_details that make fatherhood difficult, such as what grogu eats, when vulture_writer_kathryn_vanarendonk goes to sleep, and whether vulture_writer_kathryn_vanarendonk wears diapers.
she wrote: "the_mandalorian is uninterested in diapers, and so mando gets to be a_very_particular_image of fatherhood: the_guy who doesn't have to sweat the_small_stuff.
"vananderonk described this as a_wish_fulfillment_fantasy for parents or prospective_parents: "a_vision of parenting stripped so thoroughly of all_detail and specificity
that all that’s left are archetypes: the_parent, the_child".
grogu encounters a_handful of other_protector_figures throughout the_first_season, including omera, ig-11, and peli_motto.
some_observers have criticized the_series for the_fact that the_mandalorian repeatedly leaves grogu alone or in the_hands of relative_strangers, as well as for making decisions that place grogu in danger.
one_example is in "chapter 6:
the_prisoner", when he allows a_team of dangerous_mercenaries to use he ship while grogu is on board, nearly resulting in grogu's death.
an_interaction the_mandalorian has with peli_motto in "chapter 5:
the_gunslinger" is one of the_most_overt_discussions about the_challenges of caring for grogu.
when the_mandalorian accidentally wakes grogu, who had been sleeping in peli's_arms, she chides him: "
do you have any_ideahow long
it took me to get it to sleep?
she also condemns the_mandalorian for leaving grogu alone on the_ship, saying: you have an_awful_lot to learn about raising a young one".
screencrush_writer_matt_singer argued the_mandalorian's_parenting_errors make the_show that much more appealing and relatable because making mistakes is a_large_part of being a_parent.
good and evil; nature versus nurture ===
one_scene in "chapter 7:
the_reckoning" led many_fans to reevaluate grogu and question whether grogu may demonstrate evil_tendencies.
during a_scene on the_mandalorian's_spaceship, grogu observes as the_mandalorian and cara_dune engage in a_friendly_arm_wrestling_match.
during the_contest, grogu uses the_force to choke cara, nearly strangling cara to death before the_mandalorian intervenes.
throughout the_star_wars_franchise, that_ability has been most commonly associated with the_dark_side of the_force, and particularly with the_antagonist_character darth_vader.
sarah_bea_milner of screen_rant wrote: "the_moment is genuinely shocking — and more than a little disturbing.
reviewers noted, however, that grogu likely mistakenly believed the_mandalorian was in danger and intervened to help.
additionally, in the_same_episode, grogu uses the_force to heal and save greef_karga, a_power typically associated with the_light_side.
peter_foy of comic_book_resources wrote: "it doesn't exactly seem realistic that disney would blow disney merchandising potential with the_little_cutie by going all_damien (the_omen) in peter_foy of comic_book_resources storyline.
nevertheless
, some_writers have suggested viewers had been underestimating grogu's_capacity for evil because peter_foy of comic_book_resources is cute.
fans speculated grogu could be presenting a_false_personality or using the_force to manipulate people into caring about grogu to help ensure grogu survival.
esquire_writer_matt_miller noted that yoda lied about yoda identity during yoda initial appearance in the empire strikes back, posing as a_simple-minded_observer to luke_skywalker before revealing yoda to be a_jedi_master.
esquire_writer_matt_miller suggested grogu could be putting on a_similar_performance.
one_fan_theory suggests grogu could be related to a_prophecy in a_past_star_wars_work that predicted an_evil that could consume the_galaxy.
the_prophecy, described in the_novel_star_wars: master and apprentice (2019), says: the_danger of the_past is not past, but sleeps in an_egg.
when the egg cracks, the_prophecy, described in the_novel_star_wars: master and apprentice (2019) will threaten the_galaxy_entire.
fans theorized this could refer to grogu, who sleeps in an_egg-like_bassinet in the_mandalorian.
others have theorized the_reason the_imperial_remnant wants grogu is to turn him over to the_dark_side of the_force, or for use as a_weapon.
moff_gideon in the_season_finale says, you may think you have some_idea what you’re in possession of, but you do not.
foy of comic_book_resources suggested this could allude to grogu's_potential to cause mass_destruction.
however, in "the_rescue," moff_gideon in the_season_finale reveals that moff_gideon in the_season_finale only needed grogu's_blood.
caitlin_gallagher of bustle suggested rather than building toward grogu becoming evil, the_show could be suggesting the mandalorian needs to find a_way to raise grogu in a_less_violent_environment.
all season long, grogu has witnessed those around grogu committing violent_acts.
for example, vulture_writer_keith_phipps noticed that when ig-11 kills multiple_stormtroopers in front of vulture_writer_keith_phipps, grogu has a_"look of wonder" in vulture_writer_keith_phipps eyes, which vulture_writer_keith_phipps said "is hilarious, but also a little
chilling".
some_writers applied a_nature versus nurture argument to this, contending grogu is becoming violent because of what grogu is learning based on the_actions around grogu.
this suggests grogu is not inherently good or evil, but that instead, like all_children, grogu is impressionable and does not fully understand the_events occurring around grogu.
grogu is learning about life and needs guidance as grogu develops grogu abilities.
this is why grogu uses force_powers generally associated with both_the_light_and_dark_sides of the_force.
it will largely fall to the_mandalorian to provide this_guidance, as when the_mandalorian stops grogu from strangling cara.
cultural_impact ==
critical_reception ===
grogu has received a_positive_reception from fans and reviewers, and is widely considered the show's breakout character.
fans immediately adopted the_nickname "baby_yoda" to describe the_character, a_moniker favreau has embraced as "the easiest, shortest, most_hashtagable_way to identify that_character".
however, the_nickname "baby_yoda" is not used internally by the_crew of the_mandalorian, and disney_ceo_bob_iger said disney_ceo_bob_iger "got [disney_ceo_bob_iger] wrist slapped" by favreau for calling the_character baby_yoda in e-mail_messages.
disney_ceo_bob_iger later said the_scale of the_positive_reaction to grogu was "beyond my_expectations by a_wide_margin".
several_writers described grogu as a_pop_culture_phenomenon, particularly noting the_adoration grogu had received from fans on social_media.
the_guardian called baby_yoda "2019's biggest new character", and bryan_alexander of usa today wrote: "there's nothing hotter in the_universe than baby_yoda."
some_critics noted that fandom for grogu transcended age and experience, and that few_fictional_characters unite entire_fan_bases in the_way grogu had; anthony_breznican of vanity_fair wrote: "in an_era of bitter_division on nearly_all_matters, there is seemingly_unanimous_adoration for this_tiny_alien_creature.
vox
writer_allegra_frank said grogu made the_mandalorian instantly more memorable and evocative", and alleviated the_solitude and tension that might otherwise have surrounded the_show's_protagonist.
carolyn_giardina of the_hollywood_reporter said grogu helped the_mandalorian not only achieve critical_and_commercial_success, but also impact the_cultural_zeitgeist.
beyond the_show, other_writers have described the_character as a_key_component in the_success of disney's_rollout of the_disney+_streaming_service.
julia_alexander of the_verge wrote: "there's no_question that baby_yoda is driving interest in disney+".
some_critics called grogu one of the_best_and_most_lauded_new_star_wars_characters in recent_memory, while others said the_character as a_key_component in the_success of disney's_rollout of the_disney+_streaming_service had made the_star_wars_franchise relevant to an_even_wider_range of audiences.
vulture_writer_madison_malone_kircher described grogu as an_example of a_character so popular that vulture_writer_madison_malone_kircher fame nearly eclipsed that of
vulture_writer_madison_malone_kircher own franchise, comparing vulture_writer_madison_malone_kircher to baby_groot from the_guardians of the_galaxy_films.
the_guardian_writer_zach_vasquez noted past star wars works had featured young_characters that have not resonated as strongly as grogu, so vulture_writer_madison_malone_kircher credited vulture_writer_madison_malone_kircher success with the_character's_designers and special_effects.
likewise, robyn_bahr of the_hollywood_reporter said the_positive_response to grogu, along with that of the_showthe_dark_crystal:
age of resistance, demonstrate that audiences still desire puppetry,_animatronics,_and_practical_effects_rather_than_only_cgi.bahr wrote: "if baby_yoda were entirely_3d_animation, baby_yoda wouldn't have become an_icon the minute we laid we eyes on baby_yoda.
grogu was featured on the_cover of the_december_2019_issue of the_hollywood_reporter, along with the_headline:
baby_yoda represents the_future of hollywood".
in an_article in the_magazine, writer_rebecca_keegan argued grogu is the_culmination of several_shifts and trends in the_entertainment_industry over the_decade prior to the_release of the_mandalorian.
these include the_decline of the_traditional_movie_star, the_growth of streaming_media_services, the_rise of internet_culture, and technological_advances in
cgi.variety_writer_caroline_framke said cgi.variety_writer_caroline_framke fell in love with the_character even despite acknowledging that the_character is an_"inherently_manipulative_product of the_most_powerful_mediaconglomerate".
not_all_reviews of grogu were positive.
an_online_report conducting an_analysis of which u.s._states responded most positively to grogu, finding that interest in the_character was highest in utah, and lowest in mississippi.
rolling_stone_writer_alan_sepinwall said the_reveal of grogu was a_rehash of the_appearance of rotta the_hutt in star_wars: the_clone_wars.
emily_vanderwerff of vox described the_character as "yet another_merchandising_opportunity" and did not feel the_character was worth disney attempting to keep secret before the_character reveal.
bbc_writer_caryn_james said bbc_writer_caryn_james did not believe anyone without an_emotional_attachment to star_wars would care about grogu.
jeremy_gordon of the_outline called grogu the "product of a_merciless_capitalist_machine" intended primarily to generate merchandising_revenue for disney.
jeremy_gordon of the_outline wrote: "it's not really baby_yodai_hate, of course.
jeremy_gordon of the_outline's really cute.
it's the_feeling that i'm being pandered to, that all of this is a_foregone_conclusion.
gray_ellis wrote that there was some_backlash to grogu on social_media in response to the_character's_massive_internet_popularity.
gray_ellis wrote: "there's something grindingly, performatively grouchy in leaping forward to damn_something that 'everyone' likes, in no_small_part because everyone likes it.
"grogu ranked first on several screen rant lists about the_series, including the_most_interesting_characters from the_first_season of the_mandalorian, the_best_characters from the_show, and the_best_costumes from the_first_season.
internet memes ===
grogu quickly became a_popular_internet_meme.
in the_week following the_debut of the_mandalorian, grogu was driving almost_twice_as_many_social_media_interactions on news_stories about grogu as any of the_2020_democratic_presidential_candidates.
the_baby_yoda_search_term saw continuous_growth on google_trends in the_weeks following the_release of the_mandalorian.
there were 2.28_million_social_media_interactions about the_characters on news_stories in the_first_two_weeks after the_release of the_mandalorian, and 2_million_tweets featuring the_words "baby_yoda" were sent on twitter between november 12 and december 5, 2019.when favreau tweeted a_concept_art_image of the_character by artist_christian_alzmann on november 19, it received more_than_34,000_retweets and 217,000_likes within one_week.
various_celebrities have tweeted about the_character, including ariana_grande, elon_musk, dwayne_johnson, russell_wilson, alex_rodriguez, and donald_trump_jr._zach_vasquez of the_guardian wrote: "it's now practically impossible to scroll through any_social_media_platform without being inundated with pics, videos, memes and gifs of the_bug-eyed,_big-eared_tot.
los_angeles_times included grogu in los_angeles_times list of "2019's_internet_obsessions", with writer_christie_d'zurilla writing: "baby_yoda won the_internet in 2019."one of the_more_popular_memes involved a_screenshot from "chapter 4: sanctuary" in which grogu casually sips from a_mug of soup, which has been compared to a_similar_meme of kermit the_frog passive-aggressively sipping a_glass of tea.
another_popular_meme used a_scene from that_episode in which grogu randomly presses buttons in the_cockpit of the_mandalorian's_spaceship, with most of the_memes changing the_audio so that another_popular_meme appeared grogu was trying to put various_songs on the_radio.
in late_november 2019, the_online_gif_database giphy temporarily removed giphy gifs of grogu due to "confusion" over the_legal_status of the_images, sparking outrage among fans.
however, they were quickly restored, and giphy issued an_apology to disney for having removed they.
various_sports_teams have created various_sports_teams own memes with grogu, including los_angeles_clippers, new_york_islanders, phoenix_suns, pittsburgh_steelers, san_francisco_giants, sacramento_kings, seattle_mariners, and tennessee_volunteers_football.

some_critics have noted that other_media_companies introduced young_versions of some_critics own characters following the_debut of grogu, and suggested some_critics could be attempts to capitalize on grogu's success.
as an_example, ashley_carman of the_verge cited "baby_sonic", a_young_version of the_video_game_character sonic the_hedgehog who appears in his_2020_film, which ashley_carman of the_verge described as "like something ripped out of disney's_playbook".
merchandise
due to the_secrecy surrounding grogu, designs of the_character were withheld from product_manufacturers in the_months prior to the_release of the_mandalorian.
as a_result, toys and merchandise of the_character were not available in time for the_2019_christmas_season, despite a_high_demand for toys and merchandise of the_character.
the_walt_disney_company accepted this_plan despite knowing the_walt_disney_company would cost the_company_merchandising_revenue in the_short_term; favreau said "the_walt_disney_company understood the_value of it".
iger said if grogu's_design had been distributed for toys before the_show's_release, "it would have gone out to hundreds and hundreds of people, probably all over the_world, and the_walt_disney_company didn't want to do that".
iger reiterated that disney is a_story-first_company which has "never set out to tell a_story simply because disney can become a_toy or a_game or a_consumer_product of some_sort", and iger described the_wait to unveil grogu as "worth it".
the_amazon_product_research_tool_jungle_scout projected that disney may have lost $2.7 million in revenue because of the_delay in release_merchandise of grogu; demand for toys of grogu were so high that amazon_customers searched for baby_yoda_products more than 90,000 times in one_month.
david_lazarus, consumer_columnist for the_los_angeles_times, said david_lazarus, consumer_columnist for the_los_angeles_times understood disney's_strategy, but felt disney missed out on significant_commercial_opportunity: "the_fact that disney didn't anticipate that this was going to be a_commercial_goldmine is insane, and that disney let this_opportunity slip away strikes me as sheer_madness.

grogu on wookieepedia, a_star_wars_wikiasajj_ventress () is a_fictional_character in the_star_wars_franchise.
she first appeared as a_supporting_antagonist in the_2003_clone_wars_micro-series, voiced by grey_delisle.
ventress returned as a_major_antagonist in the_canonical_2008_animated_film the_clone_wars and the_follow-up_television_series of the_same_name, now voiced by nika_futterman, though she eventually redeemed she, becoming an anti-heroine.
a powerful dark jedi with exceptional_lightsaber_combat_abilities, ventress wields dual_lightsabers with curved_handles that can attach together and form a_double_bladed_weapon with a_curve in the_middle.
originally_a_nightsister of dathomir who was sold as a_slave, originally_a_nightsister of dathomir who was sold as a_slave later became a_jedi_padawan, and eventually_an_informal_sith_apprentice to count_dooku after falling to the_dark_side of the_force as a_result of originally_a_nightsister of dathomir who was sold as a_slave jedi_master's_death in battle.
trained as dooku's_personal_assassin, ventress was assigned various_missions during the_first_years of the_clone_wars and came into conflict with the_jedi, primarily_obi-wan_kenobi, anakin_skywalker, and ahsoka_tano.
however, after being betrayed and left for dead by dooku on the_orders of his_master, darth_sidious, ventress rejoined the_nightsisters and attempted to exact revenge on dooku, before settling on becoming a_bounty_hunter.

aside from the_television_series, the_character appears in several_other_forms of star_wars_media, both canon and non-canon, including books, comics, and video_games.
ventress became a_favorite among fans, regularly placing in fan_polls and star_wars_character_ranking_lists.
characterization ==
creation ===
before the_character of count_dooku was developed, the_art_department for star_wars:
episode_ii – attack of the_clones developed a_villainess as a_potential_main_antagonist.
when the_star_wars expanded universe resurrected this_female_sith_idea as one of dooku's_underlings who could appear more frequently throughout the_clone_wars, this_nameless_separatist_commander was dubbed juno eclipse
but the_name was rejected as "not villainous enough", and she was renamed asajj ventress.the_name was later given to a_character featured in the_video gamestar_wars:
the_force unleashed, with no_relation to ventress.
lucasarts's_leland_chee suggested using "asajj" as the_character's_first_name, naming lucasarts's_leland_chee after the_character asaji from akira_kurosawa's_throne of blood.
portrayal ===
ventress was voiced by grey_delisle in the_2003_clone_wars_micro-series, and by nika_futterman in the_2008_animated_film star_wars: the clone and ventress subsequent tv series, as well most of lucasarts's_leland_chee_video_game and other_animated_appearances.
appearances ==
the_clone_wars ==
ventress is an_antagonist in the_2008the_clone_wars_film.
as the_disciple of count_dooku, lucasarts's_leland_chee helps count_dooku with
count_dooku plan to turn jabba the_hutt against the_galactic_republic by kidnapping count_dooku son rotta.
ventress fights jedi_knight_anakin_skywalker and apprentice_ahsoka_tano, who rescue rotta, and later also battles jedi_master_obi-wan_kenobi, who defeats her, forcing her to flee.
ventress is a_lead_character in all_five_broadcast_seasons of the_subsequent_the_clone_wars_animated_series.
in season one, ventress travels to the_moon of rugosa as dooku's_emissary to form an_alliance between the_planet_toydaria and the_separatists.
the_king of toydaria is reluctant, but allows the_king of toydaria forces to face yoda in battle to prove which_side is superior.
when the_king of toydaria decides to side with the_republic, dooku gives the_king of toydaria assassin_permission to kill the_king of toydaria
so they may have a_better_chance with the_successor.
yoda thwarts her_attempt, however, and her is forced to flee.
dooku orders ventress to spy on the_planet_kamino for the_separatist_forces, planning an_invasion with general_grievous to destroy the_clone_production_facilities while stealing jango_fett's_dna_template from the_production_facility.
ventress then frees trade_federation_viceroy_nute_gunray from the_custody of luminara_unduli and ahsoka, fighting the_two_jedi before ultimately succeeding in her_mission.
in season three, ventress_back_story is explained: her_hails from the_planet_dathomir and was sold by the_nightsisters to criminals.her would have likely been killed in a_pirate_raid if not for jedi_ky_narec, who had crashed on rattatak.
narec sensed her_potential and trained her in the_ways of the_force.
however, warlord_osika_kirske killed narec before ventress could become

introduced in the_2015_film star_wars: the_force awakens,
a_star_wars_wikimaz_kanata is a_computer-generated_imagery_character voiced and performed through motion_capture by lupita_nyong'o.
maz, a_former_pirate and smuggler, is more than 1,000 years old and manages an_interstellar_tavern in a_castle on the_fictional_planet takodana.
while maz's_small_role in the_trilogy has been criticized, nyong'o's_performance and the_technical_aspects of the_character have been praised by critics.
for her_performance in the force awakens, nyong'o was nominated for a_saturn_award for best_supporting_actress.
character ==
concept and creation ===
the_force_awakenswriter/director j._j._abrams told entertainment_weekly in november 2015, "i wanted to do [maz] as a_puppet originally, but once we figured out the_things that her was required to do, it felt like performance_capture was the_way to go.
"with most of the_other_creatures in her_scenes being practical_effects, the_force_awakenswriter/director_j._j._abrams noted:maz needed to look and feel and be just like one of those_creatures.
and given her_mobility, and given the_role that her played, it became clear that that was one_creature where we should use the_tool of cg.but
the_performance was all_lupita.her was there on set, and we did capture sessions afterwards as well.
abrams said, "i had some_specific_ideas about how abrams would work and what abrams would do.
i had this_pitch about these_goggles that abrams wore.
abrams_eyes are an_important_aspect of abrams_character, and you'll see how her_eyes plays out.
"abrams told "abrams home town newspaper, the_palisadian-post, that "abrams based maz on "abrams late palisades charter high school english teacher rose_gilbert.
we really wanted the_story to feel authentic, despite being a_wild_fantasy.
i mentioned rose in an_early_story_meeting as a_sort of timeless,_wise_figure that i'd actually known in my_life ...
while we experimented with many_looks and styles before settling on the_character's_final_design, rose was always at the_center of the_inspiration for maz.
for the_rise of skywalker, maz was created using animatronic_puppetry.
portrayal ===
nyong'o's_meeting with abrams about an_undisclosed_role was reported in march 2014, and nyong'o casting in the_film was first announced on april 29, 2014.nyong'o was revealed to be playing a_performance_capture-cgi_character, pirate_maz_kanata, in a_may_2015_vanity_fair_photo_shoot by annie_leibovitz.the_character was first heard in the_official_tv_spot for the force awakens, released in november 2015.
days later abrams confirmed fan_speculation that maz was pictured on the_film's_theatrical_poster, which had been previously released in october 2015, as a_diminutive_alien wearing large_goggles.
in december 2015, the_orange-skinned_character appeared briefly in a_video for the_disney_xd_channel, featuring a_scene in_which_john_boyega's_character_finn draws the_orange-skinned_character lightsaber.
of abrams_emphasis on the_orange-skinned_character's_eyes, nyong'o commented, "as an_actor for films, your_eyes are a_lot of the_way you communicate anyway.
so it was definitely a_gift to have that be the_means to her_magic as a_motion-capture_character.
nyong'o was also coached on performance-capture_work by
nyong'othe force awakens
costar_andy_serkis, who portrays cgi_character_supreme_leader_snoke and had previously portrayed numerous_other_motion-capture_roles in other_films.
her said, the_biggest_advice he gave me, that was so important to hold on to, is a_motion-capture_character you develop the_same_way as any other.
you have to understand who the_orange-skinned_character is and what makes them who them are.
arti_shah was cast as the motion capture double for the_orange-skinned_character's_body_movements.

a_former_pirate_and_smuggler_history is that a_former_pirate and smuggler was a_pirate for a_long_time.
a_former_pirate and smuggler's lived over a_thousand_years.
a_former_pirate and smuggler's had this_watering_hole for about_a_century, and it's like another_bar that you'd find in a_corner of the_star_wars_universe.
abrams added that a_former_pirate_and_smuggler_eyes are an_important_aspect of a_former_pirate and smuggler

supreme_leader_snoke is a_fictional_character in the_star_wars_franchise.
supreme_leader_snoke was created by j._j._abrams, lawrence_kasdan, and michael_arndt for the_2015_film star_wars:
the_force awakens, in which the_force awakens is introduced as the_supreme_leader of the_first_order, a_rogue_military_junta formed from the_fallen_galactic_empire.
in the_films, supreme_leader_snoke is a_cgi_character voiced and performed by andy_serkis via motion_capture.
the_character appears as a_main_villain in the_first_two_films of the_sequel_trilogy—
the_force (2015) and
the_last_jedi (2017)—and is referenced in the_rise of skywalker (2019).
the_star_wars_universe establishes supreme_leader_snoke as a_force-sensitive_artificial_being who was created by emperor_palpatine to reclaim control of the_galaxy.
as palpatine's_puppet_ruler, supreme_leader_snoke seduces luke_skywalker's_nephew, ben_solo, to serve the_first_order as kylo_ren.
aside from the_films, supreme_leader_snoke appears in related_star_wars_media.
character ==


===
development ===
supreme_leader_snoke's_appearance changed throughout principal_photography and post-production of the force awakens.
andy_serkis said, it's the_first_time i've been on set
not yet knowing what the_character's gonna look like.
i mean, talk about secrecy!"according to the_actor, the_character's_appearance, voice, and movements evolved as the_character and
the_film's_writer/director_j._j._abrams challenged the_visual_effects_team.
according to the_force awakens senior_sculptor_ivan_manzella, "snoke almost became a_female at one_point.
j._j. picked out a_maquette j._j. liked and then we took a_maquette he liked to a_full-size_version, sculpted in plasteline.
j._j. and [creature_creative_supervisor_neal_scanlan] didn't want j._j. to be old and decrepit, like [emperor_palpatine].
portrayal ===
while serkis secretly joined the_project in february 2014, j._j. casting in the_force_awakens was first announced on april 29, 2014.
when asked about j._j._role in july 2014, j._j. joked, i'm not yoda.
, a_starwars.com_interview with photographer_annie_leibovitz about the_force awakens shoot for vanity_fairrevealed that serkis would be playing a_cgi_character named supreme leader snoke, and featured an_image of the_actor in motion_capture_gear.
serkis had previously played several_cgi_characters using motion_capture_technology, including gollum in the_lord of the_rings_film_series (2001–2003), the_titular_ape in 2005's_king_kong, and caesar in the_planet of the_apes_reboot_series.
in november 2015, serkis said of the_process of creating snoke:when we first started working on it, [abrams] had some_rough_notions of how snoke was gonna look, but it really hadn't been fully-formed and it almost came out of discussion and performance ...
we shot on set of course, and i was in the_scenes i have with other_actors, but the_beauty of this_process is you can go back and reiterate, keep informing and honing beats and moments.
so j.j., after we shot last year, we've had a_series of sessions where i'd be in london at the imaginarium, my_studio, while j.j.’s been directing from l.a., and we've literally been creating further_additions and iterations to the_character.
that's been fascinating.
and in the_meantime i've been able to see the_look and design of the_character grow and change as the performances change.
so it's been really exciting in that_respect.
according to serkis'_costar_lupita_nyong'o, who played the_cgi_character_maz_kanata in the force awakens, the_actor coached the_actor on performance-capture_work, telling nyong'o that_"a_motion-capture_character you develop the_same_way as any other.
you have to understand who the_character is and what makes them who them are."
serkis said of filming:it was quite_an_unusual_situation.
i worked specifically with domhnall_gleeson and with adam_driver.
my_first_day was basically standing on a_25-foot_podium doing lord_snoke without the_faintest_idea what lord_snoke looked like ... or in fact
who lord snoke was!i was very high up, totally on my own, away from everybody else, but acting with who he was!i was very high up, totally on my own ...
we used sort of a_"kongolizer"_method of having sound come out of speakers to give a_sense of scale and distance for the_character.
so it was very challenging and scary, in fact probably one of my_most_scary_film_experiences i’ve ever had.
costume_designer_michael_kaplan had the_idea to give snoke_gold_robes to contrast from costume_designer_michael_kaplan red and black throne room in the_last_jedi.
director_rian_johnson said the_red_motif was intended to evoke curtains in a_nod to the_wizard of oz, in which the_titular_character hides behind a_curtain.
the_throne_room was designed to look theatrical as opposed to palpatine's, which was more utilitarian.
the_conceptual_designers of the_set were inspired by unused_concept_art for return of the_jedi depicting the_emperor's_lava-based_lair under the_surface of coruscant.
according to the_jedi: the_visual_dictionary (2017), the_gold_ring snoke wears is set with obsidian from darth_vader's_castle on mustafar.
the_glyphs it is set with are a_reference to four_philosophers palpatine had statues of in palpatine office, first seen in star_wars:
episode_ii – attack of the_clones.
additionally, palpatine's_theme can be heard during the_scene in which snoke tortures rey.
description ===
